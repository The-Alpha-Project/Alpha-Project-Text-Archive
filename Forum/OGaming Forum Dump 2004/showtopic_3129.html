        <!-- THE POST 35121 -->
        <div class="postcolor"> I would very much appreciate if somebody posted the following suggestion in the official WoW suggestions forum, as i cannot do that myself. I hope people are allowed to post suggestions in this forum. If you post this in the official forum please include everything between the // marks. Thank you.<br/><br/>//<br/>--This post started out as a suggestion but grew quite large :). You might want to read the end first.--<br/>A WoW suggestion by SyNTaX aka Tanelko (tanelko@hotmail.com)<br/>In WoW there should be quests which are not simply completable (not like &quot;kill # monsters, get that etc). Though many quests are different and not repetative, there should be some which you cant just literally &quot;take on&quot;. They will solve throughout your game course. I&#39;ll write an example.<br/><br/>                          ***<br/>One day in Teldrassir you see a strange man. After talking to him he tells you of his friend in trouble. He gives you a starting quest. After you meet his friend and do what he asks that first part is completed. He gives you a reward and gives a HINT (this is where the real thing begins). Let&#39;s say he tells you that he has somewhere heard of a hero, who was in search of some hidden treasure and later on lost. He says that he last say that hero&#39;s friend in some city (let&#39;s say Ironforge). He tells you that friend&#39;s name.<br/><br/>Some time when you are in Ironforge you might want to find that guy. Eventually you talk to a barman who says he had seen that guy not very long ago, and he had gone to look for the friend near the ruins of Lordaeron.<br/><br/>After looking around near the ruins for a long time (or just by luck) you find a note which calls for help. The friend has been captured by one of the apothecaries of the Undercity. You will have to find and follow a route of items he has dropped (his sword scabbard, a few coins, a shoe etc.) and so you find the dungeon where he is kept. From there he must be rescued (for which you might look for some help as many dangerous creatures can be found inside. After fighting those and saving the man he tells you what had happened. The hero he looked for had been killed, but he found a note on the treasure he was searching. It said somehting about a man named 9Bill]. Bill was said to live on the eastern border of Kalimdor, where he had created friendship with the native centaurs. On his way back from the search he (hero&#39;s friend) had been captured by the apothecary. Shortly after telling you this valuable information the friend dies.<br/><br/>As the next part of the quest you have to find Bill. As you do, it comes out that the centaurs aren&#39;t very happy to let you in. You have to prove that you can be trusted and help the centaurs kill some tauren. That has to be done near a base where there are players on the side of the Horde too. After doing this the centaurs tell you to bring them the head of the tauren warchief from that camp (who is quite well protected.) You might again call a few friends to help you.<br/><br/>With the tauren&#39;s head the centaurs finally let you talk to Bill (this name should be changed for sure). You get the information that the now dead hero was looking for. Bill was the keeper of an ancient chest made of a material not seen before in the world. Bill himself believes that it came from the world beyond the dark portal and once belonged to one of the brave heroes who had ventured there. Bill also knows that there is a special key (with a circular-ish shape) that is needed to open this chest and he take all that is found inside.<br/><br/>Now begins the longest part of this big quest: the search for the key. As Bill gives you no hint nor clue about where to find it, you are on your own.<br/><br/>[The beginning of the next part could take weeks or even months]<br/><br/>On some bright day when you are exploring the vast and big world you come up to a temple. In this temple you see a man, who has learned all about legendary objects, legends and heroes. You have an option to ask him about the strange chest what Bill has. Luckily :] he knows about it. He tells you that the key had been split to three parts as the chest was believed to hold something very dangerous. The parts of the keys had been spread through the world some time ago before the war against the Scorge and the Burning Legion. The man knows about two parts. One had been given to the gnomes. He suggests you talked to their elder named Jake (change the name as i have no ideas...). The other one, as he knows is held in a deep dungeon of the Undercity. Unfortunately he has no information about the third part, but he tells you he will try to get some from his big collection of ancient books.<br/><br/>The quest for finding the key parts begins. As the first one you should (but don&#39;t have to) go to the gnomes and find the elder Jake. You get some information that Jake had gone to live in the mountains a long time ago. It won&#39;t take long for you to find Jake&#39;s residence (which has a small and badly hidden entrance and is completely underground). You cannot enter that place but you talk to somebody inside. That somebody is Jake&#39;s son John. You get to know that some years ago Jake died. But he agrees to give you Jake&#39;s diary (for a decent price of course&#33;). Reading the diary you get to know the location where the key part is buried. It is a map of a nearby area (which you must locate) and you have to dig the thing out. You find a chest :]. Luckily the diary says that the key for it is in the hands of the leader of the gnomes. After talking to him and telling your story he says: &quot;Hmm, i think it would be very interesting to find out what is inside Bill&#39;s chest. I do not have anything agains giving you my key, but Jake warned me not to give it out.&quot; You inform him of Jake&#39;s death and to prove it you shouw him the diary. After that he gives you the key, you open the dug out chest and get the first key part of the three. <br/><br/>You decide you should show it to the man in the temple (who first told you about the key parts).<br/>As he realises that you are serious on your quest he tells you more about the second part. It is said to be hidden in one of the deepest catacombs of the Undercity. That place had been cursed and doomed and even the Forsaken themselves are not allowed to enter it. He tells you that you should find a strong ally from the lines of the Forsaken, who would betray Sylvanas and team up with you.<br/><br/>This won&#39;t happen very easily. To find a Forsaken ally, you have to venture in their lands. Eventually (yes again after a long time) you hear a conversation, where a member of the Forsaken is banished from his home town because he is believed to do deals with some humans. He is not executed, however, because there is no certain proof. As he walks away you have to talk to him. He is a strong mage and you have to fight him. As he comes towards quite low hitpoints he starts to quickly run away. You must follow him into his little cave-home and corner him. There he surrenders and agrees to do anyhing for you. (You have to be quite strong to wound him and do that alone). After he gets to know that you have not come to enslave or kill him, he isn&#39;t so very rejective anymore: he had been cast out from his own kind and had no place where to be. He promises to aid you in your quest.<br/><br/>Next you have to gather many items and take them to the banished Forsaken. These include clothing and armor of the undead and some rare ingredients for an ancient ritual. This ritual is believed to take you to the world of the Undead for about an hour. Getting all the neded things might also take quite a while. After all is set he performs the ritual and you become (for a certain period) one of the undead. He says that after the effect expires you might experience some loss of memory, but nothing serious. <br/><br/>During you being undead, you can only use and carry objects used but the Forsaken (those that you at first gathered. After putting on the clothes, you fit very well to be one of the undead. The Forsaken outcast mage also gives you a special letter, with what you should get into the Undercity. The items you previously carried are stoed at your &quot;friend&#39;s&quot; home.<br/><br/>Now you must go there. The letter mentioned before has to be shown to the guards. It says somtething about a massive raid of the Alliance on the Undercity and you say you have to deliver it to some important guy in the Undercity. You are let in. Inside you must stay away from real Forsaken mages, as they might suspect something. The letter includes a small map of the great Undercity and some special wall is pointed out. You have to find the wall as quickly as possible, as after entering the Undercity a timer appears showing you how long you have time before the effect starts to wear off (something about 50 minutes). After getting to the wall you see a hole. Something in your backpack is pulling towards it. It is a strange gem given to you by your &quot;friend&quot; mage. You put the gem in the hole and a portal appears. Nobody else seems to notice it. You go through it and find yourself in the forbidden part of the Undercity (the one where noone should enter) You have to riddle, puzzle and fight your way through the dungeon (average less than 30 minutes) and in the end find the second part of the key. After taking it some strange statues in the key room start moving. This is a good time to hit the road, as they become some high level (80, if 60 is max then 60) guardians. After running back to the beginning you step through the portal and find yourself in the usual Undercity again. Having done everything right you should have about 15 minutes left before you rehumanize (or re-nightelf-alize or smth.) You make your way to the exit but there your trick is discovered. You are attacked by the abominations and mages near the entrance and you have to run like hell, as one chases you. The guards keep chasing you and slowly the screen begins to fade. You have to stay alive at all costs. Then the screen suddenly darkens and stays that way for a little time.<br/><br/>You wake up in the house of the &quot;friend&quot; Forsaken mage. He tells you that he had fought back the enemies and taken you back to his home. His missing left arm proves that. He hand you the second part of the key which he had had a look at. you thank him and once again as a human (or smth) you leave the lands of the Forsaken and head back to the man of the temple)<br/><br/>He is very much pleased to see that you had done somthing that he had thought impossible. Unluckily he has no idea where the third part of the key could be.<br/><br/>You wont howerver find that out before you have taken the two key parts you have back to Bill, who puts them together and is very much amazed. He hands you back the key with one part missing and you feel a sudden pull. Bill is certain in that these two parts are trying to locate the third. You have to follow where the key guides you. It takes you to an island in the far end of the sea. You find the ruins of a temple overrun by some demons. It is a good idea to call some extra assistance and fight your way to the middle of the place, where you find the third and the last part of the key. You unite all the key parts and they form a shining and glowing circular key.<br/><br/>Quite surely you head back towards Bill. But as a nasty surprise you don&#39;t see a single alive centaur. All of them, including the human Bill have been slain by the mad tauren tribe, who before lost their warchief. That is proved by a lot of tauren bodies lying around the place. You find no clue about the chest.<br/><br/>If you are smart enough, you go to the camp where you previously killed the tauren chief. This is the last time where you might need some help, but it&#39;s not too hard. You have to fight your way to the great hall of the camp, get the chest and get out of there. When in peace again you can open the chest and the quest is finally completed. As a reward you should get a great deal of experience, maybe some gold, and an unique item, the one from the heroes who ventured beyond the Dark Portal, and that item (depends on your class, could be a sword, a bow, an axe or smth.) is powerful and has different special abilities. The item cannot be sold to other players or NPCs. It is something you might want to keep for te rest of your WoW life, and it takes no bank room as it is a special, rare, long quest item, one of those you might not get any more of. You will also get the chest, which acts as a bag and can be put into the bank to increase your storage room (by a LOT)<br/><br/>I will shortly take this long quest together:<br/><br/>PREQUEL - the first guy&#39;s small quest and giving the hint about the hero and his friend<br/><br/>PART 1 - Finding the treasure.<br/>I - Finding the hero&#39;s friend. - You must locate the friend of the hero, who looked for the treasure.<br/>II - Saving the firend. - You must save the friend from the apothecary.<br/><br/>Part 2 - Meeting Bill<br/>I - Tauren slaughter - You have to prove yourself to the centaurs by killing a certain number of tauren.<br/>II - The warchief - You have to bring the head of anearby taurenc&#39; camp&#39;s warchief to the centaur.<br/><br/>Part 3 - The first key part<br/>I - Finding a clue - You have to find somebody who knows anything about the strange treasure chest<br/>II - The man&#39;s advice - You have to find Jack, th gnome who hid the first part of the key.<br/>III - The diary - You must find the chest with the gnomes&#39; part of the key.<br/>IV - Getting the first key part - You have to talk to the leader of the gnomes to get the key for the chest.<br/><br/>Part 4 - The second key part<br/>I - A Forsaken ally - You have to find somebody of the Forsaken to help you.<br/>II - The chase - You have to chase down the Forsaken mage and make him talk to you.<br/>III - Preparing the ritual - You have to get the mage some certain objects to turn you undead for a while.<br/>IV - To the Undecity - You must get nt the undercity and find a portal to the forbidden catacombs.<br/>V - Alone in the deep - You have to find the second part of the key<br/>VI - The escape - You must quickly leave the Undercity and try to get to your Forsaken &quot;friend&quot; before the effect of the rtual wears off.<br/><br/>Part 5 - The third key part<br/>I - One missing - Try to unite the two key parts (Only Bill can do it) and get to know where the third is.<br/>II - The forgotten part - Get to where the third key part is believed to be.<br/>III - The dark temple ruins - Fight your way through the demons and retrieve the third key part.<br/>IV - Back to Bill - Go back to Bill&#39;s residence<br/><br/>Part 6 - Opening the chest<br/>I - Find the treasure chest<br/>II - Go to a safe place and open the treasure chest.<br/><br/>-THE END-<br/>            ***<br/><br/>Some notes: <br/>-All of the parts and phases (I, II etc.) have small rewards of exp and maybe some minor items or money.<br/>-If your friends help you do something, they wont get what you do (the key parts), only experience.<br/>-The quest can be started very rarely and not always at Teldrassir, in other places too.<br/>-After Bill&#39;s death only you see him dead. For other players at his camp he still is a live and fights anyone who tries to enter.<br/>-You can reoerform the ritual of becoming undead if you should be caught in the Undercity.<br/>-The key parts cannot be dropped or traded.<br/><br/><br/>Well i think this quest and other long-term quest would be a great addition to WoW.<br/>Sorry for the mistakes i have made, there might be many.<br/>Oh and if i am mistaken in any way of the storyline (about the places, names, events, story) then it is because i do not know very much of it.<br/>//  </div>

        <!-- THE POST 35124 -->
        <div class="postcolor"> Although I did not read your post in entirety, I believe your suggestions have already been implemented into the game. This refering to the hints given about different quests and the unlockable quests after completeing the one you&#39;re currently on.<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040821070646/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/quests.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/quests.shtml</a><br/><br/>In the example Blizzard gives us of a quest. You are performing a quest given to you by Brill&#39;s Magistrate Sevren, and as you are near completion of the quest, you find Alaric&#39;s head which was not mentioned by Brill&#39;s Magistrate Sevren whatsoever, that gives you a quest. Thus you have gained another quest by performing another.<br/><br/>However, if the point you are trying to make is to include more a step-by-step &quot;mystery quest, (Refering to the use of information from a dying man at the end of a quest in order to pursue a seperate one that is still linked to the first.) then I must say that it is an interesting idea that may easily be incorporated, it is all simply up to the quest creators.  </div>

        <div class="postcolor"> Please also include the notes, these are important too<br/><br/>Some notes: <br/>-All of the parts and phases (I, II etc.) have small rewards of exp and maybe some minor items or money.<br/>-If your friends help you do something, they wont get what you do (the key parts), only experience.<br/>-The quest can be started very rarely and not always at Teldrassir, in other places too.<br/>-After Bill&#39;s death only you see him dead. For other players at his camp he still is a live and fights anyone who tries to enter.<br/>-You can reoerform the ritual of becoming undead if you should be caught in the Undercity.<br/>-The key parts cannot be dropped or traded.<br/><br/><br/>Well i think this quest and other long-term quest would be a great addition to WoW.<br/>Sorry for the mistakes i have made, there might be many.<br/>Oh and if i am mistaken in any way of the storyline (about the places, names, events, story) then it is because i do not know very much of it.<br/>  </div>

        <div class="postcolor"> Liquid/Mogrin, please post this text at the post you made at Quest Discussion (a very cool quest), i want to reply the people there.<br/>//<br/>Reply from SyNTaX<br/><br/>ShaftWindu: that is one of the main points of the quest, it is meant to take a long time. It took about an hour and a half to write. I came up with the initial idea in a day and wrote it the next.<br/><br/>Jute: i think they could use instanced parts of the land, so that Bill&#39;s camp, Jake&#39;s hideaway, the place where you get the Forsaken ally etc. could be varied. However, spoilers, yes, might ruin much of it. But i&#39;m sure roleplayers and those who want to get the max out of WoW would enjoy this.<br/><br/>Maybe i&#39;ll add another quest soon. I have an idea already :)<br/>//  </div>
