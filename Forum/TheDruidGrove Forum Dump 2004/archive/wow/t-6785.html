<br />
Posted by Rob Pardo - Blizzard<br />
 GFraizer is going to put together a death penalty page, but in the meantime, I thought I would clarify some issues.<br />
<br />
Here is the description from the interview:<br />
<br />
    Q u o t e:<br />
    When a player dies, he or she will appear at a nearby bindstone as a ghost. While in ghost form, a player can neither be seen by nor see the living. The player must now travel back to where his or her corpse is to become corporeal again. Finding one's corpse will be easy, since players will have a minimap marker that clearly shows the way. Because the player's ghost won't be detectable by monsters, the journey back to the corpse won't be dangerous. After getting close enough to where the corpse is, the player will receive the option to be resurrected a small-but-safe distance from where he or she originally fell (to avoid any nearby monsters). Once the player becomes corporeal again, there are no further penalties for death.<br />
<br />
    Should a player choose not to retrieve his or her corpse, a Spirit Healer (ghostly NPC) will be available at the bindstone to resurrect the player there for a modest loss in experience.<br />
<br />
    Of course we are still exploring the death-penalty system and will be flexible in keeping our options open for future changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mini F.A.Q.<br />
<br />
OMG! Corpse runs suck! Why have them Blizz?<br />
Well, we need to have a death penalty of some sort, otherwise death itself becomes meaningless. I think most people are confusing corpse runs from other games with this one. 9/10 times when you die, you will want to return to your death location anyways just to continue playing the game. In most cases it is LESS harsh a death penalty than we had before.<br />
<br />
Why not just have the old death penalty where players got a debuff and appeared at their bind location?<br />
Mainly because it operated as a free teleport. Once someone wanted to go back to town, you would find the nearest monster or lake and promtly die in it. Not only did this not work great as a death penalty but it created lots of bizarre behavior in regards to transportation in the world.<br />
<br />
Doesn't this new penalty allow free scouting?<br />
Remember you cannot see monsters or players, so what exactly are you scouting? We also plan to make the world look somewhat different when you are a ghost that will furthur de-emphasize any scouting you can do as a ghost. Also, in some rare locations where we do not want players to &quot;scout&quot;, some monsters will be able to see ghosts and attack them. Dying as a ghost will make you re-appear at the nearest graveyard.<br />
<br />
What about dungeons?<br />
You cannot explore dungeons as a ghost. You may only enter a dungeon in which you have a corpse, and you will turn corporeal as soon as you cross the instance line.<br />
<br />
How long are the corpse runs?<br />
It really depends on how far from a graveyard that you die. It could be a 30 second run, or it could be much longer. During beta we will tune the maximum range but it will probably be in the 5-10 minute maximum area.<br />
<br />
What if I re-incorporate on a monster?<br />
When you get near to your corpse (30 yards or so), you will see nearby monsters ghost in, so you can pick a good spot to re-incorporate and not die again immediately.<br />
<br />
Can ghosts see other ghosts?<br />
Yes. Players may also find ways in the game to see ghosts. Lastly, we would like to eventually add ghostly NPCs that may have quests for ghosts or world lore.<br />
<br />
How does it work in PvP?<br />
This is not determined yet, but it has been discussed with this penalty in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
------ follow up answers through page 7 ------<br />
<br />
<br />
i like this death penalty but i wish there were a way to go back to your bindstone(or whatever its called) without losing the xp(assuming your corpse is far away or in a dangerous region), maybe going back to your corpse and having the option of porting back to the town you binded in<br />
There will be many methods of fast travel around the world. Some classes can teleport, while anybody can use Gryphons to travel quickly to town.<br />
<br />
what happens if you go LD, or logout while in ghost mode?<br />
nothing – but when you log back in you will still be a ghost<br />
<br />
ok, so what happens when a PC resurects me? do i lose some exp?<br />
No, but you will have resurrection sickness for a short time. All your stats and your overall combat ability will be reduced for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
In PvP, would this not lend to corpse camping? Or is that a factor?<br />
No, since you can re-incorporate within a 30 yard radius near your corpse.<br />
<br />
Can Ghosts swim? If so, does the air-limit still apply?<br />
Ghosts will simply levitate over the water. If your corpse is in water, you can swim down to it to re-incorporate. Ghosts do not need to hold their breath underwater.<br />
<br />
I really liked an idea some guy had a long while back. His idea for a Death Penalty was an EXP Debt. You don't loose any exp. But the next time you gain some exp, a percentage goes to the exp debt.<br />
Exp debt and Exp loss is really just the same thing, except you can’t lose your level.<br />
<br />
Don't expect Pardo to reply, much less read your responses.<br />
He just posted it to test the water, and figured he'd only rehash this system if there was an overwhelming response, so much that he would know without reading the forums.<br />
Bitter much? Blizzard employees constantly read these forums, but we have Katricia to reply to most questions. I just know this is a rather controversial issue, so I thought I would let her off the hook on this one.<br />
<br />
OK, hello, isn't this basically free transportation to a different dungeon then? Do you take the exp hit if you enter an instance?<br />
No. Once again, you CANNOT enter an instance in which you do not have an active corpse (meaning your most recent). You may only enter the instance in which you died. Once you cross the instance line, you will re-incorporate on the other side.<br />
<br />
So when you are done in your dungeon, just commit suicide and return to the entrance with your ghost instead of journeying out? People might opt to do that in big dungeons with a bindstone near the entrance.<br />
That would be possible if we placed graveyards right next to dungeons, but I doubt we will do that.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, what about Priest/Pali/Druid ressurection skills? Do they summon the ghost closer or something?<br />
No, resurrection spells may be cast on a player’s active corpse. The receiving player may then choose to accept the resurrection, which will re-incorporate them on top of their corpse with full gear, but with resurrection sickness.<br />
<br />
Can a player be rezzed by a shaman or druid at the spot where they died or do they automatically appear at a bindstone as a ghost?<br />
When you die, you will appear at the nearest graveyard, but your corpse remains a valid target for resurrection spells.<br />
<br />
If people choose to have their corpse's revived at the bind stone for the experience fee, is it possible to level down if you have just recently leveled up like in FFXI?<br />
No, you cannot lose your level. However, your experience in a level can go below zero. So, if you have experience below zero, it will take you longer to gain your next level. This is also the case for the maximum level. Over time we will add more levels to the game, so even max level characters will need to be somewhat careful with losing too much experience.<br />
<br />
So in other words, you can still use it as transportation. First die, then sacrifce some experience to be resurrected at the bindstone, so you end up the same way you would if you died in DAoC to get back to town. The fact that you don't have to lose experience does make it less likely that people will do this, but many people still will, especially people who don't have time to manually get back to town.<br />
Sure, and in the tuning process we will try to find an amount of experience that discourages this.<br />
<br />
What if i die and disconnect from WoW ? will my corps still be where i left it when i died ?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Now when it says the spirit healer will res you at an xp loss, does that mean at the bind stone, or at your corpse? and if it's at the bind, do you get all the stuff on your corpse?<br />
They will resurrect you at the graveyard with your gear intact.<br />
<br />
This death penalty isn’t harsh enough &lt;insert reasoning here&gt;<br />
One of the fundamental philosophies we have had throughout the development of World of Warcraft is to remove overly frustrating elements from other MMORPGs and make the game FUN. Of course, you cannot take this too far, since you also need players to respect the world which is why things like falling damage, death penalties, and other elements exist. If players do not feel like they are overcoming obstacles then the game does not feel rewarding enough. We would rather make various encounters in the game be the difficult and challenging part of the game, not trying to decide if I’m willing to lose 1-8 hours worth of progress to replace equipment or experience already earned in the game. Most of the development team are hard-core gamers themselves, so we do plan to have plenty of challenges and rewards for players that choose to take them on.<br />
<br />
<br />
------ follow up answers through page 9 ------<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a question, the terms &quot;bindstone&quot; and &quot;graveyard&quot; seem to be thrown about interchangeably in this thread. Are they the same thing?<br />
Graveyards are replacing bindstones.<br />
<br />
So does this new death system mean that bind stone are no longuer in the game since now you re-appear as a ghost in a graveyard and can be resurrected in that graveyard ?<br />
Correct, bindstones no longer exist in the way they did before. I have been using the term “graveyard”, but we are still discussing exactly what we want the art to look like. It may even change based on the zone.<br />
<br />
Also, when you mean the closest graveyard, is it possible that you will come back as a ghost in a part of the world that you haven't explored yet since that graveyard is closer to your corpse than a graveyard you went through ? If so, will ghost be able to go through object or will they have to find their way through this unexplored land back to their corpse (I assume that the general direction of the corpse will be indicated)?<br />
Yes, that is possible, but we will strive to place graveyards in such a way to minimize this. However, since you have a pointer on your minimap, it should still be relatively easy to find your corpse even from an area that is new to you.<br />
<br />
Also, there are several points which talk about the &quot;nearest&quot; bindstone or graveyard. Are we to assume this means we don't have to actually walk up and tag these things anymore, and that the game automatically decides which is closest and ports us there? Are some of these faction specific (I wouldn't want my orc ghost sent to the human city).<br />
That is correct, there is no longer a need to explicitly “bind” yourself at a bindstone/graveyard. By continuing to allow this would only make it more likely for people to death teleport over a large amount of the world, and would punish people that forgot to bind nearby.<br />
<br />
I have not seen anyone raise is the issue of corpse decay. It's very bad to lose all your items after being unable to retreive your corpse. However, without corpse decay, starting areas would be wall to wall corpses. Personally, I would like to see a time limit that would force experience loss rather than item loss; i.e. if you can't get to your corpse within a few hours, you are automatically revived by the Spirit Healer--with your items.<br />
I can’t remember the actual timer on corpses, but it is pretty long. Once your active corpse decays we will resurrect you at the nearest graveyard. Undetermined if there will be experience loss for this.<br />
<br />
I am also curious to know what types of communication will be allowed in ethereal form. Will it be limited to gibberish ala UO, or restriced completely?<br />
No public chat will be available to ghosts, but private chat like /tells, /guild and /party chat will still be allowed.<br />

<br />
Nope.  No XP penalty if you run to your corpse.  I'd like to see a fantasy based MMO used the Ghostwalk campaign option for D&amp;D as their death system.  Some of the stuff in the WoW death system is similar, but not quite the same.</div></div><hr />

Player rez spells will not cost you xp, but they will give you a temporary debuff (most likely less time than it would have taken you to run back).</div></div><hr />

If u die it means u have to start over.. thats the penalty right there. Running  naked around the world with the possibilty of getting killed isn't fun.. I really like the ghost and if you use the NPC to rez you.. well then you get the penalty because you didn't work to get back. As for rez's well thats will be the group configuration, and who knows what type of rez effects you will have. <br />

I like this system coming from a hardline guild myself.</div></div><hr />

Death penalties are very light in Horizons and there are always people who complain about that.  Must have more ashes and sackcloth.<br />
<br />
I am a little unclear on the amount of time the ghost walk takes.  If we are talking about a completely safe 15 minute walk, I think I would find it pretty annoying.  In some ways this feels a little bit like what I saw of DAOC's ... you had a forced timer that let you rez (seemingly without consequences at low levels) but the higher your level the more you had to wait before you could recall yourself.  <br />
<br />
Same could be in effect here...the higher you go the farther you have to travel to get back where you were.<br />
<br />
That is what happens in Horizons too...you always recall to your bind point but have to run back whereever you were.  The higher your level the farther you will tend to be from anywhere convenient when you die because the higher level mobs are farther from towns.<br />
<br />
It is ok...but we will see how it plays in WOW.<br />
<br />
Seems that Sigil is still holding onto the EQ standard (the old one) for painful death penalties - everyone else (every sane game company) is going light these days.<br />
<br />
Still, EQ worked - whether it is (partly) because of or in spite of the death penalty system ... who can really say for sure?</div></div><hr />

Take a peek at FoH's board. Sheesh. You'd think they'd want employees of EQ or blizzard to be standing next them with an axe so in case they ever died, they would be slain in RL, as that is the only thing that gives them a rush is the fear... actually, they don't fear dying, they fear losing their corpse. Now, how many people actually have LOST a corpse in EQ. I played in the early days myself, and while it was extremely tedious, and time consuming to get a group to get your corpse, I never actually FEARED it. It just frustrated the HECK out of me. Some people must equate frustration with fear. <br />
<br />

<br />
Perhaps it wouldn't be so crazy or uncomprehensible if you knew that this was the original plan for Horizons =-p It was originally slated to have perma-death and character aging in it, along with tons and tons of other stuff that was changed or pulled for better or worse in one of the many delays/media blackouts.<br />
<br />
And the death penalty in WoW sounds alright. So what if it's completely safe 5-10 minute walk? At least there is a little bit of sight seeing to do on the way back, instead of just staring at your death point for awhile before you warp back. Death needs to have some penalty, in this case you choose to make it time getting back to your corpse (where as said, you probably want to go to start hunting again anyways...) or you can save yourself a &quot;corpse run&quot; and take an experience loss that you'll have to spend time making up. Either way the penalty comes out the same: Time. And it's a pretty light time penalty, so that most probably won't mind it, at the very least you won't hear much complaining about it being too harsh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh...ok...PVP....with real player death...in a MMOG?  So you have to start over from level 1 every time you die and you die all the time in MMOG's no matter how good you are.  And people are actively trying to kill you all day long.<br />
<br />
A ridiculous idea.  Kind of proof of how loopy the original dev team of Horizons really was.<br />
<br />
That kind of approach works fine in a shooter where you have no time or energy invested in your character, but there are not gonna be more than a handful of people out there willing to keep releveling a mmog character every few days.<br />
<br />
perma-newb characters just don't sound fun to me.</div></div><hr />

In SD, you're out till someone wins the map or time runs out (usually less than 5 mins total map time). <br />
<br />
In both these cases, the death penalty is a few minutes at most, however, this does NOT stop you from wanting not to die. But yet, we have people who want to take half your gold, lose a level, all your items, etc when you die... WHY? LOL. The time penalty (at least for me) is a enough to deter me from doing stupid things that would get me killed.</div></div><hr />

There needs to be rare items to give a sense of accomplishment and gloating ability but the way of going about it, endless camps in EQ, makes the game absolutely no fun.  The time required to be &quot;successful&quot; in EQ is what drove both of us away.  I think quests like the high-elf mask, as he mentions, are nice.  Relatively quick but high-risk.  But the problem is that over time, sometimes quickly, the risk all but disappears.  Something is always easier the second time.  Look at a guild that works on an encounter time and time again and fails time and time again.  When they finally succeed the encounter, it becomes &quot;farm status&quot;.  It is very difficult to lose an encounter after having won it before.  How can future games be different?  The only things I can think of are having encounters related to the quests that give the rare items be dynamic.  You would have to have a few dozen possible events that could occus simultaneously in different numbers of combinations making preparation very difficult, but it becomes very difficult to code correctly without the errors that EQs simple encounters are already plagued with...<br />

<br />
I think we unwittingly created an encounter system that made it such that camping was seen to be more efficient from a min/max standpoint than actually 'doing' a dungeon (the latter being our intent). <br />
<br />
There are several other instances where our original intent didn't turn out to be the 'norm' when it comes to playing EverQuest (pulling, FD, resurrection at higher levels, kiting, too much downtime (e.g. boats) and more). <br />
<br />
The Vision didn't always turn out to work the way we'd envisioned, and the Vision is always something that's evolving as we learn more and more about these games and what makes them tick. I think the ideals remain the same, but hopefully we're learning more and more about how to realize those ideals. <br />

Yes and no.  You don't HAVE to go to the boat.  You can just take a Wayfarer teleport to Natimbi.</div></div><hr />

There needs to be rare items to give a sense of accomplishment and gloating ability but the way of going about it, endless camps in EQ, makes the game absolutely no fun. <br />
<br />
Well, I don't particularly like the fact that MMO's are so item driven really.  It seems like that became the end-all be-all of EQ.  In other games I played, completing an adventure or quest was the goal of the game.  But acquiring more powerful stuff is in almost every game, it just isn't the complete and total focus of many of them. <br />
<br />
I think WoW might be on the right track.  If there are rare drops, one will drop for each person doing the quest.  That way you don't have endless farming.<br />
<br />
And again, I think the rarity of items should be something that you don't have to spend more than a few hours to acquire any one particular drop you need on a quest.  I think EQ was insane with some things only spawning once every several days for quest items.<br />
<br />
Then again, what there were certain ultra-rare spawns that actually start some unique quest?  Maybe they'd spawn randomly in the world.  You couldn't camp them.  It would be pure dumb luck to get started on a quest like that.  The rest of the quest wouldn't require any sort of camping, or at least, not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm planning on doing something like that with the NWN module I'm working on.  It'll be a module that's geared to run 24/7, with some quests automated by NPC's.  Most quests however, will be DM and storyline driven.  It'd be great if you could make a game world where trusted players could create their own quests to added into the game world.</div></div><hr />

Apparently it isn't item driven at all.  I'll be interested in checking it out, although it doesn't have what I think an ideal superhero mmog needs(pvp and ability to play villains).<br />
<br />
Going back to the permadeath thing, specifically addressing one of Oak's posts...  I dunno, I think a game with Permadeath could be really spiffy.  The thing is, it obviously wouldn't work in any game thats out right now.  They all seem to be designed around the fact that you will most likely die a lot.  At the early levels you may have escaped it, but in a game like EQ, you might have died multiple times at a given level.  Not to mention, raid level encounters where it is a given that multiple people will die.  <br />
<br />
But what if dying wasn't the norm?  What if you had to almost go out of your way to die.  IE, at level 1 you decide to go out and fight *the* dragon, passing many &quot;Danger, you don't want to be here&quot; signs on the way.  For me, the sheer amount of dying that occurs in MMOGs definitely takes me out of the game and makes it hard for me to immerse myself in the game.  I'd love to encounter a game where dying was a rare and significant thing...  And if permadeath was the price for that kind of gaming dynamic, so be it.<br />
<br />
Having said that though, in a game like WoW, which I imagine will be slanted towards dying being fairly common, then their proposed death system sounds great.<br />

Unless you want to go to Abysmal Sea, which I do sometimes for the fish and once to do the tradeskilling faction quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, Horizons (yep I beat that drum I know ; ) ) is already out there as a game that is not predicated on rare loot.  Everything is crafted, and loot drops simply don't exist.  It is one of the things that excites some of the most vituperative responses from players of the game.  The idea that loot drops are *the* reward for playing the game is very deeply entrenched these days.  Thank EQ for it perhaps.  I know in single player RPG's my characters most often were wearing vendor sold gear in most slots with a handful of very rare items.  The higher your level, the better the gear you found on vendors.  I found even Diablo - the ne plus ultra of dropped loot in a single player RPG - worked that way for me.  It never really bothered me, but then in a single player game it is really about story.<br />
<br />
Burgundy - on the perma death thing.  I think I get what you are saying but it still would be a trick to have a game like that work.  If there is little or no risk of death, but when you die it is permanent, I think players would generally find the game dull.  That also suggests to me that there would be some seperate system that worked more or less like death penalties that were not in fact death ... say a low health auto port back to where you started that had negative consequences.  <br />
<br />
And it begs the question how to do anything like that in a PVP mode where players will be tempted to hunt down those weaker than themselves (griefers really).  <br />
<br />
I suppose I could imagine something like you are saying in an abstract way but I can't put together the pieces in my head in a formula that is playable, enjoyable, and materially different from just having a death system.<br />
<br />
I suppose one approach is what the old wizardry games did...every resurrection carried a remote chance of reducing a character to unrezzable ash rather than resurrecting them.  Of course, that really really sucked when it happened, and I can't imagine it would be any more fun in a MMOG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it would be difficult to come up with a creative and still fun way to do it, of that there is no doubt.  I've thought about this in the past, but at the moment I'm a bit too frazzled to put forth some of my ideas on how it could be done.  Maybe later.  :)</div></div><hr />
