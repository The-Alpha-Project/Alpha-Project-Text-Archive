<br />
The closed beta test is coming to an end. This Friday, October 29, at 3:00 PM PDT, the closed beta servers will go offline as we prepare to run another stress test. All active closed-beta accounts will remain active, and closed-beta testers will be receiving an email with instructions on what to do to continue playing in the stress test.<br />
<br />
We will post more information about the stress test in the days ahead, so please stay tuned to WorldofWarcraft.com.<br />
<br />
We also want to take this opportunity to thank the closed beta testers for their months of dedicated testing and hard work. Thanks to all of your suggestions and bug reports, World of Warcraft is closer than ever to being ready for launch!<br />
<br />
In unrelated news, we will be bringing the beta servers down today at 6:30 PM PDT for maintenance. We estimate that the maintenance will last for one hour, and when the maintenance is complete, we’ll bring the servers back online. Please keep in mind that this is an estimate; should anything unexpected arise, we’ll post further notice in the Server Status forum (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/board.aspx?fn=wow-server-status). Thanks for your patience.<br />

Is this open beta, or something else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why another stress test I wonder?  Maybe a player wipe to test the character creation servers?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know if they are saying &quot;stress test&quot; as in open beta or not.  Kinda weird wording.<br />
<br />
I think I would actually go read the WoW boards if there was a player wipe...that would keep me entertained ALL day at work =P<br />
<br />
But unless they did some serious internal testing or the pally/hunter talents, they need all those higher lvls to test them out..a player wipe wouldnt be a smart move.</div></div><hr />
