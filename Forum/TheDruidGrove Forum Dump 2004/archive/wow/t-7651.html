Funniest part is that many of the spells are the same name as in EQ... funnier yet is that it sounds like WoWDruids mirror EQDruids.</div></div><hr />

The creators of EQ played D and D and also &quot;barrowed&quot; ideas from early text based games.<br />
<br />
 I believe D &amp; D even had a &quot;Moonfire&quot; type spell/name along with these druid abilities: teleporting, dots, summoning storms, tracking, living off the land, healing changing shape, summoning animals etc.</div></div><hr />

Sounds damn fun. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have read of druids in WOW, especially considering it is more of a PVP oriented game than EQ, I would be concerned that over time they are going to be heavily around the face and head with a nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

The names being similar or the same is fine with me, no need to reinvent the wheel, especially for healing, regen, thorns spells.  It doesn't sound to me that they will mirror EQ druids though.  Yes, many of the spells are similar, but look at shapeshifting, completely different in WoW and EQ.  It sounds like druids will be a decent back-up tank or tank in a pinch in bear form as well as decent melee DPS in cat form.  Even in your normal form, melee sounds like it will be a much bigger part of the play-style.  Who knows though, I am not in beta :)</div></div><hr />

All of the classes that I've played are strong in their own right. Only few issues I see with druids getting nerfed. I've also seen things with Rogues and Priests that are too powerful. But then again, this just might be what blizzard is aiming for. Power.</div></div><hr />

Beta Phase 1 Lagged me to no end. In a major city? Forget about it, I was lagging so bad I would skip. Beta Phase 2 the game overall runs better. Even on my 2 year old computer.<br />
<br />
Birds already exist in the game rideable by anyone anyway. Why add lag giving this to druids as well. I could understand this being a vaild reason to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

I was actually looking forward to flying around as a raven. At least the panther/cat form looks like it's going to be all I was hoping and more. I was very surprised to discover that the feline form will offer the ability to feign death! Should be interesting. Now I'm not quite so worried about the great power that Priests appear to wield.<br />
<br />
I still want Form of Wrulan in EQ.</div></div><hr />
