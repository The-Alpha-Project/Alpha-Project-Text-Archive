<br />
One of the many things that will be going into our next push is the inclusion of our new skills system. While I do not know all the ins and outs of this system yet, I do know one thing that I think everyone will like. <br />
<br />
Currently when a player wants to take a tradeskill for the first time, they must locate the specific trainer, find them, and pay the necessary skill points/coin. This can sometimes be frustrating as you run in and out of buildings or yell blindly to the world “Where’s the ________ Trainer!!” <br />
<br />
In the next push, all tradeskills will be listed as a part of your interface. If you have the necessary amount of skill points, you can just select the skill … no trainer necessary. <br />
<br />
You will of course still need to seek out the trainer to gain recipes and to go up in rank but I think many will agree that not having to find the trainer right away is a nice benefit. <br />
<br />
I’ll be listing more “next push” information as it comes to me. <br />

<br />
It does seem a bit odd - when I first read it I assumed it was simply for the testing process, so testers could get access to skills and test them more easily, but that it wouldnt make it to release.<br />
<br />
Am hoping that enough testers are against over dumbing down of the game, that thread was encouraging - also alternative suggestions were made as to how to remove the problem - annotated maps for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am totally against dumbing down the game.  They could put guides into the game or let guards answer simple questions about where trainers and other merchants are in the town.  You can see that in EQ in some places, like Shar Vahl.  Ask any guard in shar vahl where the forge is.  It's not very informative... but with a little more work, it could be made useful.</div></div><hr />

The cardinal rule of any good game designer (although, not necessarily for MMOG devs) , when looking at an activity in a game, you must ask yourself &quot;Is this fun?  Am I having fun doing this?&quot;  If the answer is no, as this obviously was, then it needs to be redesigned or abandoned.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone has the kind of time we can pour into these games. And if someone has to spend 30 minutes running around shouting &quot;Where's the ****ing trainer&quot; because some designer had his head up his *** and placed it behind a wall on a 2nd floor of a non-descript building... out of their 1 or 2 hours a night playing time, they are going to get pissed, and rightfully so. It isn't &quot;skill&quot; to find a trainer, it's a matter of a) having a map you printed off a spoiler site for us hard core people, or b) running around screaming like a chicken with its head cut off. <br />
<br />
All the things EQ has done to make it more newb friendly, &quot;old school&quot; people complain about. However, if those things had been in place when THEY had been newbs, they certainly wouldn't have complained about it. But yet, because they had it needlessly tougher, they want everyone to suffer as much as they did. That's a craptacular reason to keep old dumb ideas around. Misery loves company I guess. I, for one, like seeing all the new stuff they do for newbies. <br />
<br />
Corpse runs: Not fun.<br />
4 hour travel times to get to an xp spot for your level: Not fun.<br />
Massive downtime between fights: Not fun.<br />
Rare spawns that drop rare items needed for quests: Not fun.<br />
<br />
Sure, some people are masochists and love camping 72 minute spawns for days on end or having 8 hour corpse retrievals, but I am not one of them. Neither are most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rahjeir</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Comes down to the player too. You don't have to be a hardcore person to find stuff. You have to be a person who wants to play the game, and not ask for everything to be handed to you. You buy the game to figure stuff out as entertainment. Isn't this why you read a book or movie too? Find out where the story goes and how it ends? <br />
<br />
&quot;Dumbing&quot; down the game to a degree isn't a bad thing persay. Somethings should be pointed out more clearly. But there is a line where the gamemaker needs to know not to cross. The line from helping, to handing stuff on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
Current changes to WoW, I don't think are handing players stuff on a silver platter. There is still alot of stuff you need to learn on your own. But of course the changes havn't happened yet. Hard to judge or belittle a game change that hasn't been released or even tested yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callahad</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tough question.<br />
<br />
For a virtual world to last, it needs to have a rich flavor to it. Some of it can be had by doing stuff like having specific places where you can get stuff at. Kinda like having to run to Thurg to get some tradeskill ingredients... Having a complex interactive environment with NPCs can be part of a rich flavor. <br />
<br />
Sure, it may not be fun (though I disagree; it might be frustrating at times, but you can appreciate the role-playing element of it), it may turn down some subscribers... But in the end, will it be worth it? Will more players appreciate the world for a longer time? I couldn't tell ya.<br />

There's always alot of people on those beta boards that are anti-time sinks of any sort (e.g the corpse runs, or any death penalty at all!!, request insta travel wherever they want to go) but the vocal majority seemed to think that this change wasnt necessary.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that to progress up in a trade skill you still need to find your trainer for recipes and such like.<br />
<br />
Still its hard to really get a feel for it without being in Beta too.... :(</div></div><hr />

Ok, now my comments on the subject.  I don't mind if the trainer isn't needed to be found right away.  Doesn't seem to be a game breaker to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhoo... I agree that timesinks are bad.  As bad as idiot level/zone design.  It's something I have personal experience with in NWN.  Over time you learn to achieve a nice balance of maintaing a rich atmosphere and immersive enviroment without making it too complex and without making it a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
You have to balance things.  EQ is too heavy handed on the timesinks.  WoW, if it continues to be dumbed down, will be far too light on the timesinks.  It's a delicate situation to balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as far as i see it this is a minor change and shouldn't really be seen as a game maker or a game breaker, thinks about it, you want to learn how to shoot a bow, pick one up and give it a go, chances are you'll end up with a blackened thumb or a nice cut between two fingers, but you learned something, and didn't need to ask someone how to pick it up and pull it back...<br />
<br />
As long as they make sure you still need to find the trainer to advance, i don't think they're handing anyone anything beyond making it easier to know what's available and to experiment with certain things at low levels.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get in game and see the world.</div></div><hr />

You want to learn a tradeskill, and you just learn it without someone teaching the basics to you?<br />

If the problem was finding the tradeskill teacher/master, then they should have come up with ways to find him more easily (like posted here in this thread already: A'Kanon guides, DAoC guards, ...).</div></div><hr />

Godwin's Law<br />
Godwin's Law     prov.     [Usenet] &quot;As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&quot; There is a tradition in many groups that, once this occurs, that thread is over, and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever argument was in progress. Godwin's Law thus practically guarantees the existence of an upper bound on thread length in those groups. However there is also a widely- recognized codicil that any intentional triggering of Godwin's Law in order to invoke its thread-ending effects will be unsuccessful. <br />
<br />
<br />
So yes, it appears a new law has been observed.  As the length of a thread on any EQ class forum grows longer, the probability of invocation of the &quot;silver platter&quot; approaches one.</div></div><hr />

Well they should be or else they should stop the false advertising. *shrugs*  EQ, WoW, SWG, DAoC have all pushed themselves as role-playing games.  Instead they're just a game of selfish desires and the drive to be the highest level with the neatest toys.  That's not an RPG.<br />
<br />
I hope to be applying for a position as a paid Game Master for a game scheduled to be released Q4 2004.  It was pointed out to me on the rogue channel recently and it's got a lot of what I'm looking for.  That being said, I would do that job for free if given the chance if the game can pull off what they plan.<br />
<br />
I hope to get into some phase of the beta for it so I can fully evaluate the potential of the game before I make  such a life altering decision, since if I was hired... it would require relocating to a different country.  Although I hear the scenery is gorgeous up in Nova Scotia.  If the game is fun and the maker's desire to create a truly immersive enviroment for roleplaying... I'll be doing whatever I can to get hired and make the move possible.<br />
<br />
On a completely distracting note...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I never considered NWN, Baldur's Gate, or any of those to be &quot;RPG&quot;s either. Sure, you played a &quot;role&quot; in the story, but comparing what you do in those games, vs what I have done in pencil-and-paper D&amp;D/Shadowrun/Danger International/Vampire/Mechwarrior/Rolemaster/Rifts/Earthdawn/L5R, etc amongst many others, is .... well, so many orders of magnitude different as to not even be in the same realm. <br />
<br />
No computer &quot;RP&quot; game has even approached 1/1000th the role-playing/fun I had with friends sitting at a table way too late at night eating stale pizza and drinking flat Dr. Pepper :D.<br />
<br />
I've played a bunch of MUD's and MOO's and MUSE's, etc, back in the day too, and while there was some RPing in some of the MOO's I was in, it again just can't compare to face to face action, especially with a DM/GM present. Without that &quot;judge&quot;, roleplaying can really suck. &quot;Hail, dark stranger, you look evil!&quot; &quot;Ok, die, I shoot you in the eye with my .44 caliber pistol. You are dead.&quot; &quot;Hey, no I'm not!&quot; &quot;Yes, you are. I shot you, you are dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh, I've seen that kind of stuff and it cracks me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, NWN does approach the RP fun I have had with my friends at a table.  It just requires putting forth some effort to find a good group to connect with and a capable DM or two or three.  That's what's cool about NWN.  You can have four DM's logged on to a server and fifteen players running around.<br />
<br />
As long as the DM's stay away from scripted conversations, they can keep a good game running for months without spending too much time plotting out every conversation, etc.  I know it lacks the face to face aspects of pnp, but it's damn close to pnp with a good dm.  I think Wish is going to be a good step towards making a good RP online game as well.  Can't wait for the next chance to apply for beta.</div></div><hr />
