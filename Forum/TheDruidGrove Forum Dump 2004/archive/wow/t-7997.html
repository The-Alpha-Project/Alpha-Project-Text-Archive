<br />
    * Several improvements to the Mail system have been made:<br />
<br />
          o The mail interface no longer changes back to the inbox after sending a new mail (it remains in the send mail tab).<br />
<br />
          o Mail that has been read is now greyed-out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it seems to have improved performance for me a great deal, as my video card is by far the most impressive part of my system and my processor was slowing down the 2d rendering and killing my framerates... There's a soft glow to everything now that will appeal to some, for those who want the older look back without the glow you can simply go into your video options in game and turn the &quot;full-screen bloom&quot; setting off, so far i'm not sure whether i like it better on or off.<br />
<br />
The switch to a 3d cursor and changing the combat numbers from sprites to 3d rendered effects is a nice improvement too, and some of the other effects in game are vastly improved.<br />
<br />
My rogue and druids stealth and prowl respectively no longer look as strange, where you used to be able to see all the polygon faces through yourself when you stealthed, now you only see what you'd normally see when you aren't semi-transparent, it's a small thing but a nice touch.<br />
<br />
They've also fixed the standing while riding bug when things hit you etc.  Now you sort of stand then slide back into position, it's a huge improvement.<br />
<br />
Blizzard says this is a small patch without a lot in it. It seems to have improved things a lot more than they give themselves credit for.<br />
<br />
As a side note, some players using ATI graphics cards are seeing pixelization, that's due to the full screen bloom effect, turn it off until ATI updates their drivers to support the pixel shaders properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What size are your WoW folders now?  It seems that the new patches don't override the old ones?  This last patch required 2.4GB of free space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blizzard has done &quot;dirty&quot; patching up until this last push in the beta, basically just making the game look at newer files of the same name.  It looks like they may be going a cleaner way now by having the patcher replace files instead of just duplicating them.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the files aren't compressed or optimized as they will be in release, and if you want a smaller install you're best bet is to grab the latest client released and patch that up to date (it's a fair bit smaller)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have crashed more with this patch than any of the previous ones =/<br />
<br />
Doesnt seem to be as stable any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed some issues on my machine here at work, thought at home it's been the most rock solid patch yet.  More than anything it's been the known bugs that are bothering me, such as the locked/inaccessable UI while on a gryphon etc (reloadui in the console fixes that, but it has to be done every ride).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that wisps around Dolanaar are now black instead of white - could be a graphics driver thing, but it wasn't happening before the last patch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have an ATI card make sure you have the absolute latest drivers, as a lot of the 9.0c implementations are borking older ATI driver versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I have an ATI card - it had the latest drivers as of August 3rd when I installed Doom3, because that required an update as well :)<br />
<br />
I'll check for a later one.  Thanks ;)</div></div><hr />
