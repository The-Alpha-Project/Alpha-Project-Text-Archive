<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The WoW community site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) is back up now, and Blizzard has been busy posting information.<br />
<br />
On open beta:<br />
The overwhelming demand for the World of Warcraft open beta test has resulted in hundreds of thousands of successful signups. We have already reached our target number of testers and therefore must regrettably close our account creation pages. We'd like to thank everyone for showing such interest in joining the World of Warcraft open beta test and would like to reiterate our appreciation of your continued patience during our website outage. Please note that we will continue to analyze server population, and should there be more space for testers prior to the game's launch on November 23, we will re-open the signup pages.<br />
<br />
And the Collector's Edition info:<br />
We've received a number of inquiries requesting further details about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/wow-oldnews.html#collectors&quot;&gt;World of Warcraft Collector's Edition&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available along with the standard edition at launch on Nov. 23. To answer the most popular questions that have come up, we'd like to provide the following additional information about the pets that Collector's Edition owners will be able to choose from, and how the 10-day pass that comes with the Collector's Edition will work.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Collector's Edition Pets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
The special pets included with the Collector's Edition are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/images/04-11/pets.jpg&quot;&gt;Panda Bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/images/04-11/pets.jpg&quot;&gt;Zergling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/images/04-11/pets.jpg&quot;&gt;Mini-Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
Players who have purchased the Collector's Edition will be able to obtain their special pet by submitting the gift voucher found in their character's inventory to a special NPC located in each starting area. Players will then be able to choose from one of the three special pets.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Collector's Edition 10-Day Guest Pass&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Players who will be accessing the game through the 10-day pass will create their account for that exactly the same way as a normal player, by visiting the account-creation webpage.<br />
<br />
Those who wish to continue playing the game once the 10-day free period is over must first visit their local retailer or online store to purchase a copy of World of Warcraft. Once they have obtained a copy of the game, they can log in to WorldofWarcraft.com using their 10-day pass login information and then enter the authentication key that came with boxed copy into the field found at the bottom of their account page.<br />
<br />
That's all that's required to activate a full-fledged World of Warcraft account once the 10-day free period has expired. Any characters that players have created during the 10-day trial, along with all their items, will be available for them to continue playing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and the Mini-Diablo pet is sweet! I'm so totally getting the Collector's Edition for them pets. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was over on Test 8 and I have to say, the lag made it unplayable.  It was taking my newbie gnomie 5 minutes to kill anything (then 3 more to loot it).  I'm hoping that Blizzard simply hasn't opened up all their bandwidth pipes to full yet.  Or else, launch is gonna suck!<br />
<br />
Also, for the Collector's Edition, for those of you who are into Warcraft art, the Art of Warcraft book rules - I got mine with the CE of WC3 and it was well worth it.  I'm still thinking about the WoW:CE hoping that the book might have been updated a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've purchased my Collectors Edition :)<br />
As for the lag... well, that's going to happen during the open beta, Blizzard doesn't have nearly all of their servers up at this point and are in fact still &quot;stress testing&quot; to see where they can do some server side improvements to combat that same lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lotharun</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game was hella fun to play last night even with the lag.  It's not nearly as pretty as EQ2, but it is very friendly towards my video card.  The game has the feel of immersing yourself into a cartoon world which surprising works well.  It's as if you dialed up Samari Jack on your TV and dove in through the tube.<br />
<br />
I did several newbie quests and they also aren't quite up to the EQ2 standard, but close.  Picking your reward from choices in WoW was very nice.  Combat in WoW is better in some ways.  I didn't like always losing sight of my target when I tried to switch to a side view of the fight.  Not really a big deal, though.<br />
<br />
It's a four day weekend for me.  I hope the servers stay up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All servers, last I saw, were at HIGH capasity. What makes it even more interesting; there was over 30 servers!<br />
<br />
Over 400k downloads logged at FilePlanet (for the OB) alone. This isn't counting the who knows how many hundered K used the BT download (through WoW or SuprNova). <br />
<br />
I think the desire for this game is just a bit overwhelming. :lol<br />
<br />
Hopefully Blizzard will get things back ironed out after a few server tweeks here and there. At least this gives Blizzard a real understanding of the demand for WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oddjob1244</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wish they would release this game, and every other high end game, on DVD that wasn't just for those that purchased the collector's edition. I really dont want to pay 30 extra bucks for a DVD copy. <br />
Yes the servers are completly slammed right now. The real stress test has begun. During the FilePlanet only stress test there was zero lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, for the Collector's Edition, for those of you who are into Warcraft art, the Art of Warcraft book rules - I got mine with the CE of WC3 and it was well worth it.

<br />
I'm almost positive I read somewhere that the art book is completely different.  The title itself: &quot;The Art of World of Warcraft&quot; lends credence to that.  I can try and dig up the post on that if you need it.<br />
<br />
I've preordered the CE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over 400,000 downloads - that number is just from FilePlanet downloads alone isn't it?  It doesn't include all the people who were already in Closed Beta who downloaded through Blizzard's Torrent, or an alternative torrent server.<br />
<br />
Those are huge numbers!<br />
<br />
My Collector's Edition pre-order has been in for a long time now :)<br />
<br />
I wonder if all the characters on that account get the pet, or just the first one you create?  I'd love to have the panda bear for one char, a diablo for another, etc. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I read that every 'toon on the CE account will have the ability to choose a pet.  I can't find that post though, and the search on Bliz's WOW site seems fubar'd.<br />
<br />
And Burg, that's what I'm hoping for, but heck, I'd even settle for a hardback version of the original ;)  I didn't pre-order for the faint glimmer of hope that one of the big retail chains will have it discounted on the release day.  Soo... maybe $75 instead of $80 =|</div></div><hr />
