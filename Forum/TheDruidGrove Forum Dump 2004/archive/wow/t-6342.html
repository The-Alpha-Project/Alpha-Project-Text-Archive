<br />
&quot;Blizzard's game philosophy has always been that it's all about the player experience, not the designer's ego.&quot;<br />

Initially you had corpse runs to get back your stuff.  Clearly they decided this was costing them money as PoP and LDoN both have grave yards so you don't waste hours trying to get back the corpse.<br />
<br />
I actually liked SWG when death was not a big deal and you could actually use it to tport back to town.  It made exploring and trying stupid (eg. fun) things enjoyable as there wasn't a downside.  &quot;Think us 3 can take that big mean looking monster?&quot;  In SWG we would try and occasionally we could beat it.  If we loose we are out the 5-15 minute travel time and we could try it again.  In EQ we could be out a whole lot longer than that.  Games are to have fun playing in.  I am sick of the time sinks, which is why I departed EQ years ago.</div></div><hr />
