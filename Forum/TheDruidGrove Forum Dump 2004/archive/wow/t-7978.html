<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing a bit more and ran across a couple of things that I wondered about.  Anyone feel free to jump in here - I'd appreciate any help :)<br />
<br />
1 - I reconfigured my keyboard to be like I had it in EQ, but there is one thing I can't get to work.  In the settings is a 'pitch up' and 'pitch down'.  I assumed these were for the camera and I bound them to pgup and pgdn keys, but when I press them in-game, nothing happens.  How do I bind the camera so that when I push pgup, I look up and pgdn makes me look down?  I know I can right click and pan around, but I'd like this option too as that's how I'm used to playing.   And what do the two 'pitch' options do?<br />
<br />
2 - I remember reading somewhere that the longer you play, the less xp you get for killing mobs.  Was this implemented?  I noticed as I'm killing level 5/6 owls and nightsabers that the experience I get per kill varies wildly on mobs of the same level, like I'll kill an owl and get 77 xp, then kill a few more level 5s and suddenly I'm only getting 62xp, then later I notice it's 50xp per kill, etc.  Am I seeing this right?  And is there a way around it?<br />
<br />
3 - One day before logging, I was just sure I had accepted a 'gather me these items' quest last week, then with the extended downtime I didn't get to play for nearly a week.  I logged in today and that quest was not in my journal any longer.  It's possible that I never actually accepted it, but I thought I did.  Or do quests cancel if they are not completed within a certain time?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
2 - There is normal exp and Rested Exp(200%), if you log out in an Inn or in a major city(your portait up in the corner is glowing yellow), you will get more rested exp than out in the wild.  if you look at your exp bar, you will see a little Arrow marker, that is how much 200% exp you have.  Also not all lvl 5 creatues give the same exp, lvl 5 owls and lvl 5 wolves can give different amounts.<br />
<br />
3 - You most likely didnt accept it...I have only need one quest so far that has a time limit, and that was at lvl 3 in the NE starting tree.  And you can plainly see a clock on your screen letting you know how much time you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenalyn</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rarely is a timed quest found; I *think* I came across two, definitely one - in Teldrassil.  Your quest log may have been full when you tried to accept it, thus losing it... or there may have been a slit roll-back when the servers finally came up?  Can you return to the NPC and get the quest again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes you can return to NPC's and reacquire MOST quests, there are a few that you can't get a second time if you abbandon it (due to items required to get them etc), and there are very few quests you can get a second time after you've completed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Not worth it. Pitch up and down just do camara angle changes really. Hit page up all the way and you're in first person view. Hit page down once, you fall to back view, on level with your character. Hit it again, and it pivits up to normal 3/4 view style. Hit it again and it zooms out to more a wide area view. And that's it's max. I find using the mouse wheel much more useful in this aspect.<br />
<br />
2) As stated before there's only two states of XP now. There's rested and normal. Normal you get 100% of the XP from NPCs. Now do note that XP does retrograde as you level. Ie; a lvl 5 NPC will not give you the same XP at lvl 10 as it did at lvl 6. Rested XP will give you 200% of XP yeilded. It's based on XP amount, not kills made. It's also seems limited to 3 bubbles (I have yet to have more than 3 bubbles of rested XP).<br />
<br />
3) You must not have selected it or you got a bug. that's all. Quests don't time out, unless they specifically say there's a time limit (in that case you'll get a clock pop-up window at the time of selecting it).</div></div><hr />

You get about a bubble of rest bonus every 8 hours (in an inn).  Most I've gotten has been just a bit over a whole level of rest bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everyone.  It must have been that I was well rested and didn't know it, then later when it dropped to normal it seemed like a cut :)<br />
<br />
I went back to the NPC and got the quest again, so I must not have gotten it the first time.<br />
<br />
So there's no way to look up/down with the key board?  I switched out of first person for a while now because the POV is to far forward (I'm looking inside/behind mobs I'm fighting instead of at them like in EQ).  I miss EQ's first person POV - it was just right :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ's PoV view was mostly cause their 3/4 view just plain sucked. You couldn't function effectively in EQ's 3/4 view. It worked just for battles here and there, but that's just about it. Now, if EQ got it's training on 3/4 views from say Blizzard, I'm sure you would change your mind.<br />
<br />
Playing a rogue, I scout a lot, like I did with my monk. I used 3/4 view as much as I could with my monk, but when it came to manuvering, I just couldn't due to it's odd perspective (camara didn't &quot;snap back&quot; behind you causing oddness in key movements when you turn around). In WoW, I'm just stuck on 3/4 view. I will goto first person mostly in dungeons where there's not much room to overview, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />

I now pretty much only go to FPPoV when i'm sight seeing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saucon21</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a Question not sure if i will even get a Answer but here it is <br />
<br />
Where will Druids rank when the game releases in terms of tanking. Will it be at the same level as a pally or better, or even a little lower, basically i guess it would be more of a guess :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The devs have stated they want groups to be able to have a warrior, druid or paladin for tank... so I imagine in theory all three would be somewhat equal in tanking ability... maybe. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pally, currently, isn't much of a tank.  We just can't keep multiple targets on ourselves.  Even a single target can be a challenge.<br />
<br />
The Devs have stated they are aware of this problem and are attempting to give Pallies more tanking ability, w/o just giving us taunt.  Not sure how they are going to pull it off.<br />
<br />
Druids, theoretically, can taunt better than pallies currently...but a druid who builds himself so he can tank effectively is going to be wanting for groups.  People get druids to heal =\  Like any MMO...groups want classes for specific roles.  Perhaps the only exception to this, atm, is the Paladin...who is the closest thing to a useful jack of all trades, I've seen in an MMO (with the exception of bards...who have been broken either for good or ill since EQ came out =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty lucky with my guild, they'll take a druid for just about any role, need a second tank, bring in a druid, need a second healer, bring in a druid (if you can't find another priest :p)... I have seen what Aidon's talking about though, how a LOT of groups want druids to just be healers, and i've found that that's mostly because a lot of people don't know a think about any class but their own beyond the cookie cutter expectations they have for other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saucon21</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is another Question<br />
To my understanding Beta was only for USa and Canada the one runnning now not the Eurp one, But i have seen a decent about of people from Other  places granted Blizzard could of personal invited them for a reason to test Lag and stuff like that. Question is was it Just Canada and US that were suppose to be testing this one? :boohoo:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are people from all over testing it.  I know three folks, for example, living in australia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saucon21</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is Yet another Question<br />
Isthere anymore forms that are known, i think i heard rumors long Ago of a Ancient form</div></div><hr />
