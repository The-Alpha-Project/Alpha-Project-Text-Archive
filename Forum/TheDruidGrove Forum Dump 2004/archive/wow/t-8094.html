<br />
For me, it's the Son of Arugal... a level 23-24 Elite shaman NPC in the SilverPine forest area.  He has a huge agro radius and can kill most 11-13 players (who are hunting in that area) in mere seconds...  he officially has made My List (tm) ;)<br />
<br />
Any others that people have run across?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">THere's this level 13 (I think) elemental in the NE area, it's been a while so I've forgotten his name, but he hangs out in a cave with at least one or two adds.  I took him on as a lark at level 10ish, and was very surprised to find that his health went down like 5% after I unloaded all my mana on him with my druid.  Needless to say... I ran.</div></div><hr />

I made an undead warrior during the first stress test, and I swear he was stalking me!  Snuck up and killed me like 5 times in one day, all in different locations in the zone.  The last time, a friend and I were way up by Skitterling Dark, and I even saw him roaming near there!  Fortunately he didn't aggro that time.<br />
<br />
From playing night elf, I want to go back and kill Sethir, the satyr thing on the northern tip of Teldrassil... I came across him by accident, and he summoned up 5 friends or so and quickly killed me. :P</div></div><hr />

I got killed by Son of Arugal, so I made a mental note to avoid that part of the woods.  Then I got killed by him again quite a ways away from the first place, then yet again in a totally different place.  He sure gets around.  The only time I've seen him and lived was when he was busy killing another player and I managed to run off :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I had never heard of this guy until I read this thread.  I went home that night and got killed by him twice!! :cry:</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, I remember Mor'Ladim. I actually got my revenge on him <br />
solo at 34. Took 3 minutes, a lot of root &amp; dot'ting, and 2 mana <br />
potions to kill him, but I did it. Half the people in the graveyard <br />
were standing around watching and cheering me on; I got quite <br />
a few congratulations in General chat once I dropped him.<br />
<br />
His hits for 90s every second don't do much good when he can't <br />
get in range to swing at me. :p</div></div><hr />

I died to Stitches last night and see him all the time.  Mor'Ladim got me 4 or 5 times this morning in about 2 hours.  He has a big agro radius and seems to roam a wide area :(</div></div><hr />

/em crosses him off the list<br />

I helped a guard kill Stitches one day.  I watched and waited until Stitches got clear into Darkshire.  A level 44 guard attacked him solo.  A high level priest healed the guard and buffed him.  I sent in my pet and whacked at Stitches backside with my flaming warlock sword!  I probably ended up doing ~100 damage and the pet did more than that so there :p</div></div><hr />

That's the one. Not sure if level may have anything to do with it, but I was only 20 or so. And I am 99 percent positive it was a 600+ hit. Was there helping my wife with a turtle quest.<br />

I never really hated any NPC in specific, but i was doing a southshore quest the other day, and i had to kill these footpads and theifs, and up by the camp was this like lvl 30 pvp npc, and i didn't realize it and i killed the dude, which in turn put me in pvp.  about 2 minutes later, a group of 5 lvl 40-45 orcs ran on by, but had to trample over me first :/  <br />

so i stay away from that npc now.</div></div><hr />

I could have sworn it said &quot;40&quot; not &quot;??&quot; ;)<br />

If you want to find him, just take the road into Desolace and stand there for a while.  You'll either see him or you'll get eaten by a pack of dogs that roams the area...<br />

I went back last night and soloed him. First attempt had a ghoul add at the beginning and they sent me running. Medded back up and had him solo til a spider added at the very end. Used one greater mana pot during the fight. Was a great feeling to kill him, especially with my 38 priest friend watching and calling for a nerf to druids at the end :)</div></div><hr />

Was exploring and filling in my map, all of a sudden my pet takes 2 hits and dies.  I barely turn around when I get one-hit and I go flying off into the excavations near some friendly centaurs, with a brief view of some Orcish brute with an axe before descending into the pit and exploding on impact.<br />
<br />
Thankfully I had a soulstone on, so I rez'd and dusted myself off and continued exploring... only reason I knew it was Rexxar was because the combat window said it was lol...<br />

Those packs of dogs are scary too!  At least you can avoid them hehe...</div></div><hr />
