<br />
As for the downloading, I have to say, I MUCH prefer the bittorrent distributions to the horrendous fileplanet garbage, at least i can resume my bittorrent downloads with some certainty that they WILL resume and that the file won't be corrupt when it's completed.  It's been a nightmare downloading the stress test client for my Significant Other and we've had to download it no less than 4 times (and counting, still downloading...) and due to program freezes (crappy FP client) and power flickers it's been a real pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a certain file (like, say the Sound.mpq) which keeps crashing your game, you have to completely uninstall and reinstall the game.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I'm not in the beta and don't know if thats possible.<br />
 <br />
If you are stuck with Blizzards client disregard this message.</div></div><hr />

But in the end they need to convert to a download for those that just can't figure out wtf a port is. Not that many people are just that tech savy and rightfully so. Some people have bought routers for multiple connections.. or wireless access such as &quot;Tivo, Laptops, PDA's&quot; etc.. I know .. walk around my city and I hardly ever worry about an internet connection.. so many open signals it is silly. No Security!<br />
<br />
Most people just buy a router and put it in and bam it works especially with a cable connection. Ask them to forward a port and they go &quot;a what?&quot; you mean my router has an what.. IP what? I mean.. heh they just don't know. <br />
<br />
So.. yea.. it works for massive scale but the issues with ports etc.. is going to cause many technical issues that you can't cover and will make for a messy distribution of the product.<br />
<br />
Thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />
