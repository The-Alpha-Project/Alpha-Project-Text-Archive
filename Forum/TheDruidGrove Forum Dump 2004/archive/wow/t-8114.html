<br />
Can you please tell me the level range of groups in WoW?  When I played in the stress test I only grouped with a couple of friends at most and we were all within a level or 2 of one another.  How close do the levels have to be to group with friends and everyone still get experience?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, I haven't been able to get the WoW general page to load since last night to do a search.</div></div><hr />

Last week a level 53 druid was escorting a group of characters level 28-30 thru Felwood.  Some of the kills resulted in minimal XP.  The kills that were XP appeared to follow 3 rules:<br />
1)	the mob was XP for the highest member of the party (i.e. green or above),<br />
2)	the mob was XP for the party member (i.e. green or above and the mob level was displayed)<br />
3)	the character attacked (by spell or melee) the mob.<br />
This is not an effective way to power level a character.  The XP from a mob 10+ levels above a character was in the 20 to 60 range.</div></div><hr />

That's not too bad, that's like trying to grind off non elites in a level approriate group really. If you could mass slaughter/AE slaughter, it could be effective.<br />
<br />
Also the grouping bonus is minimal, it's now displayed in the experience message (don't remember it being there before, maybe only with Cosmos?), it seems to be 4% per member, depending on how they do it. Which means it's a whole 20% with a 5 person group.. really should be 10% per member</div></div><hr />

My warlock got jumped by a Rusty Golem, same level as me, but I was low health/mana, so I ran.  The Golem chased me, but my pet was right behind him attacking him.  Eventually the pet killed him (so basically I kited him).  I only got about 10% of the normal experience from that kill compared to the other golems I had been killing at the time.<br />
<br />
Is that some anti-kiting code or something?</div></div><hr />

And if I don't damage a mob at all, I won't get any/little experience. Need to do at least one damage to tag it for me as well,and not just pet.</div></div><hr />

They don't level up like Hunter pets do.  I think I might have dropped a DoT on the Golem before I ran, so maybe that's why I got some xp, but the pet did do most of the killing. ;)</div></div><hr />
