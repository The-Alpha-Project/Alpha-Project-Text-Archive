I got a level 3 night elf druid, almost level 4.  I can't seem to find any other spells besides the ones I started with (wrath, nature's touch).  I've checked the vendors I can find around the starting town and another town nearby (can't remember name, sorry).  Are there spell vendors like in EQ?  Or are spells quested/created somehow?<br />
<br />
Is there a site that lists what spells are available to druids in WoW yet?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

You will only find these in some area's.  I won't tell you where it is, that would take away from fun of the hunt! The hint is, if you pick a darkelf druid, you can find one. You will have to search the cities/towns!<br />
<br />
Spells are not cheap when your starting out. Don't spend your money foolish if you wish to get spells the second you level.</div></div><hr />

Druid trainers have this thing for the tops of treebuildings</div></div><hr />

Oh, so there is  :bonk: <br />

I saw that sigil in there, but didn't know I could read it - I'm moving now  :elfgrin: <br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

If you have yet to meet the Harpies that cast, this will come in useful.  They were the biggest pain in my arse before level 15; right there before the big city, Darnassus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fighting casting harpies always turns into a johnson contest. My nuke is bigger than your nuke! Once you learn that, they are so simple to kill. I didn't even run upto them anymore. I just wait for the right time, Moonfire and then nuke it down!<br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting Skinning/Leather crafting so you can make armor for yourself. It's also a good way to double your income just on NPCs. You can make items that sell for double what you bought the material for originally.  Of course, you do need to have the gathered materials as well.<br />
<br />
Don't bother with first aid, save up the linens for clothers that will spend almost anything for good stacks of them. First aid isn't much use with all the food avaliable in game on top of your own spells.<br />
<br />
Other than that, learn your spells, know what they can (and can't) do. Learn the strengths of your forms (for example, bear form gave my lvl 22 druid over 150 more HPs, which made it idea for fleeing fights or doing toe to toe tank fights. Cat form grants stealth abilities which makes it ideal for scouting.).</div></div><hr />

If you're BETA Alliance, bring the mats and I could do it. (when I'm back on ofc, will post my Priest's name when I get her created)  There are way too many Leathercrafters as is, it's far from being profitable.  Skinning on the otherhand is a good skill, as is Herbalism &amp; Alchemy.  Personally, with regards to tradeskills, gathering skills are the way to go for income.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the upcoming limitations on tradeskills...it will behoove  regular groups of players to plan their tradeskills amongst themselves.  Barring a specific tradeskill role, I would have to say herbalism and alchemy as the best bet for tradeskilling, since the best gear are still drops, and there is always a use for mana/hp pots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was planning to go Herbalism/Alchemy on release, but now I'm thinking for at least a while going Herbalism/Skinning until I have some money banked for all those spells.  Later I can drop Skinning and pick up Alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormrage</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm waiting for the open beta, but I would personally go with herb/alch or herb/enchanting.<br />
<br />
By the way, has anyone here tried enchanting?  I wanna know if it's good or not.  I dunno, setting your weapon on fire or something sounds cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enchanting is quite good, though not an enchanter myself, one of my guildmates has put a Fire enchantment on one of my weapons, adding a 40 fire damage proc that seems to hit an awful lot.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are also making good money on enchanting from what I understand, though it apparently costs a lot to get to a high level of skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-19-2004, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enchanting is alot like the EQ jewelery crafter.  It cost alot to gain skill, but its the most profitable tradeskill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, with all the mid to high lvl players...they way to make cash is to pick up enchanting, so you can disechant all the green/blue items you get and dont use, then sell the stuff to enchanters.   Not sure how well you can make at the release when everyone is lower lvl though.<br />
<br />
I plan on having an alt with enchanting and just mail all my green/blue stuff just for this, unless I think the item will bring something on the auction house</div></div><hr />
