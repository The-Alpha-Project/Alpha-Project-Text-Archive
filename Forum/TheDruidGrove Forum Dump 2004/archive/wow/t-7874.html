<br />
The team is looking at ways to improve the Druid. They would like to make Druid forms as unique as possible while still utilizing the Warrior/Rogue model as a starting foundation. This does not mean that they will be trying to make Druid's a weaker, watered down version of the Warrior/Rogue but instead make them unique with their own special abilities to make them a desirable solo class and/or addition to groups.<br />
<br />
There seems to be some confusion over what was stated regarding Druids last week. The changes mentioned are planned and in progress, but will most likely not be available for the next patch. Your patience is appreciated as we continue through the Beta Test.<br />
