<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious to know what everyone thinks of the druid class in WoW.  My druid in beta is only level 20, so I'm not that far in yet, but so far I haven't seen enough to make me stick with the class come release time.  Sure, we can solo fairly well, but the class doesn't seem that &quot;fun&quot; to play.<br />
<br />
The thing that bothers me the most is that we don't seem to have a clearly defined role in the game.  Similar to EQ, we are not the master of any one area - in bear form we can tank, but not as well as other classes.  In cat form we can dish out DPS, but not as well as other classes and in druid form we can heal/nuke, but again not as well as others.  Does it get better or worse at high levels?<br />
<br />
I've played all classes except Warrior and Priest in beta and so far I don't really have a favorite, but I'm pretty sure druid won't end up being my favorite.  I love the Rogue, Hunter and Warlock classes, but Paladin and Mage aren't bad either.<br />
<br />
I hope they allow 6 or 8 chars per server because I plan to play several, just haven't decided on a main yet :)</div></div><hr />

I have become so profiecent in my newbie NE quests hehe, I can get to Darkshore in about 3-4 hours at lvl 10.  If the newbie zone isnt that bad, I can get lvl 5 and out of the Tree section before my first cast of Mark of the Wild wears off.</div></div><hr />

Playing the druid, it felt &quot;almost&quot;. I never 'clicked' into it I guess. There are no huge deficits with the class, but a lot of little things that added up that made me feel like it needs to be re-evaluated and tweeked.</div></div><hr />

I will NEVER play a Priest or any other type of &quot;healer&quot; in an Online game though.  EQ was enough.  I know that priests in other games are nowhere near as bad as those in EQ but I simply don't care.  Never again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive played several other classes too high level and finally decided on druid (course hes not high level yet).<br />
<br />
One thing that druids are top notch at is healing. Preists are not really ahead of us in the healing department, we are pretty much dead even, which I found suprising.<br />
<br />
Preist Renew (Top Level)<br />
Heals 810 over 15 seconds<br />
365 Mana<br />
Healing Per Second: 54<br />
Mana Per HP: 2.2<br />
<br />
Druid Rejuvinate (Top Level)<br />
Heals 756 over 12 seconds<br />
335 Mana<br />
Healing Per Second: 63<br />
Mana Per HP: 2.3<br />
<br />
Our regeneration line of spells is both more mana efficent and heals for more in a shorter amount of time.<br />
<br />
Priest Greater Heal (Top Level)<br />
Heals 2674<br />
960 Mana<br />
4 Second Cast<br />
Healing Per Second: 668<br />
Mana Per HP: 2.8<br />
<br />
Druid Healing Touch (Top Level)<br />
Heals 2230<br />
790 Mana<br />
3.5 Second Cast<br />
Healing Per Second: 637<br />
Mana Per HP: 2.8<br />
<br />
Our biggest heals are tied with mana efficency to a priest, however their heal heals for roughly 30 more HP per second, which is rather small. The big difference (for PvP anyway), is that often times the shorter casting time spell is better, the more you get hit the longer the cast time of your spell and the more chance of interuption. Often the extra 0.5 casting time on the preists heal can turn into 1.5-2 additional seconds when being hit. Additionally that 0.5 seconds extra may be just too much for the tank to hold on for.<br />
<br />
Edit: Interestingly if you are spamming the big heal spells back to back, since the druids is faster casting, the difference in healing power becomes NULL, the preist coming ahead by only 8 hp per cast.<br />
<br />
Bear form vs Warriors is a bit off at the moment, but thats because of an AC issue with leather armor, I expect that blizzard will bring us more in line with warriors tank wise, and I think you would be suprised. Likewise cat form needs a Direct Damage finisher move in order to fill the DPS role like a rogue does. So just a small few changes and we are a really rockin class.<br />
<br />
Druids are also extremely good at PvP. I love the fact that we can Stealth and move around, one of the only 2 classes that can travel invisible.</div></div><hr />

Just be a druid and use cat form a lot and you will have many similar abilities as the rogue, and you get to move faster then a rogue while stealthed, you look cool because your a kitty! and of course you can heal and buff yourself when needed =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until some of the recent changes my plan was dwarven priest main on release with possibly a tauren shaman alt on another server.  The main factor in both choices being that I considered them both more late game friendly(instance and raid) then the druid.  Even though I think the druid is marginally more fun to play than the priest.<br />
<br />
A couple things have thrown me for a loop...  racial traits for one.  Priests don't seem to really gain anything from being a dwarf, although that would make me extremely unique I guess if I stuck with it.  Second, druids got a res.  That potentially gives them enough of an edge for me to reconsider them as one of my two most played characters.  :)<br />
<br />
I'm *leaning* towards sticking to my guns with the dwarven priest, but playing a tauren druid alt instead of shaman.  But I might also go with night elf druid and tauren shaman.</div></div><hr />

While I will be going druid at release, I can understand the hesitation for making the plunge.  I have fears of the WoW druid wandering down the same path as the EQ druid, and from what I've heard from high level druids in WoW that fear is justified.  The main problem with the EQ druid is that they have no defined &quot;unique&quot; role that makes them needed in end game content, druids are fillers not must haves.  WoW seems to currently be following the same path, the druid is the fall back class when you can't get a prefered class to fill the role.<br />
<br />
Many members of the druids grove have been members for a long time and were originally druids in everquest.  The community of TDG is such that even after we stop playing druids as mains or even quit playing EQ we stay we chat and we support.  <br />
<br />
I will be going druid in WoW, as from what I've played I enjoy it.  Druids are my favorite RPG class despite their flaws, and I'm hopeing that Blizzard will be more willing to listen to the classes than Sony was.  The fallback res added last patch makes me think they may be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Odd that so many members of the &quot;druids gove&quot; who are also regulars, are deciding not to go with druids on release.<br />
I definitely don't speak for every single player out there, but I know my concerns aren't just my own.<br />
<br />
Many &quot;old hat&quot; EQ players will shy away from any class that isn't considered &quot;core&quot;.  While Blizzard is trying to keep all the classes unique and useful (granted, you can say that about any MMORPG), the fact still remains that you will always need a tank and a healer.  Everything else is fluff that makes the encounters easier.  So, the &quot;healing&quot; druids are probably eying the priests while the nukers are looking at the mages.  Some are prolly sick of the whole casting thing and looking at melee'ers.  Either way, there are lots of reasons to stay away from a class with a diluted role, especially if you're looking forward to the raid level events.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying that druids will be useless or anything, and Bliz may still surprise us, but the fact remains that EQ druids are gun shy about any class labeled &quot;jack of all trades&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well, most of the regulars played a druid in EQ for years.  For some, they liked how druids were in EQ and changing to a WoW druids leaves a sour taste in their mouth.  For others, they just want a change of pace from being the backup healer/jackofalltrades.<br />
<br />
I personally, I disliked how the druid played when I made one, so I started up my Paladin and haven't turned back since.  I'm sure I&quot;ll have a druid come live...but he won't be my main.</div></div><hr />

Was hoping i'd be able to focus on one aspect of the Druid (healing in my case, i'm sure others like nuking, or turning into lions, tigers and bears oh my) and bring the character up to par with other classes (read: PRIEST) at the expense of my other abilities. Seems like maxing the Restoration tree in it's current form is insufficient.<br />
<br />
I'd happily sacrifice bear form and cat form entirely for a bigger healing boost, i'm sure a nuker would gladly sacrifice chihuahua form and new york style pizza form for increased nuking too. Shapeshifters would gladly sacrifice healing/nuking for the ability to morph into a chicken or something.<br />
<br />
I prefer &quot;non-traditional&quot; healers like a Shaman or Druid, never been a big fan of the cleric/priest/white mage thing. Seems like if you want to heal though (gee, i've heard this before *glares at his Planes of Power box*) you're likely going to have to play a priest. Second best healer with as large a server population as WoW servers will have generally means out of luck.<br />
<br />
That said, i'm having a blast with my Troll Rogue. *grin* Where you want me go? What you want me steal?<br />
<br />
Figure I should close on a positive note though, it seems things are WELL within Blizzard's ability to tweak right now. It's not all doom and gloom, just need a little time i'm sure. :) (have to remeber that Blizzard aren't SOE) Up the numbers a little on a few healing talents, maybe add a limited rez of some kind. Biggest struggle for Druids will be getting over the public perception of being &quot;inferior&quot;, just like in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MELTDOWN</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi gents, I joined the Druids of the Grove forums a long time ago before the game even came into the first stress test.<br />
<br />
Then I had personal issues to take care of that took up 100% of my time.  Now I'm back however and am again looking for a guild.  However, I was accepted to play the stress test and open beta now and have a level 30 Paladin.  And to respond to the post let me explain my point of view.  At level 25 I dueled a 29 druid and won, was close but won.<br />
<br />
From my experiences and reading your previous posts, I would have to agree with the conclusion that a druid is a &quot;diluted&quot; role as somone said.  However!  Having a group of druids is better than most groups.  But as soon as you try and give one druid the role of healing or acting as something he/she is not your weaking that druids role in the group.<br />
<br />
I have played a druid in the 1st stress test and found that its true, they are like the jack-of-all-trades.  Having 5 jack-of-all-trades however in a group makes for one kick ass group.  If this is the druids grove, I would recommend that everyone here became a druid.  Form a  group and realize how powerful the druids together can be.</div></div><hr />

Just to address this..<br />

A druid is currently one of the strongest PvP classes in the game. I hope your point is not that a druid is weak because you beat one in a duel. <br />
<br />
Your right a druid could use some improvements, mainly to the feral forms, not to PvP, like I said, they are already one of the top classes in the game at that.</div></div><hr />

You certainly have a right to your opinion, and I respect that. However, I humbly disagree with you.<br />
<br />
First, I *do* agree that it should be nearly impossible for someone to beat a player 4+ levels above them--idealistically. <br />

I played a NE druid in closed and open beta. I dueled repeatedly with a Tauren druid friend a few days ago (me at level 20, her at level 22) and won every time. She then called me at home and challenged me to duel with her rogue and hunter (rogue at my level, hunter 3 levels above me); I also won in those encounters. My point--players will vary in how well they do with PvP. Some classes will likely do better, but I honestly think that the player behind the character makes a difference. I'm not trying to sound arrogant, although it may come across that way. I've been owned many times by people in duels, and I'm sure I will again...which makes me think that I have much to learn about PvP tactics.</div></div><hr />

Heh, heh --  I killed a character 3 times that was so high, I didn't know he was level 35 until I was told.  I'll I saw was crossbones.  A little strategy goes a long ways when you're level 19!  L35 - L19 = 16 level difference.  It can be done....this isn't EQ.</div></div><hr />

This is all true, but unfortunately, some classes just totally destroy other classes such that it takes a tremendous amount of skill/luck both to enable a victory against said class.<br />
<br />
A druid for example will own any mage his level. Spam moonfire, instant cast, no recast. The mage has low life and cannot heal, the mage will simply drop faster then what he can drop the druid. Its actually quite a funny situation since the mage is the nuke master =)<br />
<br />
Try it out if your a druid, moonfire spamming will destroy mages.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marcuz1977</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted the below in a different thread but feels that it might belong here better:<br />
<br />
I want to explore the world of warcraft, do non-exp exploring things like diving for sunken treasure chest, touring the meadows, swimming from Kalimdor to the other 2 continents, etc. As someone mentioned in earlier threads that a druid will be most suitable for exploration, which I generally agree. <br />
<br />
Why am I so concerned about the movement speed buffs? Reason is so that I can outrun the more powerful mobs while I am at lower levels. <br />
<br />
With Shaman able to move fast at only level 20 compared to a druid whicn needs to wait till lvl 30 (travel form) I can see why there are posts in here saying that a Shaman is a better druid than Druids. This is one of the druidic things which a Shaman did better than a real Druid. By the way, why is a Shaman able to morph into a wolf form? Are we getting Pallys who can morp into angels next?  :mad: <br />
<br />
And Hunters get aspect of the cheetah at lvl 20 while Druids only sprint in their cat-forms starting at lvl 26 (though is faster by 20% but only last a crappy 15 seconds). Maybe the druids should go talk to their cheetah feline friends more often. O, did I forget to mention that a human rouge can sprint at the same speed and duration at level 10! I think my house cat who sleeps 20 hours a day can sprint faster than a track and field star who trains 10 hrs a day! <br />
<br />
I appreciate :) the swimming speed boost in aqua form though... at least thats unique for now. Keeping my finger cross that Blizzard won't be adding blessing of the seal to a Priest or aspect of the penguin to a Hunter or conjure submarine to a Mage or aqua aura to a Pally, or ninja swim to a Rouge, or ghost shark to a Shaman, or summon a killer whale ride to a Warlock or last but not least, water stance to a warrior.<br />
<br />
I can understand why a druid catform can't dps as much as a rouge, or in bear form, can't tank as well as a warrior, can't heal as well as a priest and can't DOTs as well as a mage. But I don't understand why a druid isn't the best at some simple druid skills?!?!<br />
<br />
Hopefully a druid is more useful other than being the main actor role in the starting cinematics. May Blizzard hear our prayers and improve on the basic druidic skills for a druid.<br />
<br />
Amen</div></div><hr />

Although I have a spell in the game, I can't recall what it is called, but I got it at level 20 and it seemed to be some sort of ressurection spell. I haven't tried it out yet because it requires a reagent, can anyone give me info on that?</div></div><hr />
