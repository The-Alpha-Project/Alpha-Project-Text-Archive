The dev's response is, well, saddening (Post #10).<br />
<br />
If rez is the only reason you need a priest, then the PRIEST needs fixing. WoW is making the same mistakes sony did with clerics in EQ. <br />
<br />
And being a jack of all trades, master of none, doesn't work well at the end game, when people want specialists who do the things needing doing (and the game is going to be balanced vs groups of specialists, not a group of druids). Hence, the druid will always be &quot;Master of Gimp&quot;.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't it work for Druids? On top of that, why would you even need rez except for in the heat of battle? WoW completely takes away the requirement for rezes all together. You run back to your corpse and you get a free auto-rez. It seems to me that WoW made rezes as in battle spells, much like CoH. Nothing more than &quot;save the run back&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It means you have to have a rezzer in an instanced zone, at least most instanced zones, because they have respawn, and you can't get back to your corpse in those places. And well, that's where a lot of the good stuff is. Therefore, you need a priest most likely. And of course, what if your priest dies? This is GoD all over again. <br />
<br />
BTW, you didn't play a druid in EQ did you? :D Bards are wanted because they can pull great. If fading memories didn't exist, their desireability would be much less, and most certainly it was a lot less until they changed lull, making them better pullers than monks.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how the instanced zones work, so I can't comment.<br />
<br />
Bards in EQ are great.  Period.  They are not just for pulling.  Like druids in EQ, they fill in the corners of any group and frequently make the difference between succeses and failure.<br />

<br />
As for Blizzard's view on priests, they've just cranked the priests up a notch with the latest patch fleshing out their healing abilities substantially, so a priests only role won't be to rez (which agreed is damned important) it will be to heal as well.  Also from what i understand, priests aren't offensively useless either, I know when there's open beta i'll be playing just about every class i can get my hands on just to see how they handle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My 65 bard is wanted for pulling :D. Why have a monk when you can have a bard. Bards are better at it than monks now anyways hehe, and you get free mana regen and mo-betta nukes and stuff. <br />
<br />
Druids don't do any of that, aside from pot9, which you can just use a druid buff bot to get.</div></div><hr />

You're &quot;invis&quot; to NPCs as you run back to your corpse. I think &quot;none&quot; or &quot;just rare few&quot; NPCs can see you in ghost mode. While a ghost, you have faster run speed and can't see anything around you except NPCs around your corpse.<br />
<br />
Basically, from my understand of Ghost mode is you're pratically invisiable with the inability to do anything until you recover your corpse, how ever method you use (there's 3 or 4 methods).<br />
<br />
So again, why need rez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the instances will require it (those that respawn, and I guess they are in the majority). And I would bet that since you have to go through part of a dungeon to get to most of the instanced parts, that the &quot;good stuff&quot; would be in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">having someone who can rez will also be a good idea on the battlegrounds, mind you, being that person who can rez will probably make you a very appealing target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got in in phase 3, already irked...<br />
<br />
Made my Tauren Druid, did ok to level 5, could kill level 7-8 stuff...<br />
<br />
Then a quest has me killing some gnolls. Ok, I can kill gnolls.... level 6ish guys, should be no problem. <br />
<br />
Well, then they turned into a cat (like a druid can at level 20)... and proceeded to rip me to shreds, twice... That spell casting bar being reset on hits is the SUCK. LOL. <br />
<br />
The BitTorrent fiasco is bad enough, but then huge undercons at level 6?!? /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, not huge undercons, so much as the higher level you get, the less easily you can take mobs higher level than you.<br />
<br />
I noticed, right about lvl 5-6, it started getting harder, and depending on the mob type very very difficult.  My lvl 12 druid now is very very wary when taking on a lvl 13 mob.<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying the game.  So far its done a great job of making the grind seem painless.  Quests give truly significant amounts of XP and there seems to be a plethora of them.<br />
<br />
I'm somewhat dissapointed with the druid class as it seems to be a confused class.  Caster? Melee?  You can't really do both at once...you have to choose, usually before combat, if you're going to shapeshift and go melee or stay druid and cast, due to the rather high mana cost of shifting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I think its impressive that I can generally always kill a single mob my own level.  I of course don't know how that will hold up at high levels, but I already love that a lot more than the EQ method of doing things.   <br />
<br />
I'm level 12 at the moment.  I can generally take any level 12 mob solo with no difficulties at all.  I can take a level 13 mob when I'm adequately prepared(potion buffed, lead with right spells, etc) or on the flip side I can take as many as 3 mobs about 2 levels below me, although that is even harder than the solo 13 due to the inability to get a spell off.  <br />
<br />
Out of curiousity though, were you able to come back and beat that level 6 mob once you hit level 6?  If not, possibly fire off a /bug, this *is* beta and not everything is how it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to group to kill the bristleback skinners (I think they are the cat ones). They swung too fast for me to get any spell off that wasn't instant, and my damage was nothing compared to theirs. Once I got thorns however, it made a big difference ;).<br />
<br />
Now my problem is nearly continious crashing, texture.cpp line 1805, the textureptr... I logged in today, new drivers for everything, crashed 2 times in 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've had a few crash bugs, but i can get hours of play in with no problems, it's usually if i alt+tab or if another program (such as my messenger) tries to pop a window on top<br />
<br />
Now as for gameplay, i've been able to handle a lot of things without much problem, i found instead of concentrating on casting to do damage at low levels it's almost safer to bash em with your staff and heal myself regularly.<br />
<br />
Now that i'm level 10, i can solo pretty much anything, either as the bear form or casting and whacking once they get too close :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and the quests... after CoH it seems like there's almost too many!<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying it a lot.</div></div><hr />
