<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, let me start by saying i am indeed a blizzard fanboy, however, i'm not so far gone that they can do no wrong :) i got my Beta invite to the 3rd phase late Friday night/early Saturday morning.  When i saw that little header in my Opera mailbox my eyes lit up and my heart sang!  Oh, and my wife checked her mail repeatedly... can't forget that ;)<br />
<br />
Let me set this straight from the beginning, this is not going to contain any new info or nuggets about the game, it's merely my first impressions... i certainly haven't been playing long enough to have any real secrets to divulge.<br />
<br />
First off, the account creation was dead simple, beyond coming up with a password that i felt was secure enough, i finally settled on ..... wait, no, not doing that again.  After the account creation was complete i quickly grabbed the downloader which uses the beloved BitTorrent file distribution method and i began my lengthy 2.5 hour download.  Seeing as it was 2AM when i started the download, and still needed to get out of the house early enough on Saturday to pick up a new video card to replace my then texellating and failing current card, it was time to get some sleep.<br />
<br />
i know, i'm dragging this out.  Anyway, Saturday morning i was awakened by 2 cats fighting, as i am most mornings of late, i got up, did my business then went to my computer and started the install.  Now, this is the first thing i noticed, the install takes FOREVER!!!!, it was a near 20 minute install where i sat there and went over the various forums i frequent, often checking on the install progress.  When the install was complete, a blizzard drumroll/fanfare played almost as if they knew it wouldn't be the application at the top of the pile.<br />
<br />
i launched the game, it updated, restarted, relaunched... and crashed, citing my video drivers as the cause (not suprising and having encountered it before, i repeated my fix, i shut down my computer for 20 minutes and made a cup of tea).  The next time i launched the game i was greeted with the beauty that is the License Agreement, which i promptly scrolled to the bottom of and clicked accept (wait, it signs over my soul? um.... ok, i'm good with that).<br />
<br />
Character creation seemed a bit sparse, i could easily create the look i wanted in almost every aspect except the actual size of the character, though i can see others not being able to get exactly what they want.  Blizzard has stated they're going to greatly expand these options in the future but they're not a priority right now, which makes sense.  My first character was a Tauren Druid, what i plan to play as my main at launch, the intro was a bit rough, but at the time i didn't really notice... the game is beautiful, screen-shots and low-res videos just do NOT get the point across... neither does the leaked alpha which i witnessed in action at a lan party a while back... <br />
<br />
The world breathes with life and sound, water trickles, birds chirp, and players are everywhere!  Not 5 feet in front of my character stood the first quest NPC, which i attempted to move to... The world slid and whirled around me in a very uncomfortable manner... however, after adjusting the mouse-inversion and a few of the w,a,s,d control settings all was good.<br />
<br />
Now i'm going to become a bit more general, as the last thing i want this to be is a guide of any sort or a spoiler... there are quests... LOTS of quests, with in-depth stories and often excellent rewards, i could solo fairly decently in the lower levels that i played my druid, i found a party fairly easily when i wanted one, and they were all good people.<br />
It can be a bit tricky to find your quest npc's at points, finding them the first time is usually more tricky than finding them to complete your quest, though some of them move.  As my Tauren Druid there are more quests than i know what to do with and i had to revisit some of them after finishing a rather interesting bit of story (as often happens i got carried away by one thread of story and neglected the others until i was done).  XP at this stage seems to come easily and there's no feel of grinding whatsoever, more often than not, leveling catches me by suprise or i'll look at the XP bar and go woah... that much?!?!?<br />
<br />
All in all playing my Druid to level 11 (not very far into the game admittedly) has been very rewarding and fun.<br />
<br />
Now, realizing that i'm going to be playing a druid at launch, i've sort of stopped playing him at level 11, so i can save some of the &quot;magic of discovery&quot; for launch, i've created a human Rogue as my beta character for now.<br />
<br />
i thought the Tauren lands were bustling with activity... ooooh my, Elwyn forest is teeming with players and NPC's alike, it's interesting to see the difference between the two in that order, going from the undeveloped/half-developed (and at this point still stunning) surroundings of the Tauren areas to the hustle and bustle of the human lands brings two things into focus; the first, humans are by far more popular at this point of the game than Taurens; second, when the world is polished, it's a true sight to behold.  Elwyn forest has a real feel of progress to it, the feel of human incursion and ownership, while still having a lot of frontier feel to it, there's a lot of unspoiled (and very dangerous) regions to explore.<br />
<br />
Another thing i noticed right from the get-go, my Human Rogue brings down the mobs  waaaaay faster than my druid, and he seems to have a lot more finesse to him in melee combat (makes sense right).  However, with every positive there's a negative, rogue quests aren't quite as &quot;out in the open&quot; and easy to find as Druid quests, or maybe that's just the human lands, with all the close buildings etc making it harder to just spin about and watch for the little golden !'s.  i've found enough to keep me busy at this point though, it just took a bit of snooping through people's houses.<br />
<br />
Another thing this game has is incredible detail... sure the graphics are cartoony and stylized (which btw i LOVE), but there's little things, a bird soaring overhead, rabbits in the underbrush, children playing, butterflies frolicking... only downfall is you can't set fire to any of them... well, not as a rogue anyway ;)<br />
<br />
i'm playing on the PvE server at this point.  The community seems pretty great and mature in the server so far, and problem people are shut down pretty quickly which is nice.  In 3 days playing i've seen one troll (not WoW trolls, RL trolls) and he was removed from the game rather swiftly.  People have been helpful and considerate and downright friendly.  It's a deep rich world with a lot of history and character. i like it here, i think i'll stay.<br />

It sounds really nice.  I'm so looking forward to trying WoW.  I just wish humans could be druids!<br />
<br />
Not playing your druid in beta so he will be fresh for you sounds like a good plan too.  <br />
<br />
Please update us on how you are enjoying it as you go along :).</div></div><hr />

ATM, starting the same time Crimson did (or roughly so) I have a 16 druid, 14 rogue, 6 warrior, 5 warlock. I have to cycle time between them, and not play one of the 2 mains each day just so I can have more than a few kills in &quot;bonus&quot; xp. Once you hit tired, wow, the xp crawls. And this is at level 14-16. I try to do quests, and I do every one I can, and it just isn't enough. My Night Elf Rogue is out of &quot;yellow&quot; quests, and down to 3 orange and red ones. And well, even though the quests are all the same things, courier, or kill, or kill-courier, I need at least something to make me want to kill things. Mindlessly grinding large cats or bears is boring, did that in EQ for years, don't want to do it again.</div></div><hr />

There is apparently a bug this latest push with lower than normal xp rewards for a lot of quests.  Its causing everyone to experience the same &quot;running out of quests&quot; problems that you and I are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, there's also a little bug with the rest system not allowing you to rest up at the proper rates or to the proper amounts while logged out etc, it's supposed to be fixed in the next patch.<br />
<br />
I can't play as much as I'd like to (due to RL responsibilities and spending a lot of time with my wife and daughter), so my rogue is only level 12 and I'm just now seeing the rest marker on my XP bar, mind you... it's not moving up when i log off in an inn, so it looks like i'll be suffering the rest bug that so many others are very shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">King, I also heard they jacked up the xp requirements again this push hehe.<br />
<br />
I heard all this stuff about &quot;fast leveling&quot; and my druid is only 16, and I've played him quite a bit.</div></div><hr />
