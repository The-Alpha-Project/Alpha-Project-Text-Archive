<br />
In prior games of this type(EQ, DAoC, SB, etc) it seemed like mastery of your class could be attained with relative ease, especially with melee classes.  However, in this game I feel like I get better at my class and learn new nuances and ways to use my abilities every single day.  I'm feeling like I've only scratched the surface at what I can do with my warrior for example.  There are just so many interesting abilities and ways of using them in different situations that it constantly keeps me on my toes.  <br />
<br />
I've just never experience this kind of interactivy in mmog combat before.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed this?</div></div><hr />

The fluid motion and control i have over pulling off combo's or doing fancy footwork like gouging my opponent then circling behind him and stabbing him in the back for extra damage, or timing that kick to the face perfectly to counter a caster's spells.  I've never felt so involve in combat before without getting bruised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most complicated aspect of paladins is deciding when to save mana for healing/seals and which seals to drop on who when.</div></div><hr />

I do enjoy the Warrior more than EQ's warrior, but ... its still pretty simple hehe.<br />
<br />
I wish my Rogue was better, I love gouge/backstab, but... I miss half the time still. Annoying!</div></div><hr />
