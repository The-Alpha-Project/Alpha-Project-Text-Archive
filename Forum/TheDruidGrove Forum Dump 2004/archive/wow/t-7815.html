   World of Warcraft does stick to the Warcraft storyline. Remember that several years have past and things have changed in the world.   <br />
      <br />
   ---   <br />
      <br />
   In the past, women were not accepted into Druidic organizations.  Much has changed.     <br />
      <br />
   Various Druid subgroups such as Druids of the Claw, the Talon and many others existed for countless ages. This system had many problems and was eventually altered. To strengthen the order, the Archdruid, Malfurion Stormrage disbanded all of the subgroups and old orders to gather them together as one entity.   <br />
      <br />
   Under the direction of Malfurion, the Druids have adopted new policies. They now welcome women into their ranks and embrace the freedom to adopt all animal aspects for each Druid.   <br />
