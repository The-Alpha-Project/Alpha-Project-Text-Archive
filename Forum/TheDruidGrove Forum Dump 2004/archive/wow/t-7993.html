We will be taking our account-creation servers down for scheduled maintenance on Wednesday, September 29 at 7:00 AM PDT. This maintenance should last no longer than one day; however, please note that if you have not yet created a beta account with your authentication key, you will not be able to do so during this time. You will also be unable to change your password while the maintenance is occurring. Beta testers with active accounts will not be otherwise affected, nor will the beta test itself. When the account-creation servers are back online, we will post another message here letting everyone know. Thank you for your patience!<br />
