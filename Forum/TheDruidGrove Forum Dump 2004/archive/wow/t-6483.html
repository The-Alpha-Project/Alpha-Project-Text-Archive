Maybe after I played awhile I will get used to them, but right now I'm thinking I wouldn't want to play a night elf because they look like Donkeys.  Then the other Druid race are cows....  sheesh.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping they change alittle before the real game is released, but I'm dreaming.. Will it affect me from buying the game? Most likely not.

<br />
As a perfect example.. using EQ.. most people hated Helms.. quite frankly we just rather have NO artwork for helms.. unless maybe your a Troll.. now if you look.. most helm graphics have been removed on new armor sets.. thats how important it was and quite frankly it does make it easier for SoE.. since they don't have to invest money into that particular spot. Why.. because people like seeing the face of their character... they like being able to look at their character and not be hidden behind a tin can.. /shrugs thats my take on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rahjeir</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll agree with that statement Sobe. Looks are a big part of the online gaming world. I think though, if someone comes with a good gameplay it can over shadow the &quot;interesting&quot; models.<br />
<br />
Though I can tell you, when SoV game out, I would kill for some of that sweet looking druid green armor. Of course in the old SoV models. My Goal back then, was to obtain some of that armor at all cost. The cost was my sleep, didn't get much back then. hehe<br />
<br />
WoW has alot of hype to live up to. And if they give me soild gameplay, I can live with iffy models. I maybe be the only one that hates the models, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the gameplay of WoW will likely be enough to keep me playing, but the models imho are just horrible and ugly.  The ears on the elves are terrible.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness they got away from the bad helmet models in EQ.  Anarchy Online has *horrible* helmet models (true bucket heads on EVERYONE) and there is no end in sight to them...  I really dont think some of those devs realize just how important it is for people to see each others faces, even if it's only a virtual face, and to be able to customize it and make it their own, in order to really be immersed in the whole experience.  Bad models and particularly bad face/head models are a real detractor from that, for me and many many other people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just look at the identification that the players here have for the four races of Druids.  They take pride in their looks.  The way the models look is important for players. <br />
<br />
I can't hide my misgivings at the models for the Druids in WoW, honestly.  Bulls and floppy eared rabbits are going to be a hard sell, I believe.</div></div><hr />

That is the one thing I felt that SWG went a long way towards getting right.  I really enjoyed the character creation in that game.  But of course that part wasn't enough to make me play the game for long at all.  So game play and content will be the things that will either grab and hold me or make me turn back to Norrath.<br />
<br />
Still, as someone said above I'm most likely going to go with a human mage or a priest.  I enjoy being able to heal and always have played healers, just wondering how they will manage aggro in the game with the priest being able to both heal and mez.  If that's too much, then the human mage looks interesting as well.  I'll make a druid I'm sure but I don't know how much actual play time she'll get due to the look of the model.</div></div><hr />

Swg was great when it came to character creation and being able to mold your toon into  a unique look. Wow developers need to take a few lessons from them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harvey the dog</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">though i liked the tauren in the official campaign for WC3, i agree with you all.  not a good race for druids...but then, take a look at what is offered for races in WOW.  Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes and Night Elves are Alliance and Orcs, Tauren, Undead and Trolls for The Horde...<br />
<br />
first off, i think they should switch the NE's and the Tauren...the Tauren look a lot more &quot;alliance-ish&quot; IMO. hmm...racism in WOW?  hehe.<br />
<br />
but as far as the races available for druids, i don't see that Blizz has much choice if they are only going to be going with those 8 races.  forced to pick between the 2, i think i'll have to go Tauren.  of the two, they look the coolest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/screenshot.aspx?ImageIndex=130&amp;Set=1<br />
<br />
Too bad they can't be druids though.<br />
<br />
And I agree.  The night elves look terrible.  I really don't want a character who has ears like Dumbo and flashlights instead of eyes.  I guess I'll be going Tauren!</div></div><hr />

They are both very different from anything thats been available in previous MMOG's and I think there is definitely something to be said for that.</div></div><hr />

I've used that picture for my elemental savant of cold in my D&amp;D game.  Savants undergo minor transformations as they level, but seeing the in game night elves makes me retch.  The ears are WAY too big and the eyes are horrible.  If I get into the WoW beta *crosses her fingers* I', definately going to be feedbacking the night elf appearance a lot.</div></div><hr />

Actually, not all of the models are horrible looking.  Take a look at this human female model:<br />
<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/screenshot.aspx?ImageIndex=6&amp;Set=19<br />
<br />
It's very well rendered IMO.  I can see a lot of cybering going on with that look  :cool: .<br />
<br />
The Night Elves have got to be changed though.  Even if you discount the donkey ears and flashlight eyes, they still seem to have a low polygon count, which makes them look crude and blocky in appearance.  I'm with Aly on that.  If I make it into beta, Blizzard can expect a lot of negative feedback on the Night Elf models.  They might even get the message before it's too late!</div></div><hr />

One of the things that makes WoW (and most Blizzard games) unique is the fact that you can &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; the stylistic nature of the characters.  Yes, that means that more people will probably dislike the models rather than if you had plain-vanilla-non-offensive toons, but at least they have attitude and a persona.</div></div><hr />

I still get comments on my character's appearance even after the dyes came out.  While color is easy to change now... you can still look horrible in it.  It took some finagling of gear, but My rogue looks very nice in a very deep red (30 / 0 / 0), especially when using the Wood Elf illusion crown.  Chain tunic and leggings, plate vambraces, bracers, and boots.  I try to always go for rich, vibrant colors that look good.<br />
<br />
The cleric blue from skyshrine is very nice to use as well: 50 / 100 / 150 and my cleric uses a nice green that's not too pale nor too dark.  50 / 100 / 50, although I'm not sure if those are the correct numbers.  She's had that color for ages.</div></div><hr />

The red and blue were relatively rare colors on a druid at the time ~ and the green tunic wasn't the most common either (most druids of the time either wore brown leather tunics or the elysian chain).  I wouldn't say I was &quot;vain&quot; or &quot;ego-stroking&quot;, I'd just say I wasn't obsessed with stat #s as much as the next guy.</div></div><hr />

Sounds more like a trainwreck to me... ^.^  I prefer uniform color overall.  Trying to figure out a new color for my SK on FV though.  Far too many dark elves running around with the dark blue (50 / 0 / 0) color.</div></div><hr />

I think the final look my retired druid ended up with was very &quot;Dallas Cowboy'ish,&quot; not by design, but by coincidence.  A mix of very baby bluish metallic and silver.  The armor I had on looked more like Crystal Chitin than leather when made that color.  I didn't stick out, but I didn't blend in.  I liked it.<br />
<br />
I recall one of my first times ever playing a pencil and paper RPG was Shadowrun.  The group I was playing with wanted one of those huge, giant suburban juggernauts to drive around in, and the GM asked, &quot;What color?&quot; and of course, we all said, &quot;Black!&quot;  The GM sort of snorted and said, &quot;Yeah, that won't be suspicious.&quot;  I thought for a second and said, &quot;Ok, then since it's my rig, I want it forest green with beaverwood paneling on the side.&quot;  Granted... the huge 50mm cannons on the side probably destroyed that innocent look anyway.</div></div><hr />
