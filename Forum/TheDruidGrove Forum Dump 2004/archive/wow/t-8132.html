I know there was a pop up screen that wouldn't allow you to enter game without DX 9.0c and it also mentioned video drivers.  I haven't played any games for a little bit now and haven't seen anyone commenting about the new drivers.  If some of the older drivers work better than the newer ones or if the game requires you to have the newest I'd appreciate the information.  Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />

I used to run the 47.0 series drivers due to problems with the early forceware, but they seem to have those all straightened out and i'm getting a good 10 more fps with the forceware drivers.  The game doesn't require you to have the latest, just the first set with DX 9.0c capability, but you're safe grabbing the latest.</div></div><hr />

However to contradict that my Newer PC worked fine with the Latest Drivers.  So unless its changed in the last week its a bit hit an miss..try older or newer drivers...some may work.<br />

The latest WHQL you can get are 66.93. I used the 66.29 (guru3d's benchmarks showed these as scoring the best) during beta and had no problems.</div></div><hr />

I can't speak for performance differences--if there are any they can't be more than a couple fps, but I have noticed several glitches from the previous official drivers went away.<br />

About friggin time they updated, the last set of official Forceware drivers dated back to *JULY*! Used to be that it was Nvidia that had a new driver every month and ATI that struggled with updates.</div></div><hr />

They do make a different in performance of your system in general. The best way to figure out your chipset is to use a problem like WCPUID (http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002374/src/download.html).</div></div><hr />

Nvidia has released more then a dozen drivers since July including 2 windows certified in October.</div></div><hr />
