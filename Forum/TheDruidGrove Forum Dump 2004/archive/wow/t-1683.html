Sounds very entertaining.  I must admit, the LAST thing I thought I'd ever read from Furor were the words &quot;Druid&quot; and &quot;bad a$$&quot; in the same sentence.  <br />
<br />
I think Furor is probably making a calculated move here as well (this may be obvious).  He's pretty ticked off at SOE and I'm sure they're well aware of the volume of EQ traffic (read: potential WoW player base) that visits FoH.  They can't be thrilled that he essentially wrote a glowing review for their nearest competitor.  Expect to see SOE kick the &quot;we love the player base&quot; campaign into high gear now.<br />
<br />
Question is: is it too little too late?<br />

As for me, I'm taking a wait and see attitude.  I'm figuring that for $21 I'll get a subscription and try EQ2 out, but if EQ1 continues to feature nerfs and content that is difficult to enjoy as a casual player, or EQ2 features more of the same, then I suspect I'll switch to another product thats better suited for casual play.<br />
<br />
Having read Furor's review, and the press at Blizzard's site, I am cautiously optimistic.  Fewer classes means class balancing will be simpler, the ability to add secondary skills that mean something to add more differentiation/flexibility/utility is also a major win.  Quest mobs that, when defeated, place the quest component in the inventory of each person doing the quest is also a huge plus.  And thats just the tip of the iceberg.</div></div><hr />

Amazing. The graphics are more precise, colorful and just a tad cartoonish. It almost seems a mix of DAoC, AC2 and EQ.<br />
<br />
The quests reminded me of AC2, the trades were sort of AC2 also but not all the click stuff. Combat appears to be much like EQ's combat. There were other things that had a blurred likeness to parts of these games.<br />
<br />
Not sure that I want to get into another EQ knockoff even if the character models are about 100 percent better. DAoC and AC2 both sounded wonderful till I started playing them. They were horridly boring after a week. SWG does sound like it would keep my interest and be a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I specifically like not having PVP in EQ.  I have been watching for WoW with some interest since I think it has a lot of appeal, but I doubt in my heart that any nifty graphics or freshness could overcome the essential fact that I despise PVP.<br />
<br />
Will definitely check it out when it is released though.</div></div><hr />

Yes the basics can, but to say that this game resolves all the issues previous games have tends to make me pull back from the review and think &quot;Is Furor on their payroll now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Many people don't even know what the high end game of EQ is like becuase it changes so much from how the game starts, even if a GM came up to a mid to low level character and pumped them up to 65 and outfitted them in the best gear they still would have no idea what they were in for.<br />

I'm going to be getting one of those All Access subscriptions so I can play PS + EQ1 for 22 bucks a month (quite the deal, imo) and then when EQ2 comes out, I can play it for &quot;free&quot;, after buying the initial box of course =).<br />

In the same way Doom 3 will make WoW's graphics look like stickfigures (very nice stickfigures mind you!) when it comes out but the graphics are compelling enough that you can still play a good game with them.  From what I'm hearing about WoW, thats what it's going to be, a good game!  Not some carpel tunnel syndrome, tedious, gamble/greedfest for the masochistic that is EQ with it's endless XP grinds, spawn camping and loot whoreing.<br />
 <br />
  For too long EQ has been little more than an IRC channel with colors for me.  Sticking an extra 20hp and mana on items just isn't enough to make me want to spend time upgrading my 20+ inventory slots yet again.  No exploration, no fun in combat just tedious grindage, and worst of all what EQ gets it's name from, questing, is just, just plain sad.  Stick a fork in it, it's done.</div></div><hr />

Diablo, etc is a SPS (ie, Second Person Shooter).<br />
<br />
As excited as I am for WoW, I think EQ will live on.  I plan on playing EQ, if only recreationally, for a long while still.  Even if some other game comes and steals my heart~  Right now, that game doesn't appear to be SW:G (looks stupid) or EQ2 (looks stupid).  WoW is the only game that's come along that makes me say, &quot;wow, that game looks more fun that EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, the graphics are sort of cartoonish .. but.. really - its a video game.  I don't like my graphics too REAL.  I like to differentiate fantasy from reality, if on only a superficial level when I'm drunk!  If the game contains as much content as Everquest, I'll probably be likely to play it.<br />
<br />
It will be hard, however, to be as devoted to a video game as I was to Everquest during the first few years...  The sense of exploration and newness to the game (Everquest) lasted so long.  I think it only finally died off during Velious...</div></div><hr />

Its still kicking after how many years now, but its nothing special. That's EQ's near future and its only THEIR fault.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's not familiarity with EQ that is the issue.  It's familiarity with WoW.<br />
<br />
I'm sure many, if not most, of us have hundreds of days played in EQ.   Moreover, the amount of time played does not necessarily translate to familiarity with all aspects of the game.  Regardless, the elements/characteristics of EQ should be familiar to most players who have spent less than several hundred days played.   <br />
<br />
The problem is that Furor and the rest of us do not have many hours of playing a finished product.  Many of the changes he describes actually already exist in other games, such as AO and DAOC.  My experience has been that while these address some of the EQ problems mentioned, they don't do so to the extent we all would hope.<br />
<br />
Furor's fanboi enthusiasm is good to see, but I don't put that much stock in it.</div></div><hr />

I played Anarchy Online for awhile and one really cool thing that I liked about it is that it set up zone instances. What that basically means is that If I walked over a zoneline with my group and somebody else walked over the same zoneline with their group - we would be in the same dungeon - but 2 instances of the same dungeon - the dungeon was in a sense duplicated to allow each group their own experience. WoW plans to incorporate this too. You can check THAT out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blizzard.com/wow/faq/faq_gameplay.shtml&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My RL friends play Diablo II. They said on April 1, after tracking all players for over a year, Blizzard deleted all characters on the accounts of people who were undoubtedly hacking. They nullified the CD codes for those people too, so the CDs can no longer be used to play D2 online.<br />
<br />
The next D2 patch is coming soon too, and they plan to do another character wipe of cheaters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sony vs Blizzard..  humm lets see..<br />
<br />
I have been waiting for WoW since it was first hinted at.  If I am going to pay to play a MMORPG, I want one with depth, technical support and a dependable policy of giving players their money's worth.   Sony vs Blizzard...   from what I have seen from sony for the last 5 years it is little contest. <br />
<br />
The premise is team vs team  (orc, human and elf I believe) with 3 teams.  Each race will have unigue skills and progressions with each class able to branch out.  <br />
<br />
The reduction of base classes with skill tree developement is what Shadowbane uses. It allowes each player to custom design their caracter as a unigue individual.  In EQ every lv x druid is identical in skill to every other lv x druid except for minor gear differences.  <br />
<br />
In case someone doesnt know how that works.   You have various races and 4 base classes Fighter, rogue, healer, mage. Once you get to lv 10 you have to select among with a dozen or so professions before you progress further.   So a rogue can be a theif, scout or assassin at lv 10.  But wait... A mage can be a Warlock, Wizzard or Assassin...   Humm so you can be a stealty assassin or a caster assassin.   And that stealty assassin can specialize in bow, dagger or sword... Or the wizzy assassin can specialize in staff or dagger (or if elf sword).   Then you can also quest for runes so you can memorize to access up to 3 Diciplines (specilized skill trainers) that give you limited skills that enhance yours or give you skills other classes have (track, heal, weapons).    So you could have a mage assassin with a pet, tracking and charm. Or a Warrior with Fear, heal and group buffs.   By the points you invest each level you decide if you will be more defensive, offensive, melee, caster, pet class or healer. <br />
<br />
Confused?? Basically you make decisions throughout your toons life as to what his ablilities are, making him more unique to you..   That would be like EQ, each spell level letting you select some but not all spells for your class but sharing more spells. <br />
<br />
WoW will start with probably 3 classes War, mage, priest and then let you progress along a skill tree, specializing along it based on your race till the character is more unique than in EQ but less than in SB.  I did not see any theif class but may have missed it.</div></div><hr />

Moot for me...I hate PVP.  Being able to play it without isn't the same as it being a non-PVP game.<br />

/shrug I will pick it up and try it out, but my gut is that it will not really draw me in. <br />

I look at this as an &quot;opposite&quot; of what makes EQ -- EQ.. but at the same time even EQ has a version of PvP type servers that deal with different sides. Its not for everyone.. but I will sure give it a go.. since I reallllly like the way they have developed the classes so far. Who knows it maybe fun.. and quite possibly a server of this category will be developed or is in the works, lets only hope!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoak</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is, it is what is true for MOST servers that will define the game from the ground up.<br />
<br />
I am not sure that most PVP'ers feel that partitioning off a few servers of EQ as PVP really made EQ an effective PVP game.  And the consequences for all the other servers as they devs have to balance for PVP are very sweeping.  What you do to keep druids balanced in PVP also affects what you can do in non-PVP.<br />
<br />
My gut is that they will deliver a DAOC style endgame for WOW, and allow a few servers where it doesn't work that way.  Where players migrate is an open question, but if their vision for the end game is all about the PVP, there won't be much to keep the non PVP player's interest.<br />

I pretty much vowed never to play PVP games again after my stint with UO back in 1997.  The tedious griefing and the game experience it forced on you (every person you ever see is a potential - a probable - threat...did nothing for my immersion in  the MMOG).  <br />
<br />
At the time I was playing UO, there was some exploit where you could charm a wyvern or dragon and lead it into town, lose control of it at the vault biulding and completely wipe out 40 players.  And people did it.  You could loot players gear when that happened..I was constantly remaking my newb gear and it wasn't any fun for me.<br />
<br />
PVP invites really childish people to play the game since it feeds the need they have for some sort of power they probably don't enjoy IRL.  I just think it brings out he worst in people.<br />
<br />
I will still try WOW, but my gut is I will think &quot;hmm pretty but this really really sucks&quot; and give it a pass.</div></div><hr />

Since there is no goal aside from &quot;kill everyone&quot;, it becomes mundane and boring quick. Capturing places? Well they'll either be recapture the next night, or it'll become so one sided that you will never be able to take them back (see DAOC and Shadowbane).<br />
<br />
And heaven forbid you want to PvE in a PvP spot. Haha. Wheee. What fun.</div></div><hr />
