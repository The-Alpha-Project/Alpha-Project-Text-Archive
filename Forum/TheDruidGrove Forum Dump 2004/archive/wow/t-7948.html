I really hate this idea has I have invested a lot of personal time (grinding for skill-points, collecting mats) into my chosen crafts.  Currently my Druid has 2 Artisan Skills (269 Leatherwork + 2 Specs &amp; 300 SKinning) and 4 Experts (225 Enchanting, Alchemy, Engineering and 183 Herbalism).  My husband is fine as he only has Artisan Blacksmithing (285), Artisan Mining and what will be considered a secondary skill in the future, First Aid.  I don't know what to unlearn in preparation of the next patch (No ETA), but I don't like the idea of having to chose or have selected at random (they propose if you have more than 2 professions, they will leave 2 and randomly unlearn the excess for you).  I suppose getting rid of Leather and Skinning will be fine as I don't often utilize those skills but if they improve it I will be upset, the same will hold true if they improve items crafted by Engineering.</div></div><hr />

We're lazy =P  <br />
<br />
Second, it only makes sense, with unlimited skill points (which are a good thing), you need to limit primary tradeskills else after a year everyone in a guild will be maxxed in every tradeskill.<br />
<br />
Everyone shouldn't be able to make their own armor and weapons, enchant them, and be able to make their own potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the news post from WoW's Official Beta Site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com)<br />
<br />
<br />
In the next patch (no ETA as of yet), most trade skills are being renamed to &quot;professions,&quot; and the way in which players acquire and learn them is changing. You will no longer learn different professions by paying for them with skill points. You'll still learn them by speaking to the appropriate profession trainer. However, players will now be restricted to learning two professions. We decided to change the skill system to make it simpler, balanced, and more intuitive. The new system should allow everyone to participate in one to two professions, and create a much more vibrant market for goods generated from professions. <br />
<br />
We strongly encourage players to choose the two professions (trade skills) they wish to keep before the patch goes live so as to avoid the possibility of losing a hard-earned profession. If you have more than two trade skills known on your character, two will be chosen randomly to be retained as professions. The others will be eliminated from your character. Please unlearn the skills you do not wish to keep, and make sure that you only have two trade skills left on your character. To unlearn a trade skill, open your Skills window by pressing the hotkey ?K.? Select the skill you wish to unlearn and click the Unlearn button that appears to the right of the skill. <br />
<br />
The professions are: alchemy, blacksmithing, enchanting, engineering, herbalism, mining, leatherworking, skinning, and tailoring. <br />
<br />
The secondary skills are: cooking, fishing, and first aid. <br />
<br />
Several old trade skills are being turned into secondary skills. These do not count toward your two-profession limit, so players can learn all three secondary skills, in addition to their two professions, without restriction. The survival skill is being removed and campfires have been folded into the cooking profession. <br />
<br />
No More Skill Points <br />
<br />
With the changes to trade skills, skill points (SP) will be removed from the game, and currency will be used instead to train skills formerly based on SP. <br />
<br />
Mount trainers will now require you to have a certain level of reputation with their respective city in order to acquire a mount.<br />
<br />
It looks like the winds of change are blowing on some aspects of WoW, and though the change doesn't really effect any of my characters as far as losing skills... I'm a bit concerned about training in new weapons and such... With SP gone... what will we use?  Money?  Say hello to Twink City...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenalyn</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the lack of a link, but I'm lazy too. *lol*  I'm a tradeskill junkie - always have and always will in a variety of games I have played.  I don't want to revert to the old EQ tactic of having X mules each with their own mastered tradeskill.  If this change is to help balance the economy and the number of crafters I highly doubt we'll be able to have our set of level 10 twinks wandering the world as our craft masters.  If so, people like me will obviously take advantage of this and may even purchase an additional account (as did in EQ).<br />
<br />
How will this  be implemented?  Will we have to quest for future specializations (i.e. Artisan Engineers quest for Gnomish OR Goblin Engineering and not both where as Leatherworkers simply trained Dragonscale, Tribal or Elemental with skill-points and a couple silver)?  Will items be revamped to express the new limits such as Engineering items like bombs be useable by all rather than profession only?  Will crafted &quot;bind on pick-up&quot; items be changed to &quot;bind on equip&quot; or have the tags removed all together?  Will some devices such as Goblin Jumper Cables become more effective since the number of Engineers may possibly dwindle? (I'm debating the removal of this skill because of the lack of success with said item for my Druid and find it easier to just pack a Paladin in my purse)<br />
<br />
*long, drawn-out sigh*<br />
<br />
I truly enjoy being able to fiddle with a lot of crafts, after all I'm a Druid... &quot;Jack of all, Master of none&quot; (Obviously I'm not Artisan with all or I'd really have no life)  So far, it looks like I will keep Enchanting and Alchemy as they have been the most costly of my skills to raise.  I will definitely pick-up the &quot;free&quot; secondary skills lol  Hopefully those can fill my soon to be void lol</div></div><hr />

It never will &quot;work&quot;, so why bother with it. Trade channel is all you need. Someone have an item you want? Buy it. Don't try to &quot;balance&quot; the economy by having &quot;interdependance&quot;. That just means mules. Sheesh, you'd think they'd have learned something from EQ about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that having everyone in the game able to have all the gathering skills was in need of adjustment, but there were much better ways to accomplish this without destroying some of the longevity of playing a specific character.  That was one of my end game goals, grinding for skill points and mastering multiple trades.  The trades are one of my favorite elements in WoW and I really don't want to have to make multiple mules in order to take advantage of that.<br />
<br />
(As a direct response to what you said Aidon, I disagree.  :)  Skill points/trades were the closest thing to an EQ AA equivalent that WoW had to help prolong having a &quot;Maxed&quot; character.  Its going to be far far easier to reach that point now, unfortunately.  Now, if they do something really fantastic with the hero class system like forcing a restart at level 1 in the new class, then I'll still be happy...but I just don't expect anything that extreme to come into play with their hero system)</div></div><hr />
