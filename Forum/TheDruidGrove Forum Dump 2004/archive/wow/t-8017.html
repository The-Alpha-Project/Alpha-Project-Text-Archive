I know that game is heavily reliant on what template your character has built for themselves.. <br />
I know also that WoW has different templates with the talent points and all. .Is there a Flavor of the month template out that that seems to be working for the druids in beta? Or is there any skills that are a Must?<br />
<br />
I look forward to your feedback</div></div><hr />

Of course, once the talents have been in for a while someone will find the best builds for each playtype, until then, i'm enjoying the variety.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can have unlimited weapon and secondary skills, so untraining them isn't necessary (or possible).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now in beta, you can talk to a talent guy and he resets them all to 0 for you...but thats for only beta, they have yet to say how it will work after release.  My guess its going to be another money sink for each point you want to reassign.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for builds...its basically what ever you want todo, I know some druids that are going all for shapeshifting skills, others going for all healing stuff.  I am going with the nature damage stuff with a little bit of healing, no shapeshifing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've seen and read so far (my druid is only 17, so I don't have personal experience with this much yet :)) is that you can basically pick one of the three trees (shapeshifting, damage, healing) and if you max out one, the others will suffer.<br />
<br />
As far as which one is best, well that seems to depend on who you ask :)<br />
<br />
Since I solo mostly (and did in EQ as well) I'll probably go with the damage line first, then if I don't like it for some reason, and I can untrain it, I may go to shapeshifting since it's fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan on maxing out the damage line..but there are a few &quot;must have&quot; in the restoration, specially if you are a soloer.<br />
<br />
Upgrade to Mark of Wild for 5 points, then getting 5 points into &quot;Nature's Focus&quot;.  The 60% chance of not getting interupted by damage while casting your heals is crucial, specially while soloing, makes it ALOT easier.<br />
<br />
I am looking at a template with 35 points into Balace and 16 into Restoration</div></div><hr />
