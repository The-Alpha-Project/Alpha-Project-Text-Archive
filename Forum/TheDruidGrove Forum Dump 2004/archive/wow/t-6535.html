<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been trying to sign up for the beta of WoW and get as far as the Active X screen and it keeps saying my computer security won't allow it.  I've gone into the tools bar and custom area of security and enabled it and it is still not allowing access.  <br />
<br />
Since time is running out I'm asking for help please.  I've tried a few times and even checked the faq part of one of the free virus scans someone posted in another thread about Active X to be sure I was enabling the correct areas.  I have the settings right according to that site...although it won't run that scan either due to Active X.<br />
<br />
Sorry to say I'm one of those that you must speak slowly to about comps, blush, but would really appreciate any ideas you may have about what I need to do to take care of this.  Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you could add blizzard.com to your trusted sites list.<br />
<br />
If neither work, it could be some other firewall on your system blocking it, like ZoneAlarm or Norton Internet Security.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:  Ok that took care of it, many thanks again :).</div></div><hr />
