<br />
Asking a Druid in the World of Warcraft for a port will more than likely get one maimed; likewise for those that wish for a cast of ye olde’ Spirit of Wolf. Expect former Everquest Druids turned World of Warcraft Druids to shapeshift into a Bear and maul you to death for such insolence. Just remember this, you have been warned. <br />
<br />
The Druid of World of Warcraft was designed as a ‘Jack of All Trades’ type of character – yet master of none. Key abilities of the Druid include the ability to Shapeshift into various animal forms, some formidable in their own right, others as innocuous critters and beasties, best used for scouting and possibly ambush of the enemy. Along with the power of the Druid to Shapeshift comes a full spellbook. At its core, the druid is a powerful healer (when not in animal form).<br />
<br />
Shapeshifter<br />
<br />
Currently the Druid has the ability to Shapeshift into two forms: Bear and Cat.<br />
<br />
As a Bear, the Druid becomes a Warrior. While not having anywhere near the abilities of a pure Warrior, the Druid in Bearform is granted a Rage bar and some of the key abilities available to the pure Warrior. It has to be noted that while in this form, the Druid cannot cast spells. Do not be fooled, however, into thinking a Shapeshifted Druid in Bear form will not make a formidable tank. With the loss of their spellcasting power, they make tangible gains in the ability to take and dish out some damage.<br />
<br />
As a Cat, the Druid takes on the abilities of the Rogue. Key to these abilities is the ability to Stealth and Scout. Some of the damage dealing capabilities of the Rogue may also be granted to the Druid in Cat form. <br />
<br />
Spellcasting Druid<br />
<br />
When the Druid is not in the form of an animal, they gain the ability to cast spells. A Druid makes for a powerful healer and has the ability to also dish out some damage via nukes. Also granted to the Druid in Druid form is the ability to cast an outdoor Root (Tangling Roots), to stop their enemy in their tracks, immobilizing them outright. Again, the drawback to being a Jack-of-All-Trades is that the Druid gives up many of the instant cast heals and more powerful Area of Effect Heals the Priest class has available for use.<br />
<br />
The name of the game for the World of Warcraft Druid is versatility. This versatility will guarantee a spot for the Druid in any adventuring party.<br />
<br />
Note: While only two of the Druid’s Shapeshifting classes have been listed in this update, I was ASSURED that there will definitely be more forms that the Druid will be able to take later in their life. Some of these forms may augment the Druid’s ability to swim and others may be used in PvP warfare *GRIN*.<br />
<br />
Additional Notes: &quot;The Druid in caster form will be balanced to compete with the healing capabilities of the Priest. While he will not have the same versatility in healing, his raw healing output will be similar. Groups ideally will be equally happy having either a Priest or Druid in the group for healing.&quot; (R. Pardo)<br />
Thanks Furor for the updates!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balise</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I have been reading the WoW group combating system seems to take focus away from healing and shift it more towards doing damage and controling the situation.  With the druid/priest/palladin healing available and each able to keep a whole group up in some way I expect the fighting to concern more with DPS with a side order of crowd management.<br />
<br />
I am really liking how they put some unique abilities for each class that will make them fun to play.  Although the druid looks like a class I would play I think the Palladin, Priest, and Warlock are three classes that I will also try and have equal chance of playing as my main.<br />
<br />
I am wondering how well the travel system is in WoW though as it looks like the mage is the only class lined up to be able to port to different places.  Although traveling through Norath before wizards and druids were of level to group gate everyone was very very fun and entertaining in both an explorational and risk aspect, they were very time consuming and so later on in the game were made trivial to the older players (and unfortunately most newer players as well).  I wonder how they will make traveling more of a trivial aspect as you get higher in level without depending too highly on the availability of mages to port everyone around like the druid and wizards of EQ were so labeled and possibly &quot;forced labour&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the flexibility of the WoW druid so far, with the single worry about mobility.   And that will be a function of how fast I can get around without ports, AND the size of the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there's one thing I've learned about MMOG's and how they evolve, its that mobility is the first thing that's farmed out to the entire game.  Every single MMOG I've played (all major ones) has done this, and reduced the allure of the porting/high speed class to being useless, either by giving everyone the same abilities, or by completely disabling the mobility aspects in one way or another in new content.<br />
<br />
Very cheap shortcut by the devs, but pervasive unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slow travels gets wearisome to players pretty quickly, especially after they get powerful and have played a long time.  So it makes sense to add shortcuts they have access to.<br />
<br />
I like how the form a druid takes changes their role entirely.  That's a pretty cool concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balise</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since mages seem to the be only class capable of porting a group around the globe it could possibly be that they have already implemented some form of porting for all the classes that is restricted to the higher levels.  I hope this is the case as the mages will still be usefull for porting at the lower levels, but since they specialize in utility and damage their porting abilities are not nearly a core ability and so they wont feel too bad about losing their significance of porting at the higher levels I am sure, saying that though I dont plan on playing a mage due mainly to that it doesnt suit my playstyle or at least I dont find it as attractive as some of the other classes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BGrifter</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My big concern when I hear &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; is that (thinking longterm) when a Druid reaches the endgame (or at least high level content) will we be able to do anything effectively enough to justify a spot in a group/guild? Seems like the same pitfalls we experience in EQ all over again.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I really want to level a character for the next year or two only to discover i'm not really good enough at any one thing to justify my existance. Of course this has been VASTLY improved in EQ over the last while with the upgrade in Druid healing and the addition of Pot9, but I still remeber the days before PoP with a twinge of bitterness.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the solution would be making one of the three paths listed the focus of your character development? At lower levels we could tank as bear, do solid DPS as a cat, and heal adequately in normal form, but at higher levels we have to choose between the three? Diablo II style skill tree development is fine with me as long as at the end of a year or two I don't end up with a toon that heals worse than a priest, does worse damage than the DPS classes and can't tank worth a damn. :)</div></div><hr />
