WoW Druid Class (http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/classes.shtml#druid)<br />
Druids are the keepers of the world. Locked in slumber for generations, they awoke to meet the threat of the Burning Legion during its recent invasion. After Archimonde's defeat, the Druids chose to remain in the waking world and help to rebuild their shattered lands. The Legion's attack left a terrible scar on the natural order, and the Druids seek to heal it. <br />
<br />
The Druid of World of Warcraft was designed as a ‘Jack of All Trades’ type of character – yet master of none. Key abilities of the Druid include the ability to Shapeshift into various animal forms, some formidable in their own right, others as innocuous critters and beasties, best used for scouting and possibly ambush of the enemy. Along with the power of the Druid to Shapeshift comes a full spellbook. At its core, the druid is a powerful healer (when not in animal form). <br />
<br />
The name of the game for the World of Warcraft Druid is versatility. This versatility will guarantee a spot for the Druid in any adventuring party. From http://www.fohguild.org <br />
<br />
Examples of Druid spells:<br />
<br />
Shapeshifting - Druids can assume a variety of animal forms to aid them in both travel and combat. The Night Saber panther and Storm Crow are just two of the shapes Druids will be able to assume. <br />
<br />
Currently the Druid has the ability to Shapeshift into two forms: Bear and Cat. As a Bear, the Druid becomes a Warrior. While not having anywhere near the abilities of a pure Warrior, the Druid in Bearform is granted a Rage bar and some of the key abilities available to the pure Warrior. It has to be noted that while in this form, the Druid cannot cast spells. Do not be fooled, however, into thinking a Shapeshifted Druid in Bear form will not make a formidable tank. With the loss of their spellcasting power, they make tangible gains in the ability to take and dish out some damage.<br />
<br />
As a Cat, the Druid takes on the abilities of the Rogue. Key to these abilities is the ability to Stealth and Scout. Some of the damage dealing capabilities of the Rogue may also be granted to the Druid in Cat form. <br />
<br />
Note: While only two of the Druid’s Shapeshifting classes have been listed in this update, I [editor's note: Furor] was ASSURED that there will definitely be more forms that the Druid will be able to take later in their life. Some of these forms may augment the Druid’s ability to swim and others may be used in PvP warfare.<br />
From http://www.fohguild.org <br />
<br />
Editor's Note: Blizzard.com lists &quot;Night Saber panther and Storm Crow&quot; as two examples of what forms druids can shapeshift into while fohguild.org says &quot;bear and cat&quot;. Time will tell.<br />
<br />
Tangling Roots - outdoor Root to stop their enemy in their tracks, immbolizing them outright. From http://www.fohguild.org<br />
<br />
Rejuvenation - In keeping with the Druids' philosophy to restore and regenerate the world, they have the ability to rejuvenate their allies. This ability restores health over time to any wounded being. No instant cast heals no powerful Area of Effect Heals that the Priest class has available. [However,] &quot;The Druid in caster form will be balanced to compete with the healing capabilities of the Priest. While he will not have the same versatility in healing, his raw healing output will be similar. Groups ideally will be equally happy having either a Priest or Druid in the group for healing.&quot; (R. Pardo) From http://www.fohguild.org<br />
Classes with similiar spells: <br />
Priest - Heal<br />
Shaman - Restoration<br />
Paladin - Holy Light<br />
<br />
Mark of the Wild - Druids have the ability to aid themselves and others using Mark of the Wild. Initially this spell will enhance a few basic character attributes. Eventually Mark of the Wild will be one of the best character enhancements available buffing all attributes. <br />
and many more...(?)<br />
<br />
Edit: Blizzard has just updated the Druid page and removed Faerie Fire replacing it with Mark of the Wild.  It is yet unknown if we get Faerie Fire still-Aidon</div></div><hr />

Druids are the keepers of the world. Locked in slumber for generations, they awoke to meet the threat of the <br />
Burning Legion during its recent invasion. After Archimonde's defeat, the Druids chose to remain in the waking <br />
world and help to rebuild their shattered lands. The Legion's attack left a terrible scar on the natural order, <br />
and the Druids seek to heal it.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
The Druid gives players several playing style options. The Druid in normal form is a caster that can fight with <br />
spells or via melee combat. In Bear form the Druid becomes a Warrior with Rage. In Cat form the Druid becomes a <br />
Rogue with Energy and stealth. The Druid can also transform into two other special animal forms. The Druid also <br />
acts as a secondary healer to the Priest. <br />

&lt;P&gt;	<br />
This page does not have a complete listing of all abilities that are available. Look for more once our database section is active.<br />
&lt;P&gt;	<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Nature Magic&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Healing Touch&lt;/B&gt; - Heals a friendly target for X to X. This is the Druid's main healing spell. You can only use this ability while you are in Druid form. There are times where you should have two levels of this spell available on your action bar to use based on how damaged the target is. You don't want to waste mana by using a more powerful heal than is necessary. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/B&gt; - Heals the target for X over X seconds. Rejuvenation is good to have active during combat. That way when the enemy is causing damage you are healing during that time mitigating some of that damage. If you or a party member is slightly damaged after battle you can cast Rejuvenation to help heal up that remaining amount. Rejuvenation is also useful to cast on tanks that are pulling monsters.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Regrowth&lt;/B&gt; - Heals a friendly target for X to X and another X over X seconds. This spell is a mix of a heal and a <br />
heal over time spell. Regrowth takes a while to cast so you don't typically want to use it on yourself when you're being attacked. This spell is typically useful after battle or for casting on party members who are damaged but are not taking significant damage. Otherwise you will want to switch to Healing Touch instead. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Tranquility&lt;/B&gt; - Regenerates all nearby group members for X ever X seconds for X seconds. Druid must channel to maintain the spell. If a monster interrupts this spell it will cancel. This ability would be best used when multiple party members need healing at once.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/B&gt; (Curse) - Decrease the armor of the target by X for X seconds. While affected, the target cannot stealth or turns invisible. This is a staple Druid spell that should be worked into combat the second it is available. Be sure to only use this ability when you're in melee combat with the enemy. If you're just casting spells on a monster, Faerie Fire is not needed.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Thorns&lt;/B&gt; (Additional damage buff) - Thorns sprout from the friendly target doing X nature damage to anyone who hits them. This is a mid-range timed buff that adds additional damage to the enemy in melee combat. Cast this on any party member that is tanking. Always have this up when you're in melee combat with the enemy.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Wrath&lt;/B&gt; (DD) - Causes X to X nature damage to the target. This is your first available direct damage blast spell. This is useful for causing initial damage to the enemy. It's also useful for finishing off an enemy that is trying to run away.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/B&gt; (Powerful Buff!) - Increases all friendly target's armor by X. At higher levels this spell adds an increase to all attributes. At even higher levels this ability also ads an increase to all resistances. This is one of the most powerful buffs in the game making a Druid a welcome addition to a party. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/B&gt; - Roots the target in place and causes X nature damage over X seconds. Only usable outdoors. This spell has many uses. You can use Entangling Roots to break up spawns (groups of monsters). Cast Entangling Roots on a monster you wish to remain out of combat. Then engage the remaining monster(s). You can use Entangling Roots in solo combat to allow you to blast the enemy with Wrath or Starfire while the monster cannot respond. Another use of Entangling Roots it to stop runners from escaping to warn their friends.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Soothe Animal&lt;/B&gt; - Soothes the target beast, reducing the range at which it will attack you by X yards. Only affects targets level 39 or lower. This ability will help you avoid combat with a beast. If there are several beasts next to each other you can cast Sooth Animal on one then engage the other. This ability can also be useful for avoiding combat while traveling. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Curse Poison&lt;/B&gt; - Curses 1 Poison effect on the target. Another welcome ability when monsters are casting annoying poison on you.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Abolish Poison&lt;/B&gt; - Attempts to cure 1 poison effect on the target and another poison effect every X seconds.<br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Arcane Magic&lt;/B&gt;<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Moonfire&lt;/B&gt; (DoT) - Burns the enemy for X to X damage and then an additional X damage over X seconds. This ability gives a starting blast and then damages over time. You should use this ability whenever you're fighting the monster long enough for the spell to run its full duration. Otherwise, you're just wasting mana. Moonfire is also good for stopping runners before they get help. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Starfire&lt;/B&gt; - Causes X to X damage to the target. The first question once this is available is typically how is this different from Wrath? Starfire is a different school of magic (arcane) allowing you to build up Arcane Magic skills. Starfire takes longer to cast but does more damage. It's a good initial strike spell. Additionally, Starfire does full damage while Wrath does nature damage. If the enemy has resistances to nature damage, Starfire is more effective to use.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/B&gt; - Dispels X curse from the target. This is a welcome ability as no one likes to be cursed!<br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Shapeshifting&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
The Druid can turn into a Bear, Cat, and transform into Aquatic Form and Traveling Form. The main penalty for this <br />
transformation is that the Druid is unable to cast spells, use items, or even talk to NPCs. This requires management <br />
of the forms. You will likely have to switch to Druid Form after combat to cast spells, heal, use buffs, then return <br />
to combat (Bear or Cat) when you're ready to fight again. You will also need to learn which is the best form to <br />
fight in for each situation.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Druid Form&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
This form is useful when soloing until your Cat abilities are built up. While in parties if you are acting as a healer, <br />
you will need to remain in this form so you're ready to heal. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Bear Form&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
While in Bear Form you are similar to a Warrior. You might wish to read over the &lt;a href=&quot;warrior.shtml&quot;&gt;Warrior page&lt;/a&gt; <br />
for insights on how to play a Warrior. Bear form increases armor, hit points, and allows the use of various bear abilities. <br />
Bear Form is useful in parties when you need someone to tank. The Bear has several useful abilities including taunt and a <br />
stun to prevent spellcasters from casting. These abilities are only useable in Bear Form.<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Swipe&lt;/B&gt; - Swipe X nearby enemies<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Growl&lt;/B&gt; - Adds a small amount of threat to the target. This is your taunt ability used to get the monster to attack you rather than a weak party member such as a spell caster. You will need to use this ability a lot to train it up to useful levels. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Demoralizing Roar&lt;/B&gt; - The Druid roars, decreasing nearby enemies attack power by X.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Maul&lt;/B&gt; - Increases the Druid's next attack by x damage.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Enrage&lt;/B&gt; - Generates X rage over X sec. but decreases armor by X%. The Druid is considered in combat for the duration.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Bash&lt;/B&gt; - Bashes the target, stunning him for x seconds. This of course is especially useful against spell casters <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
Challenging Roar - Taunts all nearby enemies for X sec.<br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
Shapeshift into aquatic form, increasing swim speed and allowing the druid to breath underwater. Aquatic form looks like an <br />
angry seal. This form is useful for exploring in the water. It's useful for traveling by water faster than by land until <br />
travel form is available. Trick: if you're fighting under water and are about to run out of air (breath), convert to <br />
Aquatic Form to replenish under water. Then switch back. You can fight in Aquatic Form for laughs but you can't use any <br />
special abilities or cast spells. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Cat Form&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
Shapeshift into cat form, increasing attack speed and allowing the use of various cat abilities. The cat is <br />
much like the Rogue. You should read the &lt;a href=&quot;rogue.shtml&quot;&gt;Rogue Basics page&lt;/a&gt; for more details on how to play a rogue. <br />
Many of these abilities are similar to Rogue abilities. Cat Form is best for soloing and for party use. If you're a Rogue player, <br />
you can appreciate how useful this form can be. <br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Sneak&lt;/B&gt; - Allows the Druid to sneak around, but reduces your speed to X% of normal. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Claw&lt;/B&gt;  - Claw the enemy, causing 15 additional damage. Awards 1 combo point.<br />
&lt;P&gt;	<br />
&lt;B&gt;Rip&lt;/B&gt;  - Finishing move that causes damage over time. Damage increases per combo point. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Shred&lt;/B&gt; - Shred the target, causing 150% damage plus X damage to the target. Must be behind the target. Awards 1 combo point. You do not need to be in stealth mode to use this ability.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Feline Fury&lt;/B&gt;  - Increase damage done by X for X sec.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Rake&lt;/B&gt;  - Rake the target for X damage and X damage over X seconds. Awards 1 combo point. Because this is a damage over time spell, you only should use it when you intend to fight a monster long enough for the spell to reach its full duration.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Dash&lt;/B&gt; - Increases movement speed for X sec.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Cower&lt;/B&gt; - Cower, causing no damage but lowering your threat a small amount. Awards 1 combo point. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Man Tracking&lt;/B&gt; - Having a hard time keeping track of your man?... I mean Shows the location of all nearby humanoids <br />
on the minimap for X minutes. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Play Dead&lt;/B&gt; - Druid falls over, imitating death to trick enemies into leaving him or her alone.<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Pounce&lt;/B&gt; - Pounce. Stunning the target for X sec and causing X damage over X sec. Must be stealthed and behind the target. Awards 1 combo point.<br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Travel Form&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
Transforms the druid into a travel form, increasing movement speed. You become a cool looking cheetah. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
<br />

&lt;LI&gt;	Cast Moonfire on the enemy<br />
&lt;LI&gt;	Cast Faerie Fire<br />

<br />
Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;index.shtml&quot;&gt;Warrior and Rogue pages&lt;/a&gt; for tips on playing in Bear (Warrior) and Cat (Rogue) form. <br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;B&gt;Trade Skill Options&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br />
You can pick whatever you want. You might find these more tailored to the Druid<br />
&lt;P&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Skinning and Leather crafting&lt;/B&gt; - The Druid can create their own equipment and sell it To others.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Herbalism and Enchanting&lt;/B&gt; - The Druid can enchant their equipment to make themselves more powerful.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
&lt;B&gt;Herbalism and Alchemy&lt;/B&gt; - The Druid can create buff potions or healing potions.<br />
