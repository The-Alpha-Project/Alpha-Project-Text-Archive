<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takoda Windrunner</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well having been a long time beta tester of WoW, I first can say I really enjoyed the experience, the game is probably the best MMO to date.<br />
<br />
I am however extremely disapointed that a company like blizzard would ship a product that is quite simply, not finished.<br />
<br />
Level 31-60 spells for a lot of classes are not in the game in the current build. Thats almost half the entire character development, I dont think thats an acceptable thing to cut. Shaman for example get a total of 2 new unique spells from level 31-60 and thats it.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no PvP system in place to make it worthwhile or give reason. The honor system, pvp ranking ladder, amoung other things they promised simply did not make the cut. Currently PvP is a lot of graveyard rushing and ganking by level 60s on level 20s with no reward or penalty either way. PvP is a good 1/3 of WoWs content, and it was not developed at ALL in beta, what does this say?<br />
<br />
Most classes are done well, but there are a few that still have serious glaring class breaking issues that are totally unresolved. Druids bear form AC is almost half a high level warriors AC and they are not able to perform the role of tank as blizzard said they should, the cat form doesnt have a DD finisher and the DPS is no where near good, warriors get owned by unarmed paladins punching them to death after the &quot;awesome&quot; warrior changes, mages spend a good 25-40% of their time sitting and drinking while soloing after every 1-2 mobs, shaman are still extremely overpowered in PvP, etc..<br />
<br />
There are only a few raid encounters in the game currently, a handful at best, that will not keep level 60 guilds occupied for long at all. They say they are holding a lot of raid content back, but even looking at the onyxia raid and how it broke, I wonder why they think they can hold back raid content and have it untested. Are we too experience onyxia type bugs with the instance during retail because blizzard didnt want to release the rest of the raid material to the beta testers?<br />
<br />
Itemization is still horrible at the top end of the game. Warriors, rogues, and other equipment based characters benefit greatly post 60 by getting uber raid gear and purple items, meanwhile casters like mages do not gain any significant power by equipment and so they are essentially at their max potential when they ding 60, meanwhile the melee characters keep improving. Moreso, hunters experience a severe shortage of high end bows/guns, some beta players can name the entire list of available ranged weapons on one hand, and they usually are lacking in the damage department. Druids feral forms damage is not based on equipped weapons, so that means they will not increase in damage by geting raid equipment like the warrior and rogue will, therefore making the already large gap even larger.<br />
<br />
There are many other issues aswell, and its disheartening that blizzard feels these hugely important issues are nothing worth worrying about and are rushing the game out the door to make christmas sales anyway before its done. Battlegrounds? hero classes? seige engines? I doubt we will see any of them at all.<br />
<br />
I love WoW and im as excited as the next person to buy it on tuesday and get playing, but im just disapointed, I had hoped this last patch would solve all my concerns, but it did not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the topic of raids..they were testing (many?) more raids in-house, as they didn't want them spoiled at all before release. The raids we are(were) able to access in the beta was just a small sample.<br />
<br />
And it's hardly a surprise the game is shipping unfinished. There's no such thing as finished in an MMORPG. It's hardly a surprise it's shipper lighter than it &quot;should&quot;. Blizzard or not, they can only spend so much time and money on a game before they have to get it out. And in this game, it's a hell of a lot easier to do so than their other games. PvP was supposed to go in the next patch. So whether that's the release patch, or one shortly after, we'll see on Tuesday/soon.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Also hero classes have been said to be a post-release addition for a long time now. And PvP is 5, maybe 10% of WoWs content if they're lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takoda Windrunner</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I know they said they are testing the supposed extra raid content in house. They also tested onyxia raid in house aswell, and look what happened to that when it was released to the public, they had all kinds of problems with loading the instance more then once. That just shows that in house testing sometimes is not enough, it wasnt enough for the onyxia raid and im not sure why I should believe the unknown raids are any different.<br />
<br />
I agree that MMOs are never techincally finished, but I think we can both agree that if you look over my short list of complaints, these are not things that should be cut from any released game. If you need to cut things then fine, but half the character development in the form of 31-60 spells? entire PvP honor system? itemization for casters? class functionality? That is totally different then cutting something like battlegrounds or hero classes which is not core to the game.<br />
<br />
I will respectfully disagree with your PvP assessment being 5-10% of the game. WoW is a PvP game, its built right into its core, even on PvE servers PvP is built in. There are three main parts to this game as listed by blizzard themselves. (forms down, sorry cant get you the link)<br />
<br />
1. Level 1-60 game <br />
2. Raid content<br />
3. PvP<br />
<br />
PvP is indeed a good 1/3 of what WoW has to offer even though its not finished yet (which is one of my complaints). Some people may choose not to participate in it at all and thats fine, but the intention of WoW by the developers is that part of WoWs content, wether your on a PvE sever or not.. is PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many other issues aswell, and its disheartening that blizzard feels these hugely important issues are nothing worth worrying about and are rushing the game out the door to make christmas sales anyway before its done.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats a bit pessimistic.  Blizzard hasn't done anything to suggest that they will suddenly not implement features like that at all.   I'm confident we'll see the PvP changes in the next content patch, I'm not sure if that was to include battlegrounds or not.    Blizzard has said all along that they are holding back raid content for release, so I'm not too concerned on that score either, especially since I personally won't be at the level to worry about it for another month or two.  :)  I'm also extremely confident that we'll end up seeing Hero Classes within a few months after release as people reach the point where it will matter.<br />
<br />
Now, having said that, am I a bit disappointed that it doesn't have everything in and done like it should have?  Sure thing.  But this is still the most polished MMO I have EVER played even in its current state and there are certain business realities that even a company like Blizzard must adhere to.  Especially with Vivendi calling some shots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it might be pessimistic true, I mean none of us can really see the future and know wether they will impliment hero classes and battlegrounds like they said. But I remember the D2 beta and all the things that were cut from that game and said to be in after release. Do you rememebr Guild Halls and more importantly Arenas? They were said to be in after release.. well its been years and still no sign of Arenas.<br />
<br />
Yeah blizzard could suprise me, but usually when they say &quot;maybe after release&quot;, that translates into &quot;expansion pack or not at all&quot;. It may end up being different since its an MMORPG that they continually make money from, we will have to see, but im not holding my breath.<br />
<br />
Besides though, hero classes and battlegrounds are far less important then the other issues I raised, the issues that are core to the game and yet are still not implimented.<br />
<br />
Raids being held back? yeah, ive read them saying that too, even if they do pull a rabbit out of their hat, that is only 1 issue on my list =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly right imho.  With games like D2, there was no &quot;live&quot; staff to speak of.  Basically, like one guy was still working on D2 after release, as opposed to an entire staff like you get with an ongoing MMORPG.  <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Well, there we just disagree a bit, as I think hero classes, battlegrounds/PVP and raids are the three most critical things that WoW is still lacking in.  But lets go through your other items:<br />
<br />
More unique high level spell lines - I do agree that these still need fleshing out.  Talents have helped somewhat to offset this, but many classes still need a bit more oomph at the upper end.  I just don't think its as critical as you make it out to be, as it was still a blast to play these classes at high levels.  :)<br />
<br />
Class Balance Issues - This is going to be ongoing for the rest of the games life as we've seen in every MMOG to date.  No one will ever be 100% satisfied.  Its just the way of these things.  If Blizzard had held back release another year, you or someone else would still be making these same complaints although maybe about different classes.  IE, they fix the bear form ac/aggro issues and maybe warriors start complaining that druids are better than them, or the like.  Even though I see issues that affect my chosen classes, I really think this is a non issue.  Things will be fixed, other things will be broken, and the cycle will go on and on forever more. <br />
<br />
Caster Items - Yeah, you've got me on this one, because not only do I agree with you, but I really have no faith that Blizzard will fix this.  I remember a post by Pardo that made me feel very pessimistic on the subject.  Something needs to be done, but I have no idea if it ever will be.<br />
<br />
I believe that covers your issues from my perspective.  :)</div></div><hr />

What do you think Blizzard is going to do after release? Sit on their butts in their chairs and do nothing but play their game? Come one, you're whining about features that Blizzard has stated for a long, long time they will not be putting them in on release due to time constraints. Blizzard understood they wouldn't get them in for a long time, and have stated just that. They NEVER promised they would be in the game by the time it hit the shelves.</div></div><hr />

Better than any other MMORPG I've seen on release, even the beloved EQ.  Being a MMOG it can never be finished, just good enough to get started.<br />
<br />
Vivendi is also a harsh taskmaster.  They have some problems and need a good product or two to deter attention from their &quot;financial miscalculations&quot;, shall we say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with you. <br />
<br />
Actually I NEVER remember a game that was really 'ready' for release. If a company were to wait until all balancing was done, and content was in --the graphics engine and design would be years behind what is expected.<br />
<br />
I found WoW to be very 'bug free', compared to most games I have seen at release.<br />
<br />
They do have a glaring problem that I hope they address if they expect a smooth  release.  <br />
<br />
The system they had for beta-patching and downloads ...is not acceptable in today's marketplace.  They need to find something better than the bit-torrent implemenation they have right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The patch this week didn't use the Torrent system and it worked pretty well.  Hopefully that'll be what they use in Release.  They always said during beta that the Torrent system was being used because of the huge downloads they were needing to put out.  Even at that, their implementation of the Torrent system wasn't the best :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing of note about the lack of spells.  It's possible that they are some of the content Blizzard has done but are holding back.  Apparently we've only seen roughly a third of the finished content (according to Rob Pardo a couple months back on the forums).   I wonder what the other 2 thirds are... you know, besides raids.<br />
Also if you look in the patch notes thread there's a quote stating that Battlegrounds and the PvP system are coming in the next content update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game was &quot;finished&quot; more in beginning of closed beta than any other MMORPG was at release.  They could of released it last month and still been above all others.  Like stated before, these games are NEVER finished pre release.  You cant make everyone happy, someone will always says its not done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with giving casters huge gear improvements at the high levels is...it trivializes things, or makes things very difficult at the high level, if you appropriately balance casters for great gear improvements at the late game.<br />
<br />
If you do such balance, then raids like molten core, where resist gear is of import, your casters become too weak for the encounter in their resist gear.<br />
<br />
Can't have the cake and eat it too.  If casters want the cool gear at high levels, they have to become highly gear dependant, like melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus, I'm sure that Blizzard works like any other development system.  You work hard to get your core components finished and solid by release, you work on other things later - especially the things that could cause instability to the core engine.  You release a solid product, monitor in a freeze-type environment (unless emergency patches are required) and then start working on new or finishing additional content.<br />

Better to have a stable product with fewer bells and whistles than an unstable piece of software with 101 features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No infact its good basic game design, very easy to understand why this needs to be done in a game which progression does not stop at level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I played my rogue to 37, it was nice to feel like I was never really dependent on my gear the entire time. I think Blizzard did a very good job with the item itemizations.<br />
<br />
And of course, unlike EQ, in this game you really don't see what your stats, hp and mana are without gear since when you die you still have your gear stats (in ghost form) and you rez with full gear on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally dont' think so, but I suspect there are a ton of mages, priests, and warlocks who would throw a fit.<br />
<br />
Plus it makes it harder to balance.<br />
<br />
During beta, there was gear which was truly amazing for casters +dmg and +healing of various types.<br />
<br />
It had to be nerfed hard because mages could build dmg gear outfits which were just plain sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You see it more as a tank class.<br />
<br />
Your gear determines your hps/ac..and those are readily available.<br />
<br />
I knew, as a paladin before the patch, that if the warrior in my group had 500-700 hps less than me with AC similiar to mine...we were in trouble as a group hehe.<br />
<br />
To a lesser degree priests are gear dependant.  You know what a priests mana pool is and you have a better idea of what your group will and won't be able to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I think WoW has done a great job of having the CORE components AND some of the bells and whistles in.<br />
<br />
I am not sure some of the recent MMORPG's have done that.<br />
<br />
1. Horizons released with the entire 'core' of the dragonkind not working. (not to mention the lag that went on for months)<br />
<br />
2. EQ2 just released with none of the Artisan class working as intended.  The quests are not fully in or tested. Half the recipes are missing, and the tradeskill instances keep crashing. (which would not be a problem if tradeskills in that game were like EQ or WOW -- where it's just a hobby to do with your main).  <br />
<br />
3. SWG - well I really don't even have to list all of the core game that was missing in that release!<br />
<br />
In the beginning of MMORPG's (UO, EQ, AC) etc.they tried very hard to have the core game working.  Most of the recent releases have really gone to a 'Pay to Betatest' mentality.<br />
<br />
Most do not run the long Betatests anymore. They opt to Beta for about 3 months then shove unfinished products out to the public. <br />
<br />
At least Blizzard had a longer Beta test, with several stress tests. Its a step back in the right direction!</div></div><hr />

I've always felt that they were the class of the game development communitee.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with being gear dependant as a caster class as long as there is gear to be had.  This always tweaked me with EQ.  There would a few items for Druids and a bag full for upgrades for melee.</div></div><hr />
