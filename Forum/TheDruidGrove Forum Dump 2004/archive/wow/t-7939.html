We have gone to great lengths to ensure that your experience in the land of Azeroth is as enjoyable and immersive as possible. However, this immersion can be quickly broken when you see the stately Tauren Hunter named &quot;IOwnsU&quot; or the imposing Night Elf Druid &quot;ErnestBorgnine.&quot; In an attempt to maintain the suspension of disbelief, we will be disallowing all non fantasy-related names for the World of Warcraft Stress Test. This currently applies only to the Stress Test realms and not to the existing Closed Beta Test realms. You see, Alpha, Beta, and Stress Tests are not only an opportunity for us to test the stability of the software, but also an opportunity to test our support. Depending on the results of this test, we may or may not add this to our retail naming policy. Thank you for your cooperation in this little trial run and enjoy your travels! <br />
Non Fantasy-Related This category includes names which: <br />
<br />
Deviate from classic high fantasy names <br />
Are references to pop culture or generally anachronistic <br />
Are statements in and of themselves <br />
If a player is found to have such a name, he/she will: <br />
Be prompted to select a new name <br />
Be given a warning <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I hope this sticks, I like the idea of the new naming policy and though I think it's going to be near impossible to police efficiently, I think it will make a better overall game for my enjoyment at least.</div></div><hr />

I saw some guy named GeorgeWBooosh or something similar on the Neltharion server the other night.  I am not sure if they care about names for this stress test though, since its primary reason is to test the server load.<br />
<br />
Well I am outta here, gonna go hit up my stress test and see what damage I can do.</div></div><hr />

I'm over on Malygos now since the 2hrs of &quot;half servers&quot; kinda forced me there.  My rogue is level 9, named Jeane.  God, there are a lot of names I just want to report: Sexychick, Azeroth, LordMalygos, Palypimp, WeeDRangeR (iirc), KISStheRINGS, MADDAWG.  On the actual Beta server, there was a pink haired naked gnome in IF named Queerbait.<br />
<br />
*shrug*  The poor GMs... A couple of 'em kept saying the same old &quot;please refrain from inappropriate language blahblah&quot; and people totally disregarded them and kept spouting off. Some of those people are still on a day later lol</div></div><hr />

I'd hate to be in their shoes.</div></div><hr />

They lost me on this one. Don't you *want* to encurage fantasy style naming? But naturally not use ones that are trademarked?<br />
<br />
And yes, I too have seen a rather large varity of names out there. I think it was a bad idea to allow so many cases within a name. I've seen names all over the place, most with the kiddy &quot;hacker&quot; style of mixed case. I made it a point not to group with them.</div></div><hr />
