<br />
Hey everybody, <br />
<br />
We just wanted to share the news with you that Katricia is no longer with Blizzard. She's pursuing other opportunities, and we wish her the best. Please continue posting in the forums as normal. We continue to read each post and will do our best to keep you well informed of what's happening in the game and why. <br />
<br />
Please note that we're currently expanding our community team, and we expect to have a few new members on board in the near future. In the meantime, some of our other teams, including the World of Warcraft development team, have offered to spend some extra time in the forums, personally reviewing your suggestions, responding to your posts, and keeping you informed of new developments. You can check out some of the latest information we've posted here: <br />

She's been fun, entertaining, forthcoming with information and very good at putting up with the bad apples in the World of Warcraft community.<br />
<br />
She'll be missed by me at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there were some posts by her stating she'd received a similar offer from another company.  However, the posts seem to have been deleted.  There was another post that apparently wasn't even her? or something, so I'm not really sure what's up with it.<br />
<br />
Thottbot archived the deleted posts:<br />

<br />
Edit: The WoW post monitor (http://wow.ethrex.com/) doesn't even show the posts.  So, perhaps those were fake too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the whole thing is really weird.  Definitely feels like she got fired to me, based on the way it was announced.  I wonder what happened.  <br />
<br />
And yes, those were fake posts by someone named wyrmguy or something, not Kat.</div></div><hr />
