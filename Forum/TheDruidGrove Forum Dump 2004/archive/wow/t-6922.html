<br />
One of the first things they announced with that in mind was their no fail combines for trade skills.<br />
<br />
That's right.  If you have the appropriate skill and components, you make what you aim to make, evidently.  Find more on WoW tradeskills  here  (http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/tradeskills.shtml)<br />
<br />
Secondly...they've recently announced that the banks in WoW will not hold coins...because coins will have no encumbrance and there will be no limit to the amount characters can carry.  Unfortunately that means no more fun playing with /split and monks.  Again, further info can be found  here  (http://www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/banking.shtml)</div></div><hr />

Whatcha wanna bet that EQ eventually makes coins either weigh less or gives you an AA to make them weigh less?</div></div><hr />

PITA corpse runs, big death penalties, large time sinks, long travel times. Sounds like a real blast. Good thing there are many more choices for games these days.</div></div><hr />
