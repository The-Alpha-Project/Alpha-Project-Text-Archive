Druids and Shamans can now utilize the talent interface by pressing the &quot;Talents&quot; button next to the &quot;Spellbook and Abilities&quot; button, or by pressing the &quot;N&quot; default hotkey. Talents become available (to classes that currently have talents) to players starting at level 10.<br />
<br />
A substantial number of talents have been modified in a variety of ways:<br />
<br />
Certain talents have had their potency increased or decreased.<br />
<br />
Locations of talents in the talent trees have changed.<br />
<br />
Functionality of certain talents has been modified.<br />
<br />
New talents have been added to some of the existing talent trees.<br />
<br />
Druids:<br />
<br />
Cower no longer generates a combo point; energy cost reduced.<br />
<br />
Demoralizing Roar effect reduced at higher ranks.<br />
<br />
Track Humanoids now lasts until canceled, like other tracking abilities.<br />
<br />
As often as I used Cat form, I never noticed Cower gave me combo points.  Sure wish I could see our talent trees, too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 handed blunt weapons allowed <br />
<br />
tornado talent 10 seconds 55 damage, little mana <br />
<br />
interesting weapon enchants <br />
<br />
Bear Paw (dunno real name) has increased effectiveness <br />
<br />
Self ressurection <br />
<br />
One of the talents has this thing where you have 35% chance of casting lv 1 root(?) on an opponent when being successfully hit or attacked. <br />
<br />
Druid get many talents that will decrease the casting time of your spells. <br />
<br />
Starfire has a chance to stun opponents - talent <br />
<br />
transforming 40% less mana - talent <br />
<br />
Elaboration on Bear form <br />
When in bear form, you get 1 sec stun ability, 5 sec casting interference. Effective in 8-25 meters, 15 second waiting time (not sure if they mean cooldown or casting.) <br />
<br />
Crit's stun may continue for 1 sec longer. Regular rage usage dec by 5. Power inc by 20%. When applying successful crit attack, you get additional 5 rage. <br />
<br />
When in leopard or panther form, you get evil strike(blow?) power usage dec by 5. Power inc by 20%. Skill damage inc by 20%, Crit possibility inc by 10%, when successfully attacking something in stealth, you get contact power inc by 1 (I'm guessing they mean by rage?) <br />
<br />
By the way, it seem in cheetah form, you get speed inc by 30% <br />
<br />
Druids start with dagger, no weapon, or staff. Now, it seems that you don't get to use either 1-hand blunt weapon or javalins. (I'm sure you get to learn to use blunt weapons because I saw earlier that you get to learn dual wield blunt weapons.) <br />
<br />
3 kinds of faerie fire <br />
<br />
In bear form, in cat form, and in regular form. The effects are the same. They just differ in terms of in what form you get to use them. So, if you don't use transformation, you just need to learn 1 form of fairy fire. <br />
<br />
[More info on hurricane] <br />
<br />
It's not off of a talent. It's a lv 50 spell. You use 885 mana to cast. 1 min cooldown period. When used, you do dmg of 98 per second. Also, you get 25% decrease of attack power while using the spell. 10 second continuation, so a total of 1000 dmg, but if you have multiple enemies, you can do a lot more dmg.  By the way, this is hurricane lv 1.  So, druids get AE.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure but I'm thinking &quot;Tornado&quot; (early on in the quote) and &quot;Hurricane&quot; are actually related if not the same.  While the amount of dmg is done, damn that's a HIGH mana cost.  I'm curious as to whether this is a channeling spell, too.  It's definitely nice to finally get an AE.<br />
<br />
Cool we can finally use 2h Maces.  Confused about &quot;Bear Paw's increased effectiveness&quot;:  Maul or Swipe?  Also confused by the 3 different types of Faerie Fire thing?  Does this mean that in norm, bear and cat, we can cast some type of &quot;Faerie Fire&quot;?  I wonder how they would differ in that they aren't the same in the combative forms.</div></div><hr />

Druid Talents <br />
<br />
So far, all I know is they are called &quot;recovery,&quot; &quot;balance/harmony,&quot; and &quot;beastiary.&quot; All 3 trees have something for when you are tranformed. <br />
<br />
Someone from Korean server mentions that beastiary tree is mainly for soloing, recovery is for party, and balance might be for PvP. But this is only 1 person's words, so I won't take them too seriously. <br />
<br />
Under recovery tree, things are mainly for healing upgrade and also self res. The cooldown on self res is 3 min. Not bad considering the fact that you release after 5 min. (I saw someone's post earlier about possibility of 5 party of druids. This might be possible?) <br />
<br />
He thinks the most important thing in recovery tree is a thing called &quot;nature's gift.&quot; If you study this+self res+recovery, healing becomes very useful and effective. There is also a thing called &quot;reflect.&quot; It sounds like it might be to reflect certain spells and send it back to the caster. But no elaboration, so don't hold me to it. So, in order to get these 4 skills, you need to invest: minimum req = 15 points + 6~7 points for those skills = 21~22 points. <br />
<br />
Second tree is balance/harmony tree. He thinks this tree might not be too useful in soloing or partying. He thinks this might be good for PvP. The very first skill is called &quot;nature's hand.&quot; It has chance to root those who hurt druids. (cannot be used in underground, I heard.) Additionally, you get skills increase the range of offensive spells like moonlight strike and starfire strike or something like that. Also, it has possibility of stunning an opponent when the starlight strike hits. When you invest fully in moonlight strike, you get about 200 dmg up. When you invest fully in starlight strike, you get up to 990 dmg, but he thinks that this is still not comparable to spells of mages. Thorn seems to have improved, and he says that that would be the only spell useful in groups. <br />
<br />
In this tree, you also get something called &quot;virtue of clarity (or similiar to that)&quot; which allows you to enchant your weapon. He says something about this skill allows you to not use mana for the dmg that was done by weapon, but I am lost there. Hurricane also falls under this tree, and he thinks that this will be very useful in PvP because it has a large area effect for pretty good dmg in addition to cutting off enemy's attack by 20%. <br />
<br />
Last tree is called &quot;beastiary.&quot; He thinks that beastiary passives are the best. There are things like cutting 25% of mana used for transformation. He thinks that panther form might be better than bear form as he was able to do up to 800 dmg in BRD as a panther. When you learn both agility (not the stat point) and stealth, you get up to 100% increased speed under stealth. And naturally panthers have increased attack speed. ATM, he does about 100 dmg with occasional crit of 200 dmg in BRD. But he thinks that this amounts to pretty good dmg overall in terms of DPS. He also thinks that soloing as a panther would be the fastest, faster than a bear form. <br />
<br />
His current build: recovery (20 pts), beastiary (31 pts) for solo <br />
Instances/grouping: Recovery (29 pts), balance/harmony (22 pts) <br />
PvP (in groups): recovery (20), harmoney/balance (31 pts)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess i will have to wait till a website gets the talent tree for druids up, so I can play around with a final set, since the talent point reset guys in beta wont be in the live game, atleast it wont be as easy to wipe your talents and redo them to have different builds for each situtation</div></div><hr />

<br />
makes more sense<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda wondering about the self ressurection also....I mean what would be the point? Is it like a buff where we come back to life if we die? since it would be kinda pointless to res our self as a ghost....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, honestly I'm not sure exactly how useful a self res would be.  I mean of course it would totally rock for soloing, but its not going to help you out in group situations really.  <br />
<br />
I'll have to see the talent tree before I make any real calls on whether or not its worth it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, this is horrible really, but it gives you an idea of the druid talents:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenalyn</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Self-Res for Druids is like Self-Res for Warlocks - we don't really need it and to force us to waste talent points for it is stupid.  Now, if we were to pay 4g at level 50 or something, I can see purchasing it this way.  I rather just ghost like usual when soloing.<br />
<br />
Healing &amp; offensive spell talents are nice.  I think the &quot;weapon enchant&quot; thing is a waste.  I suppose whoever was in charge of Druid Talents couldn't come up with something good and said, &quot;whateva!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dieing to try out Hurricane! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cprender</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the weapon enchant thing is the best talent a druid can get almost. I have tried all of the trees, and some mixes and keep coming back to this single talent. When you hear that &quot;gong&quot; go off, and you get your flashing clearcast icon, its is pure bliss.  :blow:</div></div><hr />
