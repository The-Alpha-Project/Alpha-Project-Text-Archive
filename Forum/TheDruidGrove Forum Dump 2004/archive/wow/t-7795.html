I love bear form -- I have never been in a fight with it, But it just looks bad ass to me. <br />
<br />
I like the UI for the most part, it takes some getting use to. <br />
I like the Death system, you pay for a death in going back to find your body, or pay the cryptkeeper<br />
I like not much downtime (med time) in between fights, <br />
I love the tradeskill craftsman tag</div></div><hr />

It's a very cool trick, but that's really all it appears to be. (as it should be IMHO) You can offtank in an XP group lacking melees or in an emergency, pretty cool but hardly class defining. It appears to have no use solo or in a raid setting. Hopefully they will view it in that light, unlike the old argument against improving raiding Druids in EQ because they have Ensnare. (utterly useless in raids, but admittedly extremely powerful in groups/solo)</div></div><hr />
