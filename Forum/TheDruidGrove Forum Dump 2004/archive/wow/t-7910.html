The World of Warcraft servers are back up and are ready for you to connect and start downloading the new patch. The patch is approximately 800MB, so please be prepared for a sizable download. PLEASE NOTE that we?ll be doing some final tuning on the servers for several hours, so it?s likely that you will have finished downloading the patch before you?re actually able to log back on and start playing again. We?ll post another message here when the servers are ready for you to reconnect. For those of you who are interested in seeing what?s in store with this patch, we will be posting the patch notes here shortly. <br />
