It's not really accurate to think of the Scarlet Monastery as Endgame. We never intended for players to be stuck or hover at a level 39 level cap. That is a by-product of the game being in testing. Dungeons such as the Monastery are mid-level content that we expect you to level through in a relatively short period of time. <br />
<br />
We have a tremendous amount of high level content planned -- true high level content -- for solo players, groups and raids. None of that content is accessible to you in this Beta yet. <br />
<br />
One day you salty Beta testers are going to look back and laugh that you once considered the lowly Scarlet Monastery *endgame* content. <br />
<br />
As for too much low level content, well personally I don't think there is such a thing as *too much content*. I think the true problem would arise if people started running out of quests and had to grind exp for multiple nights before doing a new quest. <br />
<br />
Lastly, if the leveling is relatively painless in the lower levels, it encourages people to try out new races and classes and absorb the *entire* WoW experience, rather than just a small fraction of it. It's a lot of fun to log in a new character and run through completely different quests in completely different zones and be able to actually make meaningful progress. <br />
<br />
Don't worry, we have plenty of zones and dungeons slated for the high levels. We know players are going to spend a lot of time maxed out or close to max. We will provide them with plenty to do. Until then, enjoy the ride =)</div></div><hr />

I got the impression from other posts Blizzard has made that they definitely realize the need for an end game, but this is as plainly stated as I have seen it.</div></div><hr />

This is a cool philosophy.  I've always been one that liked to play a lot of different characters.  I might have a large stable of characters in this game!</div></div><hr />

But I love that Blizzard seems to be planning all this stuff in detail ahead of time, instead of bandaiding it later.</div></div><hr />
