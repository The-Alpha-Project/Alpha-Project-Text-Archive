Blizzard Entertainment's:  &quot;World of Warcraft (http://www.blizzard.com/wow)&quot;&lt;hr&gt;<br />
Game Play and Character Creation:<br />
<br />
If abilities are purchased with points via a skill-tree, will a character at max level have enough ability points to have all the abilities at useful (or max) levels, or just some? If only some, what sort of tradeoffs in other abilities will we see? <br />
<br />
Both the skill point system and the talent system are being iterated on. Each character will have to make choices as to which skills, tradeskills and abilities he chooses to specialize in. Players should be able to gain exposure to a wide variety of skills but no one character will be able to master all skills. Players also have the ability to forfeit skills in order to pursue other interests. --Tigole <br />
<br />
 <br />
You've stated that there will be encounters which require a &quot;guild&quot; size force. What is a guild size force? And will these encounters be the only means of getting the &quot;best&quot; gear, or will there be comparable gear available through other, more &quot;casual&quot; means (e.g., grouping, questing, etc.)? <br />
<br />
Currently, our thinking is raid encounters will be designed for a force of approximately 25-30 people. We feel that a number in this vicinity captures the epic feel of a raid while allowing each individual involved to play a significant role. The exact numbers are still up for debate though. There will also be a handful of &quot;world&quot; encounters that will require the server to band together and overcome a great foe. <br />
<br />
Some of the best items in the game will come from raiding. You will still be able to get great items through group encounters, quests and tradeskills. But the loot that drops off of raid bosses will definitely be highly sought after. -- Tigole<br />
<br />
<br />
How important will having and/or earning money be to gameplay? How can a character in the game earn cash (e.g., dropped coin from mobs or quests, sell back on dropped items, selling tradeskill-made items, etc.)? <br />
<br />
Money is very important in the World of Warcraft. Players need money to train skills and abilities, for tradeskills, reagents, extended bank space and vendor items such as weapons and armor. Money can be earned by killing creatures, selling back items to vendors or through the player trade economy. --Tigole<br />
<br />
<br />
 In current MMORPGs, the difficulty of instanced dungeons varies with the playing levels of the characters, but the look, style, and feel of the dungeons does not vary greatly. How will this be different in World of Warcraft?  <br />
<br />
Each of our instanced dungeons is tailor made for one level range. Early on we discussed re-using dungeons and swapping out creatures according to level range but we decided it would be more fulfilling for players to have new dungeons to experience rather than constantly returning to the same ones. Each of our instanced dungeons has a totally unique story and theme behind it. They are scattered throughout the world, on all continents and across all level ranges.  <br />
<br />
I think our four *newbie* dungeons stand as a good example of the variety of locations players will have to fight in. On Azeroth, the first dungeon experience will be the Deadmines, a full blown mining operation hidden within the hills of Westfall. In Lordaeron, players will adventure in Shadowfang Keep, a castle overrun with Worgen which were summoned by a deranged Archmage. On Kalimdor, Night Elf players will adventure in Blackfathom Deeps, an old sea temple infested with cultists and naga. Also on Kalimdor, Horde players will adventure in the Wailing Caverns, a lush, overgrown cave which is being terrorized by reptilian creatures summoned from a sleeping Druid's nightmares. These four examples are just the tip of the iceberg. These are the first four dungeons players will see. It only gets bigger and better from there =) -- Tigole<br />
<br />
<br />
Having options to pick from a variety of faces, builds, etc.. while creating your character is important to the players; is this issue being addressed?<br />
<br />
Yes it is.  Character customization has been given a high priority status for the design team.  It is being looked at carefully and the team is in the process of adding new ways for people to create unique characters. -- Katricia<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid Spells and Shifting abilities:<br />
<br />
Is shifting instant, or does it have a cast time? Can shifting be done while moving? Does shifting cost mana?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Shape shifting is done instantly with no casting time and can be done while moving.  The “cost” of shape shifting will vary depending on the form. -- Katricia<br />
<br />
<br />
Bear form is rumored to be a &quot;warrior&quot; form, Panther form is rumored to be a &quot;rogue&quot; form. What differences are there between a druid forms and the true classes? <br />
<br />
The bear and panther forms are truly subsets of the in-game classes but with unique abilities that will not be available to the classes, making them very unique in their own rights. -- Katricia<br />
 <br />
<br />
What other spells will be available to druids?  <br />
<br />
One new spell that has recently been added to our classes section is Mark of the Wild.  This spell is meant to really make the druids a valued part of any group.  It will give druids the ability to aid themselves and others by enhancing attributes.  At higher levels we anticipate this as being one of those buffs that everyone will be asking for. -- Katricia<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides appearance, what things change when shifting into a new form (e.g., in Warcraft 3, a druid shifting into bear form gains AC, melee damage, and hp, while losing mana regen)?  <br />
<br />
Things will definitely change for a druid once they have shape shifted into a new form.  For example, when in their aquatic form druids will swim faster and be able to breathe underwater, in bear form they will use rage much as a warrior would with the unique added ability to “roar” just like WarCraft III. -- Katricia<br />
<br />
<br />
Are stat modifiers and effects from worn equipment, potions, and similar items taken into account in shifted form? How does the weapon held prior to shifting affect the druid's damage in shifted form?  <br />
<br />
Oh yes, every item worn by the druid while shape shifted will still carry it’s effects after they’ve transferred.  For example, in bear shape the druid will be attacking with claws and teeth, but the speed and damage will come from their weapons with modifications added from their new found “bear” strength etc.   -- Katricia<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
 I, the Druid's Grove staff and the entire Druid's Grove community would like to express our deepest thanks and appreciation to Blizzard for responding to our questions about World of Warcraft, the druid class and game play. We are afraid, however, that is has only whetted our appetites for more! Congratulations to Blizzard for the huge interest in WoW and good luck with the beta launch!</div></div><hr />

Really no controversy atm, most people will be concerned with balance of each class as time goes on but w/o knowing exactly how each class will interact with each other there just isn't an argument at this time - which is great news for all players even if their interest peak in other directions as far as classes go. <br />
 <br />
My interest is strictly in the Druid class - I like playing the Druid persona.. no matter how the class is designed. The Warcraft Druid so far Looks like FUN. Taking from Tigole's comments on the  GameSpy Interview (http://www.gamespy.com/previews/january04/wowpc/) ..  'Am I having fun now?'  - all I can say is 'YES!' and I am not even playing the game yet!</div></div><hr />

I register to this forum just to post this message.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what I DIDNT want to hear!  It is like if some devs got a *brilliant* idea like this: &quot;Oh, I got a great idea, because Diablo is nicer and uberer then Warcraft, let give some of the best Warcraft units to folks that earn it in Diablo and only give great units to be earned in Warcraft!&quot;   :smoke: <br />
<br />
This is LAME!  If I play a grouping game, why do someone playing another game deserve to be better then me in grouping?  You are going where EQ have been and you will do the same mistake on this topic!  *sight*</div></div><hr />

D2 multiplayer was a real let down for me at first.. Besides that Anofayle is right, groups suck... do you know how hard it is to have 25 reliable ppl in a group? Me im a loner.. I like the druid concept, and whats the point of being alone in nature among the beasts if you cant fend for yourself... How about this... you can have the top notch equipment even if your all alone.. its just harder to aquire and takes forever... being in groups mearly speeds up the process..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as for MMO's where there is a huge difference in the player base.. currently in EQ we have to turn people away and we have 72/54 limits on our raids. As for Drops - when its only 3-4 drops and these items are for different class and or gear slots between 72/54 people and lets say 30 of those people need one of those items.. 20 of them need another one of those items.. then you have to go back &quot;how many times&quot; to kill the same mob.. which take a lot of time. Most raids - One event can take up to 4-6 hours a shot, thats one long night to have 3 items drop - Solo wise, I cannot see how you would expect the drops to compare with the drops (gear drops) during raids. <br />
<br />
Highly sought after items should require teamwork and community to even gain access to such items. - it be a pretty boring game w/o having friends and community to fall back upon during times of need.<br />
<br />
As for Druids being alone with nature.. after 5 years.. of being a Druid in MMO's (primarily a grouping one) .... I think I am finally getting the meaning of Tree-huggers... /blinks<br />
<br />
All joking aside - I understand where your coming from... I just can't agree with you. Traditionally speaking community, teamwork and friends keeps most entertained and when your dealing with a large audience of people.. the sense of community and teamwork .. works well for MMO's, of course having a chance at phat lewt drops in the end of a raid..  is the only reason to go back to kill it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scooma</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.. personally really hoping raid style play is restricted to specific encounters/events rather than evolving into an entirely separate style of play in it's own right where a player can and often will spend all his 'achieving' time raiding, like it has in EQ. The disparities it has caused in this game really dont need to be repeated again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elven-marksman</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">persoanlly I think doing the same raid iver and over again in a group is BORING.. i mean ppl who have jobs of repetitive tasks kill themselves, why would i want to do that in a game? Why wouldnt i want to explore/fight/kill and learn on my own? Personalyl im interested in seeing how factions work out. WIll be able to kill anyone form the other faction at any time? Will there be penalties? I think most online games like this shoudl leave thing up to violence an chaos.. UO sux because after awhile your just doing the same thing over and over, and its realy nothign more than a chat system will lil people.  Even if you could get a raiding [arty with 25+ ppl how often do you keep that party togeather long enough to do enough raids for everyone to get something unique? <br />
<br />
My point is this.. have raiding parties... but dont make the items gained from raiding parties so much more godly. Realy raiding parties should only speed up the process of getting good items.<br />
<br />
ps ty for such an imediate response... Im glad to see one so high up in this society taking notice of lil ol me..</div></div><hr />

Who knows - none of us do - The Gear that you can get in small groups maybe less then the Gear you can get in Raids.. but we do not know the disparity between the two as of yet. <br />
<br />
As for solo.. who knows.. what toys can be found.. not sure how big these zones are.. if you can even get lost in the woods and find yourself so to speak.. we will see.<br />
