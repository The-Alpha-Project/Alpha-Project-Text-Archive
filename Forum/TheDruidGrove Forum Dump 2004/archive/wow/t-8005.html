<br />
What questions do you have about the current or future state of druids?<br />
Questions about Druid Talents?<br />
Questions about the game in general?<br />
<br />
Post them here and I'll go through them and pass a list of questions on to Tyren and Caydiem.<br />
<br />
You might want to go through The Official Druid Forums (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/board.aspx?fn=wow-druid) over at the WoW site.  The TDG community may even have some answers for your questions before we even need to send them off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are there any plans to add a resurrection spell for druids?  If not, why not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there don't seem to be many questions, so here's another one...<br />
<br />
Will more druid-specific quests be added?  (E.g., quests to obtain the shapeshifting forms.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormrage</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't actually played WOW yet, I am not yet in the beta (though i plan to sign up for the open beta) and I want to know what class I should play.  The druids are my favourite, but right now it seems that they suck.  So these are just things I want to know, yet my opinion is kind of not as good as people who have played in the beta.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to the point:<br />
<br />
- What do devs think the Druids main purpose in a group is?  From what I've read, the forms don't even compare to their parent classes, and you can't heal or anything while in forms.<br />
<br />
- Are the Druids intended to have like 6 gears? (Str, Sta for bear, agi, sta for panther, int, spir for caster).  Or does Blizzard intend to make it migate somewhat?  (Like when you shift, have the spir, int switch to either str and sta or agl an sta for whatever form.)<br />
<br />
- Are horrible spells (for the effiecency per mana and talent points) like Tranquility and Hurricane going to be fixed? (to heal/damage more, less mana /talent points, etc.)<br />
<br />
- Is entangling roots going to be fixed?<br />
<br />
- Can thorns become an aura, like it was in WC3?<br />
<br />
That's all for now... but I might have more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say that until you have played it, hehe.  I have played 3 druids now, 1 almost 40 now, 1 past 30, another past 20.  They have all been a blast and I will defiantly be a druid at release.  Its far from sucking...you are getting your info from all the whiners on the WoW boards<br />

<br />
Again, why do people think we should really be on par with parent classes? we are mix..we should never been up to par with the parent classes...<br />

<br />
As you play, you will find that..you might not even like one of the forms.  Myself, cant stand the bear form.  Unless you are a die hard stat freak and changing forms alot(if thats the case, you prolly have armor suited for it)...you wont even need to worry about different sets of armor.<br />

<br />
Fixed?  They arent bad at all, like all AE spells they are goin to be mana costly.  The only problem I have with Tranquility is the 10 min cooldown, that is the only thing I could see that needs fixing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Is entangling roots going to be fixed?<br />
<br />
Whats wrong with it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Can thorns become an aura, like it was in WC3?<br />
<br />
This would just be another luxury feature.  Yes, it would be nice, but I havent played a game yet where damage shield buffs arent on a shorter duration of normal buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our root is a CC spell mainly..if the creature is hit at all my melee or spells, root has a good chance of breaking.  Unless the creature is more than 4 lvls above you, I havent had a problem at all using root.  Now I wouldnt mind seeing a talent maybe that reduced the chance of root breaking with damage.  Because rooting seems to be pretty high aggro, and usually once the group turns toward the rooted mob, he still hates you alot hehe<br />
<br />
On a similar note, Nature's Grasp in our talent tree is one fo the best talents to have in my mind. =)</div></div><hr />
