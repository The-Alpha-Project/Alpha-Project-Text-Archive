Since I play on PC and Notebook it's a pain to be switching, I'm a little forgetful.<br />
<br />
I'm curently playing City of Heroes and you don't need to put in the CD to play, is this the same for WoW?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I doubt it though the only reason you would need a cd to start a game is if it did not give the option for a full install.  The last MMO that had an option to not fully install that I know of was UO but they removed that option about 3 years ago.  It's just not feasible to have cd switching on zoning in mmo's.</div></div><hr />

The OB Client that everybody has IS the official client. You won't need to uninstall and reinstall come release. You'll just need to patch it.<br />
<br />
And as you may know, you don't need the CD for this client.</div></div><hr />
