<br />
In World of Warcraft, balancing for PvP situations (regardless of what server they are on) is done separately from balancing PvE situations. <br />
<br />
As an example, in a PvP setting a spell such as stun may be altered to stun the same targeted player less with each consecutive cast. That same change would not take place in a PvE situation. <br />
<br />
To further explain the example above: <br />
<br />
PvP: A player stuns another player for the first time, the duration of the stun will be at 100%. A player stuns the same player a second time; the duration of that stun will be 50% of what it was the first time. A player stuns the same player a third time and the duration of the stun will be 75% of what it was the first time. A player stuns the same player a fourth time and the targeted player is now immune to stun. <br />
<br />
PvE: A player can stun the monster/NPC over and over again without any change occurring. <br />

<br />
Now, I really like that response (besides the mis-ordered percentages having 50% and 75% swapped).  If blizzard is taking the approach of balancing PvP and PvE seperately in this manner it could really work... It almost makes you wonder why no one has done it this way in the past... possibly because it's twice the programming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is. EQ does this in a way as well, some spells don't work on players (charm), nukes only do % damage, resists work differently. DAOC also has this. No game can have their PvE work the same as PvP, mainly because fights would be brutal and short, and the mages would win every time lol.<br />
<br />
All in all, PvP is a waste of time in my opinion in MMORPG's. All that work balancing PvP (and no matter WHAT they WILL complain about X class being too good blah blah blah), could be put to much more useful things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you entirely that PvP is a waste of time for the most part, what made me happy was that the PvE won't be effected and the classes differences butchered for the sake of PvP alone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree.  I think balanced PvP in a MMORPG is a worthy goal.  There are plenty of pitfalls to avoid, but the benefits are substantial.  <br />
<br />
Human opponents add depth to a game.  Mob AI and event scripts may satisfy adventurers temporarily, but in MMOGs especially, where playtime is measured in days as opposed to hours, there's a fair amount of repetition.  Furthermore, there's a wealth of resources available online for those interested in maximizing their xp gain/time.  The result: go to camp, single pull, grind.  Or if you prefer raiding, get numbers, do buffs, clear trash, kill boss.  There are few surprises for the veteran PvE gamer, intimately familiar with the relatively simple mechanics of PvE combat.  PvP on the other hand, involves opponents who run when they realize they're overmatched, instead of at 20% life.  It involves stealth for the purposes of making surprise attacks, as opposed to simply bypassing content.  Smart PvPers use terrain and battlefield position.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, good PvP combat provides more opportunities for players to be heroes.  A good PvP system will encourage level-appropriate conflicts, allowing all players a chance at victory, without letting any one dimension of combat overshadow all others.  The fewer &quot;iWin&quot; buttons there are, the more exciting the conflict becomes.  Level, gear, consumables, class/race abilities, awareness and character control should each provide benefits, but deficiencies in some areas should balance advantages in others.  This delicate balance requires effort by the game developers, but if the devs get it right, the players will end up providing each other with months or years of fresh, challenging, memorable content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can thoroughly understand the satisfaction gained from beating a human opponent as opposed to a computer controlled one, as a human tends to be (in most occassions anyway) smarter and more skilled than any AI.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard really pulls off something wonderous with the PvP I may get into it again, but every other MMO i've played has screwed over perfectly good classes and differences for the sake of PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem: PvP is almost never about killing a worthy opponent in an epic battle. Its more of kill the person 20 levels lower than you. I've PvP'd in EQ (Sullon Zek), Shadowbane, Lineage 2, and probably some others I can't remember, and have NEVER had a fair fight one way or the other. So attempting to reach a goal that never happens is a fruitless endevour, one that wastes time and money that could be better spent on making the AI/combat/whatever more entertaining. <br />
<br />
If I want to kill players, I play WW2online (like I am right now) or Call of Duty. And you know what? Even in THOSE games, meant for PvP, they still cry and whine (sometimes with justification) about each others equipment, etc. They can't even achieve PvE balance, and piling PvP on top just makes things worse (Lineage 2, Shadowbane, DAOC prove this).</div></div><hr />
