&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt; After a few alpha revisions, we decided to break the work up into outdoor content for soloing, dungeons that offer cool loot and encourage grouping to succeed, and heavy boss encounters that require large guilds to take out.

Hehe, my crystall ball shows ongoing casual/uber debates for the next century ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?  It seems like they're trying to offer something for every type of player.  Whether it succeeds or not is another story.<br />
<br />
And everyone should just admit they love uber vs casual debates.  Why else would there be so many of them?</div></div><hr />

They made a choice of how everyone would have to progress at the high end that I personally dislike.   I'm afraid every other game in the genre is going to follow suit.   I certainly don't want to get sucked in, attached to my character, only to find out yet again that I can't progress.<br />
<br />
I'd happily exchange the debate for a character growth path.</div></div><hr />

How can you be so sure this will happen without actually playing EVERY game to that point.  Your basing conclusions on products which have not been released and ones which are not even thought of yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure, but I won't invest time in another game until I'm sure that's not going to be the case.</div></div><hr />

The market is getting large enough now to allow for more specilization I just hope that the publishers will allow that and not force the we gotta appeal to the masses and not allow the specialists to shine.<br />
<br />
Despite how much I disliked the idea of SB's PvP/PK/crush mindset, I liked the fact that it was marketed to the proper audience that way I could completly ignore the game and not try to find some part of it I would like that would hopefully make up for all the parts I didn't.</div></div><hr />
