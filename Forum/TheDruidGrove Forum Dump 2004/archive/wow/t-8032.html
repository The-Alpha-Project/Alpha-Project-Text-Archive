How many release dates has HL2 had?</div></div><hr />

Time will tell I guess :)</div></div><hr />

We appreciate everyone's interest in determining when World of Warcraft will ship, but while we are rapidly approaching the open beta period and we are confident that we will meet our goal of shipping the game before the end of this year, nailing down an exact ship date is a little more complicated due to a number of factors. As soon as we have a specific date to announce, we will be excited to share the news with everyone. Please don't consider any announced release dates official until such an announcement comes from Blizzard. This is true for all announcements related to Blizzard games. <br />

And they probably even have the internal release date set to that, but its still Blizzard, so I guess things could slip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, just idle speculation, but since EQ2 is shipping on November 8th, I suspect WoW open beta will start on or before that date.<br />
<br />
Maybe something like:<br />
<br />
Next Patch with pretty much everything thats still missing goes in on November 1st and Open Beta sign-ups start.<br />
Open beta starts on November 8th.<br />
Release on November 22nd/23rd.  <br />
<br />
*shrugs*  Who knows.  :)</div></div><hr />

The annoucement of open beta sign ups, open beta starting on Friday, the 5th for the weekend.  Then Sony crying that people are playing WoW and not EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">open beta is only supposed to be 2 weeks or so, just to test the load handling and stability of all the servers</div></div><hr />
