<br />
Details on the patch:<br />
<br />
We have become aware of a bug in our patching system that would have prevented future patches of the beta client from being delivered properly to all of our beta testers. In order to fix this, we need all beta testers to download a standalone patch. This patch will also allow us to test our standalone patching capabilities of the World of Warcraft beta client in case future updates need to be made via multiple methods, i.e. through the Blizzard Downloader, mirrored patch files, or by any alternate delivery systems.   <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Please make sure you have at least 3 GB of free space before you run this patch.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
For details on what balance changes have been made, please read the patch notes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch-8-17-04.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  To download the patch, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/WoW-0.9.1.zip&quot;&gt;PC users go here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/mac.zip&quot;&gt;Mac users go here&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;If you have difficulty installing the patch, please unzip the patch file to the same directory in which you have World of Warcraft installed and run it from there.&lt;/b&gt; PC users should have the patch file &quot;WoW-0.9.1.exe.&quot; Mac users should have the file &quot;WoW Mac 0.9.1 patch.dmg.&quot; If you experience difficulty installing the patch, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:wowtech@blizzard.com&quot;&gt;wowtech@blizzard.com&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
Edit: Updated info on patch problems!<br />
We have identified a bug with the standalone beta patch that beta testers with fewer than 3 gigabytes of free space on their hard drives encountered when attempting to install the patch. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?ForumName=wow-tech-support&amp;amp;ThreadID=17493&quot;&gt;Technical Support&lt;/a&gt; forum post here that describes the solution.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't appear to create one of the files correctly (patch.mpq) during the patching process on certain computers.  The true cause for this is not yet determined.<br />
<br />
I for one am making a copy of my WoW directory before installing the patch as it's already killed the WoW installation on my laptop.</div></div><hr />

They updated their site with info on that (and I just updated the news post); apparently it's messing up and deleting files if there isn't enough space.</div></div><hr />
