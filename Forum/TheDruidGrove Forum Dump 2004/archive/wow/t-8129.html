Their tracking system is kinda crappy, doesn't even given an ETA or anythig. But oh well, must think positive! Though, I won't even be playing until five tonight, just making characters real quick to reserve names. Person I play with has class tonight till five, blah!</div></div><hr />

I think their tracking is just behind, my new work computer was shipped 2nd day air and it's been sitting in Fort Worth since Saturday (supposed to be delivered today too).</div></div><hr />

Well, Amazon's site says the package is still scheduled to arrive today, but yet the order also hasn't shipped.  Something has got to give and it looks like it'll be the arrival date.  Barf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I'm excited.  This is the first time I've ever gotten into a game on the initial release day.  Living in the sticks, it's usually a few days before copies get out here.  So I'm happy ;)</div></div><hr />

I finnaly got mine, damn slow UPS =-p<br />

At least I don't have to worry about installing it!<br />

[Edit] I do have to worry about the 20 minute queue wait though.</div></div><hr />

And they don't plan to make anymore, so it will actually be a collectors item =-p</div></div><hr />
