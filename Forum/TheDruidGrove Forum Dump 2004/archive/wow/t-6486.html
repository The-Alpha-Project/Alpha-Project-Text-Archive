<br />
But yesterday that was sorely tested :)<br />
<br />
I was at work and she thought it would be a nice surprise to sign me up for the WoW beta, since she knew that I hadn't been able to sign in the night before.  But she did it from her computer which doesn't have the specs to run the game and apparently there's some ActiveX control that reads your information directly from the computer and links it to your beta account?<br />
<br />
So now I have a beta application with an inferior machine linked to it... and I have a feeling that will hurt my chances to get in.  Does anyone know if you can update that profile?<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm glad I didn't try to apply from work too and get completely disqualified, but this may be bad enough  :(</div></div><hr />

I think that if that machine was not capable, would it have not come back and said your machine is not suitable?<br />
<br />
just my thoughts!</div></div><hr />

Last night I got a response.  They said lots of people are having problems with this and they are allowing people to resubmit their application.  In the event of two nearly identical applications, they will take the latest one.<br />
<br />
So I re-applied on my correct machine.  /crossfingers</div></div><hr />

This reply is simply to annoy people much like the guy who owns a Ferrari never drives it over 30 miles an hour.</div></div><hr />

They are not interested on how well the  game runs for the king of the Overclockers.  They want to know how it is going to perform for a normal gamer with a current machine.<br />
<br />
If the machine you submitted does not meet requirements maybe there is a way you can resubmit.  I seem to remember in the SWG beta we could update our dxdiag info , etc whenever we wanted.</div></div><hr />
