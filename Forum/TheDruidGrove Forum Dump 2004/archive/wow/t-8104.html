<br />
The following is a partial list of changes planned for the upcoming patch. Thanks to all our players who gave us constructive feedback on these issues. <br />
<br />
--------------- <br />
<br />
-Spirit Healer <br />
<br />
Using the Spirit Healer now results in a 25% loss in durability for a player's equipped gear and items in inventory, instead of the previous 100% loss. The length of resurrection sickness suffered from using the Spirit Healer has also been decreased to a maximum of 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
-Durability <br />
<br />
Item durability costs have been greatly decreased for Superior (blue) and Epic (purple) items. <br />
<br />
<br />
-Improved Unstuck <br />
<br />
We’ve added an auto-unstuck feature that you can use prior to petitioning a GM. You can use this feature in situations where you are caught in a part of the terrain and cannot get out. You can find the unstuck option by clicking on the “Help Request” button found on the bottom right hand side of the user interface. <br />
<br />
<br />
-Reagents <br />
Reagent requirements have been removed from the following spells: <br />
Druid: Mark of the Wild <br />
Mage: Arcane Intellect <br />
Priest: Power Word: Fortitude <br />
<br />
<br />
-Warrior <br />
Defensive Stance has been improved to hold aggro more effectively. <br />
Taunt: removed rage cost and global cooldown. <br />
<br />
I'm so glad they're removing the reagent requirements from buffs, it took a good deal of the random acts of kindness away from the game.  It also spells out quite clearly that item durability loss to items in your pack is in fact intentional and not a bug.</div></div><hr />

Doh! <br />
<br />
Testers, I left out an important note. The patch that Ordinn is talking about is a small patch to address immediate player concerns. The PvP rewards will go into the regularly scheduled patch which will come after this one. <br />
<br />
