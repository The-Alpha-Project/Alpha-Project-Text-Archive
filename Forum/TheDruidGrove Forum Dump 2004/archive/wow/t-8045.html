In anticipation of the World of Warcraft Open Beta Test, we will be shutting down our Battle.net World of Warcraft forums. The shutdown is expected to happen sometime this week. <br />
<br />
If you have any posts you wish to keep, please save a copy of them on your computer. The Battle.net World of Warcraft forums have been a lot of fun to read and manage, and we would like to thank you for making them your home over the last few years. World of Warcraft players can continue to post on our official World of Warcraft forums at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/forums/ . <br />
