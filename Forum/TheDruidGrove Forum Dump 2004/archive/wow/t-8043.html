World of Warcraft® Final Stress Test FAQ <br />
<br />
What is the final stress test? <br />
The final stress test is an additional phase of testing that the developers have deemed necessary in order to prepare the game for open beta. Those who play in the final stress test will be helping to finalize the game code so that it is ready for deployment in the open beta phase. <br />
<br />
Will I have full access to the World of Warcraft game? <br />
The version of the game in the final stress test will be very similar to the closed beta version, and will include nearly all of the content that will be in the game for the open beta. However, because the game is still being optimized, there may be some lag and performance issues. Please bear with us and remember that although you will be playing a version that seems very polished and complete, it is in fact a stress test and will not always play optimally. <br />
<br />
If I was in the first stress test beta, will I get to reuse my old account and characters? <br />
Because we are testing a new version of the game and account creation process, we will need you to create a new account and new characters to play in the final stress test. Additionally, because the final stress test is a new version of the game, all accounts and characters from the first stress test beta would have been incompatible with the final stress test and were thus deleted. <br />
<br />
Are you charging people to play the final stress test? <br />
Blizzard is not charging a fee to play the final stress test or the open beta. However, to help defray the costs associated with distributing a large number of files and to keep our focus on finalizing World of Warcraft, we have partnered with FilePlanet for the distribution of the final stress test client, which is only available to FilePlanet subscribers. Subscription to FilePlanet carries with it a nominal fee. <br />
<br />
Once the final stress test is over, will I be able to play in the open beta? <br />
If you participate in the final stress test, your account will automatically be carried over to the open beta. You do not need to take any action. Instead, when the final stress test ends, you will be able to continue playing by logging into the open beta servers. <br />
<br />
Will I get to carry my characters from the final stress test to the open beta? <br />
Yes. If you play in the final stress test, your characters and account will simply transfer to the open beta. <br />
<br />
Will you charge people to play the open beta? <br />
No, the World of Warcraft open beta is absolutely free. Blizzard is not charging a fee for you to play the open beta. <br />
<br />
What is the open beta? <br />
As World of Warcraft gets closer to completion, we will need to conduct one last phase of beta testing for final balancing and bug fixing. This phase of testing is the open beta. Many final aspects of the game are being implemented in their most complete form in the open beta, and we will need this time to test these elements as rigorously as possible to ensure that they are completed for the game’s launch. <br />
<br />
When does the World of Warcraft final stress test begin? <br />
The final stress test begins on November 1, 2004. <br />
<br />
How will I know if I get into the final stress test? <br />
You will be contacted by e-mail letting you know that you do indeed have a spot in the final stress test. <br />
<br />
How long will the final stress test last? <br />
The exact duration of the World of Warcraft final stress test is undetermined, but we expect that it will last for approximately five to seven days. <br />
<br />
Do I need to sign up for the final stress test before it starts? <br />
No, there are no early signups. When the final stress test begins, signups for it will open at the same time. <br />
<br />
Can I sign up for the stress test if I am not a FilePlanet subscriber? <br />
The final stress test is only available to FilePlanet subscribers. However, the open beta phase will begin shortly after the final stress test ends, and is available to anyone with an Internet connection. <br />
<br />
Will I be able to start playing right away? <br />
Yes. After you sign up, you will receive an email confirmation soon thereafter containing your authentication key and instructions for downloading the World of Warcraft client and creating an account. After you follow those steps and create an account, you can log into the game and begin playing. <br />
<br />
What do I do with my authentication key? <br />
Your authentication key is needed to verify your acceptance into the final stress test. You will be asked to provide this key during the account-creation process. <br />
<br />
Will I need to connect to the Internet to play? <br />
Yes, you need to connect to the Internet to take part in the World of Warcraft final stress test. <br />
<br />
Will there be a Mac version of the final stress test available? <br />
Yes. This final stress test is for both Mac and PC users. <br />
<br />
Who can participate in the final stress test and open beta test? <br />
The final stress test and open beta are available for players in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. <br />
<br />
I’m having issues with the game – whom do I contact? <br />
Please use the support options located at www.worldofwarcraft.com/support. <br />
<br />
I’m having trouble with my authentication key. Whom do I contact? <br />
If you are having trouble with the delivery of your authentication key, please contact the FilePlanet Customer Support Team. If you are having trouble setting up the World of Warcraft stress test beta, make sure you are entering your key correctly. If you are having any trouble with the game, please contact Blizzard Technical Support. <br />
<br />
What are the system requirements? <br />
<br />
Windows® System 98/ME/2000/XP OS: <br />
<br />
800 MHz or higher CPU. <br />
<br />
256 MB or more of RAM. <br />

<br />
What is the open beta? <br />
As World of Warcraft gets closer to completion, we need to conduct another phase of beta testing for final balancing and bug fixing. This phase of testing is the open beta. Many final aspects of the game are being implemented in their most complete form in the open beta, and we will need this time to test these elements as rigorously as possible to ensure that they are completed for the game’s launch. <br />
<br />
Will you charge people to play the open beta? <br />
No, the World of Warcraft open beta is absolutely free. Blizzard is not charging a fee for you to play the open beta. <br />
<br />
Will I have full access to the World of Warcraft game? <br />
Since our goal is to have as much of the game balanced and tested as possible, you will be able to play the most current version of World of Warcraft. However, because the game is still being optimized, you may experience some lag and performance issues. Please bear with us and remember that although you will be playing a version that seems very polished and complete, it is in fact a beta and will not always play optimally. <br />
<br />
Do I have to play in the final stress test if I want to play the open beta? <br />
No, you do not have to play in the final stress test to participate in the open beta. However, if you wish to play in the open beta, you will have to wait until its start is announced, and then visit www.worldofwarcraft.com to begin downloading the open beta client and creating an open beta account. <br />
<br />
I don’t want to sign up for the final stress test. Can I sign up for the open beta now instead? <br />
Once the open beta starts, Blizzard will make an announcement on www.worldofwarcraft.com. At that time, you will you be able to download the World of Warcraft client and begin the account creation process. Once that is completed, you can start playing the open beta. <br />
<br />
How is the open beta different from the final stress test? <br />
The open beta will begin after the conclusion of the final stress test and will be the most complete version of the game available to date. It will include the content from the closed beta and final stress test, as well as additional features that are slated to appear in the final version of World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
Do I need to go through FilePlanet to get into the open beta? <br />
FilePlanet does indeed have a role in hosting the open beta, and it has a number of open beta accounts to award. However, the majority of open beta accounts will be distributed by Blizzard directly. Once FilePlanet’s accounts are given away, all further accounts will be awarded only through Blizzard. So, if you visit FilePlanet and are told that no more open beta accounts are available there, please go to www.worldofwarcraft.com to secure your open beta slot. <br />
<br />
Do I have to be a FilePlanet subscriber to sign up for the open beta at FilePlanet? <br />
No. Anyone with an Internet connection in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States can visit FilePlanet or Blizzard on the day the open beta begins to try to acquire an open beta account. Please note that FilePlanet has a number of open beta accounts to award, but if it exhausts its allotment of keys, you will still be able to visit www.worldofwarcraft.com for a chance to join the open beta. <br />
<br />
If I was in the stress test beta, will I get to reuse my old account and characters? <br />
Because we are testing a new version of the game and account-creation process, we will need you to create a new account and new characters to play in the final stress test. Additionally, because the final stress test is a new version of the game, all accounts and characters from the first stress test beta would have been incompatible with the final stress test and were thus deleted. <br />
<br />
If I am in the final stress test, will I get to transfer my account and characters from there to the open beta? <br />
Yes, you will be able to use your account and characters in the open beta. You do not need to take any action. Instead, when the final stress test ends, you will be able to continue playing by logging in to the open beta servers. <br />
<br />
Will I get to keep my characters from the open beta? <br />
We are still formulating our plans for the characters from the open beta and will provide more information in the near future. <br />
<br />
When does the open beta start? <br />
The open beta will begin immediately after the final stress test ends. An exact date is undetermined at this time; however, we expect the open beta to begin approximately five to seven days after the start of the final stress test. <br />
<br />
What do I do exactly to get started in the open beta? <br />
Once the open beta starts, visit www.worldofwarcraft.com for further instructions and information on the open beta. <br />
<br />
How do I get the open beta if I signed up through FilePlanet? <br />
If you go to FilePlanet to sign up for the open beta when it begins, you will be given an authtentication key and instructions to download the World of Warcraft client from FilePlanet. Please note that FilePlanet has a limited number of keys to award. <br />
<br />
What do I do after I download the World of Warcraft client? <br />
After you install World of Warcraft onto your computer, launch the program to be taken to the account-creation site. During the account-creation process, you will be prompted to enter the authentication key that will have been provided to you. After you successfully create your account, you can re-launch World of Warcraft and begin playing in the open beta. <br />
<br />
How long will you leave the World of Warcraft client up for download? <br />
Once we have achieved the maximum number of players for the open beta, we will remove World of Warcraft from download. So, if you wish to play in the open beta, we recommend that you download the client and create an account as soon as the open beta begins. After we have reached the maximum server population we need, we will no longer be accepting people into the World of Warcraft open beta. <br />
<br />
Will there be a limit to the number of people who can play the World of Warcraft open beta? <br />
Yes, we will have to limit the number of players. However, a maximum number of players has not yet been determined. At this time, we simply recommend that if you wish to play in the open beta that you download the game and create an account as soon as the open beta is ready. Once we fill our servers to capacity, we will remove the World of Warcraft downloader and account-creation pages. <br />
<br />
How will I know if I get into the open beta? <br />
If you can download the client and create an account, then you are in the World of Warcraft open beta. After creating an account, you must enter the account name and password you had chosen during the account creation process at the World of Warcraft login screen to play the game. <br />
<br />
How long will the open beta last? <br />
There is no predetermined duration for the World of Warcraft open beta. As long as we need to conduct further testing, we will maintain the open beta. <br />
<br />
Will I be able to start playing right away? <br />
Yes. When we announce the beginning of the open beta, you will be able to download the game immediately. After creating an account, you will be able to play World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
Will I need to connect to the Internet to play? <br />
Yes, you need to connect to the Internet to take part in the World of Warcraft open beta. <br />
<br />
Will there be a Mac version of the open beta available? <br />
Yes. The final stress test and open beta test are for both Mac and PC users. <br />
<br />
Who can participate in the final stress test and open beta test? <br />
The final stress test and open beta are available for players in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. <br />
<br />
Why can’t players in other countries participate in the final stress test and open beta test? <br />
The final stress test and open beta test are being conducted for the North American launch servers. We will eventually be conducting open beta tests in Europe and other regions in which we have announced the game’s upcoming availability. <br />

Meanwhile within 15 minutes of Blizz announcing this the fileplanet website became unreachable...</div></div><hr />

<br />
anytime you have a 2.6g download, there is going to be slow downs.<br />
<br />
At release you will have CDs and wont have to download this mouch</div></div><hr />

Mwahahaha, make that right on/just before EQII releases. :vampire:  :whistle:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope so!  EQ2 rushed out the door to beat WoW; it would be great if WoW did their open beta the day before EQ2's release  :dance: <br />
<br />
Finally got a link to a .torrent and got the 2.6G client downloaded last night - my withdrawal is alleviated for now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did you get in game with the client you downloaded from the torrent? a few of my guildies apparently downloaded a renamed 0.12.0 client instead of the 1.01 client</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I got it from the torrent - somebody over at Graffe's put it up in a good .torrent server and I got it in just a few hours as opposed to the 24+ hours it usually takes to get a patch from Blizzard<br />
<br />
On a side note... I really really hope they change their patching system after release - this torrent system is a pain the way they choke your download rate so much :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you will find once you log in the game will patch itself using an entirely different method (a REAL patching method). We'll soon see how well that works when they release the patch with all the talents and game updates in the next few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">which is of course why they're holding the patch, to see how it goes in a few days with lots of people... they stated they will also have alternative download methods after release, they know the alternatives work and the issues with them, they want to sort out the issues with their torrent system during beta.</div></div><hr />
