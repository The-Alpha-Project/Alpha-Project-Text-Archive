<br />
Blizzard has talked about a rock paper scissors system but the druid defies this by being a bit of everything. <br />
<br />
If a druid saw a mage they would go cat form and backstab it to death. If it saw a warrior it would entangle it and so on the druid can always use the right form on the right opponent.</div></div><hr />

And the forms don't let you regain mana  I guess, and are huge mana sinks, so if you do switch into a form, you'll be nearly OOM once you leave it (That's what I've gathered from reading the beta forums).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Half the posters on the beta forums don't know what they're talking about.  Shapeshifting takes about half a mana bar, and provides some real benefits.  I think the first poster is right, the druid is extremely versatile in combat.  Bear and Cat forms are melee forms, complete with abilities and enhanced stats.  EQ porcupining fans will love watching ac/hps go up when transforming to a bear: at my level, I get about 50% more hps and an extra 60% ac.<br />
<br />
Besides an occasional duel with guildmates, I was never really interested in PvP in EQ.  WoW has a different atmosphere; it seems like PvP will be a lot more integrated, and fun.  As druids, we should strive to master our abilities in all scenarios, PvP included :)<br />
<br />
PvE, I usually solo in normal form:<br />
--------------------------------<br />
Pull with nuke (if it isn't likely to get resisted)<br />
Instant DD/Dot before engaging<br />
AC/Anti-stealth debuff<br />
Melee maintaining Rejuvenation (instant cast HoT) on self<br />
Moonfire (the instant cast DD/DoT) can be mixed in as mana permits, to speed up the fight.<br />
<br />
PvP I'd probably use less nukes, and save mana for healing:<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
Lead with Faerie Fire if it'll stick (AC/Anti-stealth debuff)<br />
Melee with Rejuv<br />
<br />
If you want to switch up styles, hit yourself with a HoT, pop a heal potion if you need to, and then shapeshift.  You may not be able to use items while shapeshifted, but the refresh timers on stuff like heal potions will keep ticking.</div></div><hr />

If there is sum weak rogue just bear form him. And against warrior, nuke 'em  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">05-09-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far as a Druid - Pals are pretty hard to fight against and &quot;rogues&quot; put out a high amount of damage and stealth is really stealth.. IE to the player (tho the old talent system gave u the ability to have a chance to see stealth players/NPCs).<br />
 <br />
 I own warriors no problem - as for other classes such as Necro's/Mages - I haven't tried yet.. I imagine since a druid basically has a hard time against casters (NPC's) and all the resist are not in the game yet.. I probably be owned pretty fast since spells interupt other spells (IE: get hit by a spell it interupts the one your casting. To Note: You continue to cast, it just cycles down so the time to cast your spell takes longer.. you don't actual have to recast the spell unless you get stunned.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my hope is that you can direct your druid towards being more effective through the talent system, give yourself better unarmed fighting etc and it effects the bears damage output etc.  Either way, i'm sure a resourceful druid PvP'er would be able to at least match any opponent as the combat in WoW seems to take some sort of skill/thought/timing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 22 rogue challenged me to a duel recently, and I accepted his offer.  I had a couple fairly significant advantages, one being my level: 25, two being my pack full of potions available to an alchemist.  I used a potion of Defense before the fight, along with self buffs.  His main advantage was PvP experience, since this was my first duel, and he had fought many more.<br />
<br />
For the first round, I stayed in normal form.  I led with faerie fire, with moonfire, melee and rejuv for the rest of the way.  He kept dancing and chasing me, but as the fight wore on, his hps dropped steadily.  I popped a healing potion towards the end, and when he died I was at 90% life.  First lesson: instant cast spells are godly!  Rejuv does not get interrupted.  Moonfire is a decent way of adding damage.<br />
<br />
For the second round, I decided to try out bearform.  I was still selfbuffed + defense potion.  I was a bit better at facing him throughout the fight.  This time I didn't have Rejuv or my healing potions, but still won the duel with about 50% life.  I used Demoralizing Roar followed by Bash and Maul.  I didn't use Enrage to generate rage, since I figured the 75% AC hit would outweigh any potential benefits.  My DS did quite a bit of damage, since the rogue was dual wielding low-delay weapons.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think druids are fairly well equipped to deal with rogues.  Had my opponent been a few levels higher, things might have gone differently since level plays a large role in the current combat system.  Lessons learned (some are rogue specific) :<br />
- Keep Rejuvenation up<br />
- Don't bother with spells with cast times (I nearly died trying to cast Regrowth)<br />
- Dogfighting skills are especially important, you don't want to expose your back<br />
- Potions Rawk!  I love alchemy.  Between healing potions and stat buffs, I've narrowly escaped death more times than I've died</div></div><hr />
