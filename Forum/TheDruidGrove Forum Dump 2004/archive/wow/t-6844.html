<br />
Yes there is. The snake lady is Queen Azshara. It would take too long for me to explain it so I'll quote from another source:<br />
<br />
   Ten thousand years before the orcs and humans clashed in their First War, the world of Azeroth had only one massive continent - surrounded by the infinite raging seas. That landmass was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival among the savage elements of the waking world. At the continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies. The lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark Beyond, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies across the world to nourish life in all it's wondrous forms. <br />
<br />
    The shimmering power drew the greatest tribe in the land, a race called the Kaldorei. These ancient people named the great land Kalimdor and settled near the vortex of cosmic energy. After several ages spent in peace and learning, the Kaldorei grew in power and wisdom so that they soon outstripped the other humanoid races of Azeroth. <br />
<br />
    The Well of Eternity was key to the Kaldorei's advancement. This connection did not come without a price, ultimately both beneficial and malevolent. In studying the Well's energies, the Kaldorei were infused with its power, becoming immortal and gleaning mastery, over the creatures of the land. In time, they learned to manipulate the powerful energies directly. Thus did the study of arcane magic begin. <br />
<br />
    Some Kaldorei believed that abusing the Well's arcane energies could only lead to ill, but their words of caution were ignored as their brethren flew headlong into the study of magic. Their greatest wizard's and sorcerers built beautiful cities, crafted amazing magical devices, and reshaped their world to better suit their needs. One of the greatest of their sorcerers was Azshara, a gifted woman who seemed to know more about magic than anyone alive even though she never studied a single treatise on the subject - as if she understood magic at it's most primal level. Before long, Azshara was crowned the Sorceress-Queen of Kalimdor. She gathered about her the Highborne, those Kaldorei of the upper classes who most reveled in magic. The Highborne soon acted as Azshara's chosen sect and venerated her as a goddess.<br />
<br />
The mighty Highborne became haughty and decadent as they grew in power. Unknown to them, their abuse of and obsession with the Well's otherworldly energies attracted the attention of a terrible race of creatures that fed upon magic. The beings, demons of the Burning Legion, dwelled in an extraplanar reality called the Twisting Nether. Sensing the sudden bloom of magical energies of Azeroth, these demons were drawn to Kalimdor like flies to a corpse. The barrier between realities kept the demons from feeding directly upon the Well's energy. Not to be denied, Sargeras, the dark titan and lord of the Burning Legion, exerted an unholy influence upon the nobles of Kalimdor. As Sargeras began his subtle manipulations, his lieutenants Archimonde the Defiler and Mannoroth the Destructor prepared the infernal minions to strike. <br />
<br />
    Queen Azshara and her Highborne servitors, overwhelmed by the terrible ecstasy of magic, fell victim to Sargeras' undeniable power. To show their allegiance, the Highborne aided their queen in opening a portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity. Though insufficient to allow Sargeras entry, it was enough for the Burning Legion to begin its assault. <br />
<br />
    The warrior-demons stormed through the Well of Eternity and laid siege to the night elves' sleeping cities. Led by Archimonde and Mannoroth, the Legion swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor, leaving only ash and sorrow in it's wake. The demon warlocks called down the searing Infernals that crashed like hellish meteors into the graceful spires of Kalimdor's temples. A band of burning, blood-letting killers called the Doomguard marched across Kalimdor's fields, slaughtering everyone in their path. Even packs of wild, demonic stalkers ravaged unopposed across the country side. <br />
<br />
    Nature rose up in shock and anger against this violent intrusion from beyond. The seas roiled as demonfire rained from the skies. The Kaldorei were shaken enough from their arcane haze to recognize the severity of this threat. They did what they could, but the Burning Legion was the manifestation of destruction. Cities were blown apart like fallen leaves, and the night elves were pushed back as the demons savaged their once idyllic realm. <br />
<br />
 It fell to a young Kaldorei scholar, Malfurion Stormrage, to find salvation for his people. Malfurion had long felt incensed by the growing corruption among the upper class. His own brother, Illidan, practiced the Highborne's magic, but Malfurion convinced him to forsake his dangerous obsession and help battle the invaders. The young priestess Tyrande Whisperwind agreed to accompany the brothers. <br />
<br />
    The three heroes met with the reclusive demi-god Cenarius, who brought the aid of the powerful dragons. Led by the great red leviathan Alextrasza, the dragonflights agreed to engage the demons while Malfurion looked for a way to banish them from the world. <br />
<br />
    Malfurion was convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons' umbilical link to the physical world and insisted that it should be destroyed. As the Well was also the source of the night elves' immortality and powers, his companions were shocked by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory and helped convince Cenarius and their dragon comrades to storm Azshara's temple. <br />
<br />
    Illidan was unnerved at the thought of never again wielding magic... and resentful that Tyrande had chosen romance with his brother rather that himself. Fear and jealousy curdled as Illidan vowed to protect the Well's power by any means necessary. <br />
<br />
    Malfurion found his brother missing, but assumed only that he could not face the thought of destroying the Well. Though heartbroken by Illidan's departure, Malfurion was committed to his course. The Highborne were in the midst of summoning Sargeras when Malfurions's forces struck, but they were far from surprised. Illidan had already whispered to Azshara of the plan, and she unleashed her mighty powers upon the attackers. Tyrande fell even as she made to strike the mad queen, sending Malfurion into a murderous rage. The battle between Malfurion and Azshara threw the Highborne's carefully crafted spellwork into chaos. The vortex within the Well's depths spun out of control and the Well of Eternity collapsed upon itself. <br />
<br />
    With its link to the Well severed, the burning Legion was flung back into the primal chaos from whence it came. In the ages that followed, they would become the stuff of legend. <br />
<br />
The seas rushed in to fill the gaping wound left by the Well's implosion. Kalimdor was sundered into a handful of separate continents surrounded by the new, raging sea. At the center of the new sea, where the Well of Eternity once stood, was a tumultuous storm of tidal fury and chaotic energies that came to be called the Maelstrom. It stood throughout the passing of centuries as a chilling testament to the terrible cataclysm that forever shattered the utopia once enjoyed by the night elves. <br />
<br />
There really wasn't anyway to shorten the lore anyway down, so I apologise for this long, long quote from http://wow.warcraftstrategy.com.<br />
Anyway, Queen Azshara and her followers were struck with a curse that changed their forms into serpents. They called themselves the Naga and vowed to return and take over the surface world. It was revealed in a book released that Queen Azshara still lived, oh so many years after the Sundering of the World. <br />
In the picture, the circle behind her could represent the Maelstrom.</div></div><hr />
