Sorry if they're kinda crappy quality, more than kinda crappy machine right now =-p (Hopefully going to build a whole new one soon, wee!)<br />

For those who don't know, the major cities were being attacked by the Burning Legion. The latest wave on Stormwind that I was at had 4-5 Doomguards, 1-2 Infernals, and lead by a Dreadlord. I know Brill had some Infernals too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuin</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were reports of the Burning Legion in Ogrimmar and Ironforge as well :-) I have some screenshots, and will put them up soon (I need to go through them and pick out the good ones). A number of us also formed two raids and hit Horde lands for some PvP fun. My computer was rather unhappy with me with that many people (oh, the lag!), but I think that was the most fun I've had in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, all the main cities were under attack at one point or another. As well as a number of towns. I did all my PvPing the day before yesterday.. got kind of tired of how stupid it was. 20 vs 3 and corpse camping.. yea.. real challenging there ace. Should have expected it really, but eh. Was a little more fair some time before that.. but once the three of us headed up into alliance lands it was just silly =-p <br />
<br />
But we did head into the Dead Mines after and pretty much own it. Everyone but me died on Vancleef, when he summons the adds. I managed to finished the last sliver of life off, and win the roll on the cloak. Beautiful cloak.. so need to get one like it here on release =-p Down to the knees, grey, with kind of deep red, and gold trim.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Was on my orc hunter during that time, he's kinda fun, but doubt I'll bother with a hunter on release.. not very wanted in groups late game, and pets scale very poorly. In the screenshot is my little newbie level 5 paladin I made to check out the class real quick before beta was over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuin</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's kinda funny...I grouped with some friends and tried Vancleef the day before *grin* The group was a 22 druid (me), a 17 warrior, 18 hunter, and 22 hunter. Needless to say, we didn't win, but it was a ton of fun. Grats to you on the win and the cloak (although you'll have to try the event again in retail)!<br />
<br />
I had a few horde camping my corpse at the end of the night tonight, and I agree--I wasn't impressed with their strategy. However, since this was my first foray into PvP, I still enjoyed myself. I think the thing that made my night was that I ran into a friend while she was playing her Tauren hunter, and had fun chasing her around and tagging her (and vice versa) ;-)<br />
<br />
Edited to add my one good shot of the mob spawns--<br />

Though I saw several horde players bodies dead in the elven land :D<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing some screenies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I missed out on it too.  By the time I logged in, the UnderCity was clogged with corpses, but nothing going on.  I just hung out, did a couple quests with my Undead Rogue and then let the world end quietly ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you haven't read them yet, I highly suggest the Warcraft series of books by Richard Knaak (Day of the Dragon and the War of the Ancients series).  The War of the Ancients series, especially, takes you back in Warcraft's history when the Burning Legion first attempted to conquer Azeroth.  The story really helps hit home how destructive the Infernals were, and why they're so cool :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solstas</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those books are awesome, Stormhaven.  I have read all of the first one (was free with my WoW preorder), and as soon as I finished I ran out and bought the 2nd.  I'm about 2/3 through it, and I'm already checking for release dates on the 3rd, and seeking out other books by him.<br />
<br />
If you have any interest at all in the lore behind some of the names you hear tossed around (Iliand, Tyrande, Malfurion, Rhonin, etc) you should definately check them out.<br />

I think ViniVidiVici's comments in that screenshot pretty much echoes what others would say in that situation.  Not sure if he was talking about that mob (probably not since it's the General channel) but it's fitting to be in that shot  :lmao:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuin</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree...the books are great for lore and history. I differ in opinion, however, in that I didn't really think they were an awesome read. Not to be disrespectful of others' opinions by stating that; I guess the author isn't my cup of tea or something :)</div></div><hr />

But yeah... seeing that thing in Razor Hill was a %@$!# moment. :)<br />

I swear EBGames had that offer, but not seeing it on there now.. blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you go to Best Buy, the pre-order box has the book inside of it.  No idea about internet buy-and-pick-up items though.  I think the freebies are a store-by-store offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, not seeing that you get the extra book with the CE on the BestBuy site.. wanted to just pre-order it online, so I could get it easier/sooner. Generally I get it delivered to my door an hour or three before the stores get it delivered/on the shelves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah well, will just have to order the CE from EB online, they arn't taking preorders for the CE at the store anymore. Will just have to buy the book series from Barnes and Nobles or something =-p</div></div><hr />
