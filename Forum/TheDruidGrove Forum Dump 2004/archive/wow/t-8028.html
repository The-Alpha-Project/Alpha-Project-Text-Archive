<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the talents trees and playing around with different builds and playing with talents up to lvl 35, I have thought of some of the talents I would label as a must have:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nature's Grasp with 4 points in Improved - Unless you go with the wrath talent you will most likely have this as your first 5 points in balance.  This buff is a great crowd control buff, specially when you have it up to 100%, also great from just extra damage for free pretty much if the root stays.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nature's Focus - 60% chance to avoid interuption with healing spells...this would have to top the list as #1 must have, this will make your soloing 200% easier.  Every druid i think should spend 10 points in Restoratoin just for this talent<br />
<br />
<br />
Omen of Clarity - Nothing like a 100% free heal, tranquilty, starfire, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well thats my list...feel free to post what you think is a must have.  I am more Balance/Restoration oriented, I shapeshift but not enough to waste talent points for any of the stuff, so I am sure there is prolly some Feral must haves.</div></div><hr />
