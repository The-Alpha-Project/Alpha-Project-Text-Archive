In theory, you should hit it with http://www.worldofwarcraft.com or .net, but some people's dns hasn't updated(like mine) in which case, here is the direct address:  http://12.129.232.213/<br />

The server on the worldofwarcraft.com site is reading a player count, and an email was sent to the alpha testers asking them to grab the beta client downloader and download the client to test the delivery.<br />

Looks like it'll be this week, possibly around friday</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, they are probably working weekends anyways, but still, the managers who don't, don't want to come in ;).<br />
<br />
My best guess would be tuesday-wednesday next week. And then they'll only invite, say, 100 people for a few weeks.</div></div><hr />
