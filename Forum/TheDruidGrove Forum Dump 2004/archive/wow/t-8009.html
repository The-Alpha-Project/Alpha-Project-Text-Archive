I'm only level 19 (almost 20), but I already see what other people are saying. With the right talent build, a druid makes quite a good healer. But not having rez means that you are much more likely to be passed over for an instance group as primary healer.<br />
<br />
The top of my list of concerns (they aren't really questions) are rez and being able to use root indoors. <br />

Yea...I like the root idea...atleast in caves and stuff..but not in a castle or stockades, etc</div></div><hr />

If you put res as a high level talent, well for starters that becomes the &quot;required&quot; talent tree as you'd have to pump points into it, and any druid who doesn't won't be welcome.<br />
<br />
Giving druids a spell like res takes away any versatility we have, it doesn't add to it, we'd be pigeon holed into healers for life, and honestly, other than occassionally being the secondary healer, that's just not my idea of fun.</div></div><hr />

And then you can apply the same argument to just about every other class in game. Why should a druid get it and not, say, a paladin? Or even a rogue?</div></div><hr />

Rezing on druids just seems dumb to me... they can already be a warrior, rogue and several other things plus they can get advantages in certain areas with the different forms, like the water one for example you don't run out of breath easy.  I haven't played a druid but they sound pretty powerful to me, why give em rez, so they are unstopable?  <br />

Take a look at the classes and decide what suits you, do not demand that the programmers cater to your wants.  If they did what everyone demanded then WoW would never see the light of day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, druids are decent warriors, rogues and healers, we by no means match our counterparts in the designated roles for those classes, it's the downside of being so versatile.  The main reason people are asking for res isn't so that they can be unstoppable, it's so that they get invited to groups more often.  I find as my druid i have no problems getting into groups, but then again, i'm in a very large guild.</div></div><hr />

I am playing a Druid in Alpha-the current beta test....  lvl 41 atm, but a good 20+ days spent.  I disagree with you about healing... I can do about 20 full heals and them i'm out of mana, and I can do very good in a simple group of two... rogue + me, warrior + me, warlock + me... I can do some DPS, and they can tank/dps, while I heal them.. me and a lvl 41 rogue were doing lvl 50 quests together, just yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, it's not really about being a powerhouse or even getting groups, as I'll be playing with friends and we'll likely have a set group.  It's more about convenience and not having to take 10-20 minutes to run back to the instance.  I like the versatility a druid brings, but the lack of rez is a real drawback to me.  I'm considering playing a paladin with my friends instead (priest/warlock don't really appeal to me), and just messing with a druid solo or something.<br />
<br />
I personally doubt Blizzard will add rez to druids, but it would be interesting to see their reasoning on why.</div></div><hr />

Druids aren't that powerful. They are about the only class that has not, at one time or another, been considered over-powered by other players. Having rez wouldn't make druids unstoppable, all it would mean is that it might be a little easier for them to find groups, or to sub for a priest when none are around.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a LOT more powerful than druids in WoW. Some even say they are overpowered. Yet they have rez.<br />
<br />

Nobody is demanding anything. It's Beta and they are constantly asking for suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Look at Pali's they're brought along to tank, sure, but in the event that things go wrong, a Pali's job is to run so he can res, do you really want to be the one who's entire purpose is wipe insurance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am on my 4th druid now pasted 25, and I never have a problem getting into instance groups.  People love a druids for the damage and Priests love the backup healing.<br />
<br />
And dont start with the Shaman/Druid comparing...there is nothing to compare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I don't mind.  Between the fact that I know how to play a paladin well, and that paladins are very useful as &quot;Oh crap&quot; members...I get invite into many many instance groups.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with Druids getting rez is they then essentially remove any need for a paladin.<br />
<br />
I do see problems for druids, however.  While, at the moment, they are welcome on raids as an extra healer (and to ensure all the caster leather doesn't rot), once raids actually require the raid limit...people aren't going to be hugely keen on druids taking up slots they could have priests in (the same problem Paladins may well have).  How much of that is going to be perception over truth...I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kongg</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO being an extra healer in groups in &quot;handy&quot; and that's it.  I've never been considered the healer and in every situation so far I've been the &quot;damage dealer&quot; next to the tanking Warrior.  I like the fact that this is my role and in the case of an emergency I can step up and add an extra heal or two.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is: druids are healers.  And, AFAIK, the only healer class without rez.  Having rez doesn't prevent you from shifting into other forms, and you can still specialize in the shifting tree or something if you would rather tank/do DPS.<br />
<br />
I could see making it not as good as priest rez or something, but I don't see how it'd hurt to have rez, honestly.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion though. :)</div></div><hr />
