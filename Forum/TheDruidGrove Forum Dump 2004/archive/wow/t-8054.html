New Raid Encounters<br />
Rumors of Onyxia, an enormous black dragon, have been heard through<br />
out Azeroth. Be sure to bring many brave warriors for she won’t<br />
take kindly to intruders in her lair. Both factions will need to<br />
complete unique, and challenging quests to gain access to the<br />
Onyxia encounter. **During the beta testing there will be a<br />
temporary placeholder vendor who sells keys to Onyxia’s lair for<br />
testing purposes.<br />
<br />
Discovered in the heart of Blackrock Mountain beyond the Depths,<br />
lies the Molten Core. Within the Molten Core lives a multitude of<br />
ancient and powerful evil. Adventurers be ware, for the dangers found<br />
within the Molten Core are many and takes many forms.<br />
<br />
**Raid loot is being worked on and temporary loot has been placed in<br />
raid encounters<br />
<br />
<br />
New Kodo mounts!<br />
There is but one creature in all of Kalimdor that possesses the<br />
strength and stamina to bear a tauren rider into battle: the<br />
majestic kodo beast. Swifter and slightly smaller than their<br />
wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same<br />
resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits<br />
that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. It<br />
is said that only the most virtuous of tauren can win the affection<br />
of a kodo war mount, for these mighty beasts only serve those that<br />
approach them with honor and respect in<br />
their hearts.<br />
<br />
Tauren players will no longer have the Plainsrunning ability, due<br />
to the availability of Kodo mounts! Tauren players can purchase the<br />
Kodo mount at Bloodhoof village.<br />
<br />
**Currently there is an active bug that prevents players from<br />
purchasing mounts from different races regarding of reputation, this<br />
bug will be addressed in the next patch.<br />
<br />
<br />

accommodate the new penalty for dying)<br />

longer any experience loss, instead all items (equipped and<br />

awaiting release of driver bug fixes from Apple and GPU vendors. We will<br />
release a patch to re-enable shader based graphic effects in Mac WoW when<br />
that becomes feasible<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />

abilities as well (Blood Craze, Enrage).<br />

whole herd won't follow you.<br />
- If you close the disenchanting loot pane without looting the item, the<br />
Dust or Essence or Shard is automatically looted for you. (You no<br />
longer destroy the enchanted item if you close the loot pane with the<br />
results of the disenchantment)<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
- Vocal emotes now display a normal emote to the chat window, instead of<br />
the &quot;Player says...&quot; text. Voice Emote Audio is unchanged.<br />
- There is now a checkbox to turn off audio emotes.<br />
- Many boxes and crates ready to be looted have been added around the<br />
world.<br />

<br />
I was a druid NOT wanting to get res, I guess this is the halfway point, good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it seems like a decent compromise to me.  The spell also has higher ranks with more HP/mana returned, and different reagents.  I wonder how hard the seeds are to get...<br />
<br />
Feline Grace is a passive ability, cat form only, reduces falling damage.<br />
<br />
Reagent needed for higher ranks of Mark is Wild Berries, then Wild Root, then Wild Thornroot.<br />
<br />
Edit: Weird, there are quests giving out self ports, like &quot;Teleport: Moonglade&quot; now.  Moonglade is apparently neutral, I saw a tauren druid there too.</div></div><hr />

New spell teleport moonglade seems to be a druid only enclave with several quests.  The are based upon our shape shifting forms.  So far I've recieved quests about both the bear and the sea lion form.  I haven't yet recieved a quest regarding cat form even though I am level 22 and have the spell will have to see if it is a later part of same quest line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Teleport Moonglade is a spell you recieve from the druid trainer on 2nd level of the Darnasas druid tree.  It's a quest series, I'm not sure of the level of the first quest I'm thinking it would be about level 10 as it relates to bear form (all 3 quests given to me originally were grey).  I was directed to that trainer from the druid trainer on the lower level of the tree.</div></div><hr />

In a game like WoW where the death penalty is relatively mild, I don't believe that resurrection is such a big deal anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, level 10 Bearform skill is now a quested skill.  I think the level 15 Seal form and level 20 Cat form are as well.<br />
<br />
Hunters at level 10 get the ability to tame beasts - that's now a quest as well.<br />
<br />
I like this change, as it makes it feel more like an accomplishment when you have to go out and learn a new skill through a quest - and shapeshifting is a major skill, so I like having it quested.  Wouldn't want all skills/spells to be that way, but the major ones like this seem ok.<br />
<br />
Only problem is people are reporting that you can't really complete the quest for the Seal form unless you already have Seal form (or lots of underwater breathing potions) as it involves a search for a trinket on the bottom of a lake and it's really hard to see apparently.  Hopefully that can be tuned a bit though.</div></div><hr />

Rez is bassically required there, if you wipe you end up having to start at the entrance of the instance again and clear your way all the back through, which can take a long time.<br />
<br />
And this patch overall was horrible nerfing/changing of most classes, really bad all around, lots of pointless annoying changes. And still not really enough to get me to want to play a druid in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggen</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a lot &quot;emotionally invested&quot; in classes other than Druids, so their changes aren't something that I've particularly analyzed. I don't really perceive much for Druids at least that could be considered a horrible nerf. Quite the contrary, the addition of Rez and extra quest content pretty much made the class perfect in my eyes.<br />
<br />
It wasn't my intention for my last post be taken to mean that I feel Rez is trivial--in fact it's very convenient. However, it doesn't carry the same weight in WoW that it bears in EQ. Since the patch on Sunday lazy death in WoW does now seem to carry a bit of a sting as it taps the old pocketbook, but you can't delevel or lose abilities or stop advancing (can anyone say Group Experience Debt? Thanks Sony--NOT) because of it.<br />
<br />
Consequently, I don't view Rez in WoW as class-defining the way it is in EQ. That's all. No big deal to add to Druids.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, not sure I agree with that :) Some of the changes I am not sure about yet, reagants costs seem too much right now and they already changed it so you don't have a death penalty for a PvP death like I was hoping.  Those are my main concerns, the rest will probably need some minor tuning, but I don't think the changes were pointless.  Anyway, just my opinion!</div></div><hr />
