With so many EQ uber guilds going to WOW, the thought occurs to me that WOW will not just be a perpetuation of what we have in EQ.  I have not tested it, so I can only make guesses.  It may be the case that WOW will be resistant to the 80/20 rule.  If so, that's fine.  However, I am concerned that in trying to enjoy a new game, I'll instead be seeing Blizzard art painted over an EQ political landscape.</div></div><hr />

It's more likely EQ2 will have EQ's politics to a much greater degree than WoW<br />
<br />
And depending on how the tournaments/guilds/PVP work, the political structure of EQ may not work in WoW, especially if there's some sort of economical balance in WoW, as that's the major source of power in EQ<br />

<br />
I am sure they will take pains to avoid each other but we will see ; ).<br />
<br />
The other thing that will happen that people won't expect (but which I have seen from my Horizons experiences) is that people will come in from completely different games, also as whole guilds that were successful in those games.  ie, a strong UO guild, or a strong DAOC guild, or a strong clan from an online shooter (there will be a lot more of that in WOW due to the PVP).<br />
<br />
It will be an interesting time of turmoil, but those guilds that are getting into the game as a group in beta will have an edge.<br />
<br />
But ... the reason I don't play EQ anymore is that while I occasionally like to watch the fireworks from the distance, I really don't want any part of that competitive culture at this point.<br />
<br />
I will try WOW and if the game works for me from a pure game mechanics perspective, I wlil play it and see where it leads.  But my gut is that I will not like it enough to endure the culture I think it will spawn.</div></div><hr />

And because so many of the uber guilds are going to WoW I was concerned that they'll have the same sort of influence over its direction that they did over EQ. :(  <br />
<br />
Oh well.  If the game begins to stink for casual players like EQ, I'll stop playing.</div></div><hr />

Well, not the whole guild.  Just the over competitive players that will turn the game into another cesspool of politics.  I am glad I was never part of that, but I have seen the fallout from it.  Most people do not realize there is someone behind the avatar and do not care about hurt feelings.  All they care about is their own greed.  It is rather disenheartening to see a friend in tears because of something someone said.</div></div><hr />

Wherever there is more than one human, there will be drama and politics.  It doesnt matter what the venue may be.  But the design of wow should keep the traditional EQ-style of content racing/cockblocking to a minimum.  There will be other issues, of course, but to worry about EQ guilds causing the bulk of them is silly.  Even if nobody from EQ ever played WoW, politics and drama would still emerge.<br />
<br />
After all, for many people that's one of the big reasons to actually play a Massively Multiplayer game.  It's one of the things you cant get in a single player game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was not what happened in the game, but what the people said to her.  How they treated her and it was directly related to content racing and the typical attitude you get with the uber guild.</div></div><hr />

I do admit that I like them soemtimes. If WOW going to have it, that's great, if they don't. That's great either :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quinalla</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, there is drama and politics in any group of people, whether every &quot;uber guild&quot; from EQ plays WoW or not.  And drama/politics is not limited to uber guilds anyway, they just well known so what they do is seen by more people.  <br />
<br />
I am glad they have recruited some folks like that to help them in beta.  WoW has already taken great strides to make the game casual-friendly (solo ability for all, trying to make all classes desireable for groups, rest states, quests that help guide players to new areas, hearthstones, forgiving death penalty and more), they also want to make it powergamer-friendly as well and IMO this means having an &quot;endgame&quot;.  I want this game to have that, I am tired of MMOs that on release have nothing for you to do once you reach max level or have something that isn't balanced/fun, but maybe that is just me :)</div></div><hr />

As someone who gamed on battle.net for about a year before starting up EQ, I was absolutely shocked by how polite and mature most of the population of EQ was. People were speaking proper english, having intelligent conversations, even using proper fantasy names instead of kkthxl33tdud3 or 187syk0k1ll4. (god I hope WoW has a naming policy similar to EQ) At it's absolute worst, EQ has nothing on the Diablo II crowd. *cringe*</div></div><hr />

I have seen quite a few EQ folks bring this up, though I am glad you are at least speaking from experience.  I did notice some of the d00ds you are talking about when I played on battlenet, but there are plenty of nice people there too.  And Diablo/Diablo2 doesn't encourage you to play nice as much as MMOs do, it is just a complete different enviornment, as I am sure you know.<br />
<br />
The fact that there will be GMs in WoW that can (and hopefully will) enforce the rules will keep a lot of people in line.  Also, the community will hopefully discourage stupid behavior as well, as people paying a montly fee tend to expect better than a free service like bnet.  Also, not everyone in EQ is nice or speaks proper english, but generally it is better than bnet.  Regardless, I don't think bnet is the horror that some try to make it out to be :)<br />
<br />
As for the naming policy, I agree completely.  I am not too picky about names, but if someone can't come up with something better than your two examples, I would hope it would be changed by a GM or the filter will not allow it.</div></div><hr />

My battle.net experiences weren't all bad, but enough of them were that I certainly wouldn't have paid for it as a subscription service. One thing that I think contributed to the seemingly more mature community in EQ is the subscription fees, hopefully that will translate to WoW.<br />

Coming from EverQuest i'm pretty skeptical when someone suggests the GMs will keep people in line. On a typical day in EQ it will take as many as 6+ hours to get a response out of a GM even on catastrophic gameplay bugs. One incident involving a recent Rallos Zek kill for my guild where a stranger snuck in and ninja-looted one of the items took about a month to resolve. Perhaps Blizzard will be able to afford more GMs, even just at first to help with the game in it's infancy, but I won't hold my breath on that one.<br />
<br />
As for Battle.net, I wouldn't have played if it wasn't enjoyable. Between the mouthy kids, the goofy names, and the instability (*shudders as he recalls linkdeath issues*) it wasn't anywhere near as enjoyable an experience as it could have been. Also, with Diablo II there was some measure of control over who you'd interact with and a limit on how many players in game. No locking mouthy kids out of WoW cause you don't feel like dealing with them, you've got to get a GM involved. (which again takes time, and rarely ends up being effective)<br />

<br />
Unfortunately the screenshots show quite a few names I would hope won't make it past the naming policy, but I guess we'll have to wait on that. Don't really enjoy hanging around in a fantasy world populated by Drizzzt, Drizt, Drizzt23, Drizzt24, Dr1zzt and Drizztt. :P</div></div><hr />
