Ordinn will be vigilantly overseeing the forums with Tyren and Caydiem, helping everyone stay informed and up to date on the latest happenings in the game. With our community team fully staffed, we expect to be ramping up our forum coverage heavily now and reporting more community-related information in general. Ordinn, Tyren, and Caydiem are looking forward to continuing to get to know everyone better; thanks again for making them feel welcome! <br />
<br />
It's good to see Blizzard addressing their community team and expanding it at the same time they're bringing in more players, instead of well after the fact.  Best of luck to Ordinn and I hope the community treats him well.<br />
