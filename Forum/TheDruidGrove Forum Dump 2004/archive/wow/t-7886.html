I'm guessing no, but what do all you beta testers think about re-leveling?<br />
Do you mind?<br />
If not, why?<br />

<br />
But, if you are a beta tester (lucky bastage! :p) then you gain a lot of knowledge that'll help you get back up to speed quickly upon release :)</div></div><hr />

The only game i've seen give some sort of advantage to beta testers was City of Zeroes allowing players to register a name on the servers so no one else could take it, which didn't work anyway since they messed up the DB's during the 3 day head start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lineage 2 let beta accounts carry over, but only after wiping every char, and then opening the beta to everyone who wanted to play (an open beta). So, pretty much, it was just a free month to play for everyone, then you had to buy the game, if you did that you got another free month.<br />
<br />
So there was no real advantage in Lineage 2's method, which is good. Good marketting too, but Lineage 2 was small compared to EQ2. You could easily download it. Don't think EQ2 will be easily downloadable. Heh.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming they would whip before release, also it would not be fair to the lower level to be thrown into a world full of high level chars, espically on the PVP servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best a beta tester could hope for in that regard is that they would keep a beta server open on release as a &quot;Test&quot; server and leave the characters there for testing purposes.  But I highly doubt it would happen.<br />
<br />
Beta testers already get an &quot;edge&quot; just from their enhanced knowledge of the game, there really is no need for anything else.  And yes, I *am* actually looking forward to starting over in Release.  :)   I am trying to purposely avoid playing any races/classes very much that I will mainly play in release to intentionally not spoil myself.  But I would even consider playing another warrior up, because thats how much fun its been.  :)</div></div><hr />
