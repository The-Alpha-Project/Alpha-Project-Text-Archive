I gotta admit, I played a druid during Stress Test and they are good, very versitile. I could be a tank, rogue or a healer (kinda). The forms really gave the druid real power to the itself and made it like a bard within groups (capable of filling in the gaps).<br />
<br />
Think there will be too many druids in game? I think they are a bit &quot;over&quot; powered, to be honest. You can create a full group of druids and still have your Tanks, Healer, crowd control, and attacker.</div></div><hr />

Above warlocks, but not much else.  It's hard to say, though, really, because they're still balancing the classes and adding talents.<br />
<br />
My guess is that there will be a ton of druids at release, but that will taper off as people swap to the higher dps, lower responsibility (that is to say, not as much responsibility for keeping the group alive) classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">During Stress Test there was hords of Night Elves. It seemed like 40% where druids, 30% were hunters and the remainder were mixed in the other classes that they could be. I know Stress Testing was to test the loads, but it was a good indecator of the number of druids.<br />
<br />
I guess one of the other reasons there might not be as many druids is due to the limitations of races. Only two races, one on each side, Horde and Alliance. That would cut down the number of druids really, some people refuse to be cows and want to play Horde and vis. versa for NEs.</div></div><hr />

Finally got my own account so I am rolling a Priest yet will return to my Druid when talents become available.  Druids are definitely the most versatile and probably one of the most enjoyable classes when played right, however, I think a lot of people will always want a Priest as their MHealer... always.  (This is especially true in BRD)</div></div><hr />

My highest char is 10, so don't really know much about the higher level stuff. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mostly for rez, though i've found a good warlock and a druid make an excellent pair for keeping a party healthy with the ability to rez (through soulstones)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the problem is that Blizzard is has finally started creating difficult encounters for the high end game.<br />

Black Rock Depths (which is just the tip of the iceberg, evidently), in its current encarnation virtually requires the holy trinity: Warrior, Priest, Mage.  This leaves you with two spots.  IMO, its better to bring a paladin as a back-up healer than a druid, since the paladin is better DPS and can absorb more damage if need be (such as when its time to run like Brave Sir Robin so you can come back and rez the group...which a Druid can't do).<br />
<br />
I've begun to doubt if any designer can create a game where specialist classes won't be much more desired than &quot;hybrid&quot; classes.  Even worse...the way BRD is now, you not only need specialist classes, they have to have their talent points specced correctly as well (warrior better be defensive spec, and mage much be instant AE spec, and heaven help the idiot priest who is shadow spec).</div></div><hr />

Been to BRD as the MH with a Paladin in group (whom we fed our soulstones to), but just seems better when you have a Priest along.  Some encounters such as Ghost Ring req. dps vs. endurance (ie. Emp/Princess).<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out the new patch note.. lots of wine has significantly reduced my ability to think thoroughly. lol  Gosh, won't they let me on now that I can play again!!!</div></div><hr />
