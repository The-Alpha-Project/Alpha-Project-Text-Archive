<br />
I looked in game and 1280x960 was an option to choose so I tried to do that.  of course I now can only get a black screen with a box that says &quot;video mode not supported&quot;  and restarting it does nothing.  <br />
<br />
Can someone please tell me how to get the video resolution back to what it's supposed to be.  And I promise to leave this machine alone other than to turn it on.  Sigh :(  Sorry to be a bother, any help will be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You do know that with the patch, there's DX9c only calls within the graphics engine. Blizzard has suggested to use it for a while, and just recently (shortly before last patch--about the time of Stress Test) made it a requirement.<br />
<br />
I think that's your problem, if I'm reading that right; you don't have DX9c installed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds to me like you need a format and reinstall of your O/S.   Back when I was still running 95 or 98 I had to typically do that every 3 months or so to maintain a well running system.   For what its worth, I have yet to have to do that on XP since its come out.<br />
<br />
To clarify a bit:  Changing your resolution in WoW should not have made your windows stop performing normally, and if it did, it was not your fault, your windows is just damaged.</div></div><hr />

You have no idea how black and blue I am right now from kicking myself over trying to change that setting.  It was just something someone posted on the WoW boards that he said fixed the same graphical problem I'm having.  I saw that the resolution he said he changed to was one of the resolutions it allowed you to choose in the game and clicked on it and hit ok....evidently it's not ok.  Anyway I have turned it off and giving it a wide berth right now.  If I get brave enough I'll try to see if I can do the fix Yrys was kind enough to post, if not I'll visit my friendly computer shop and take the whole mess along with the info that was posted here and pray someone can fix what I broke.  Thanks again guys, I appreciate there being helping hands here :).</div></div><hr />

Deleting the WTF and WDB folder should straighten out WoW for you, but if you can't get windows to start properly then it's a different matter entirely.  Too bad you couldn't bring it by the company i work for, we could probably get you up and running without charging an arm and a leg.</div></div><hr />

If I can go in in safe mode and delete those then will they just be repatched the next time I try to enter WoW?<br />
<br />
It's the WTF/config.wtf file and the WDB folder?  I should delete both?<br />
<br />
Darn EQ for getting rid of Winged Courier, I'd just pop this comp from Houston over to ya Crimson :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes you should delete both, and WoW will generate defaults for both if they're not there.  Also, i'm pretty sure it won't fix your windows problems, but it's worth a try... also check what resolution windows is set for when you reboot in safe mode, maybe that got changed somehow.<br />
<br />
As for using a winged courier to get it here... sorry :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as it turns out my monitor couldn't handle that setting.  After putting my machine on our older monitor we were able to reset the resolution finally.  So now I have more to look at in normal mode than a screen with Video Mode Not Supported.<br />
<br />
I still have the problem with the black ground textures since I can't load DirectX 9.0c,  but at least I can use the machine and play the game.  Thanks for all the help :).</div></div><hr />
