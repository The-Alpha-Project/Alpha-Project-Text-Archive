<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been an issue argued about and complained about since the Beta boards were first up and from what I understand even back into the Alpha.  WoW puts everything into the power of right-clicking, from sitting, to opening boxes, to talking to NPC's and to buying and selling.  With most actions taking a single right click to complete, when it comes to buying and selling, accidents do happen.<br />
<br />
Though it can be traumatic to accidently buy a piece of equipment you can't use or that's inferior to what you have for a fair chunk of change and having to sell it back at about half it's worth, that's not the real issue.  The real issue is how easy it is to accidently right click something important and invaluable in your inventory (such as King of Dragon's Dragon Whelpling) and accidently sell it... with no way of ever getting it back from that vendor, now THAT's a crisis.<br />
<br />
Well, with the issue in hand, it looks like the design and programming team are coming to the rescue:<br />
<br />
King of Dragons, I am very sorry that you accidentally sold your Crimson Whelpling to the vendor. I know how terribly sad and angry that must make you. <br />
<br />
The team is very much aware of this problem and has already started working on a solution. Once implemented, the new Vendor System will allow players to sell and then buy back items sold to the vendor at the same price. A time limit will be set for the buy back to eliminate vendors being used as additional storage. <br />
<br />
This is a fairly complex system; therefore I have no ETA on when it will be added to the game. <br />

&gt;^..^&lt; <br />

<br />
Though I've never accidently sold anything myself (not that I have anything that valuable as of yet), I can see this system as a God-send as I'm sure I'll get around to selling something I don't intend to at some point ;)<br />
<br />
Let's just hope it's after the new system is in.</div></div><hr />

BAD UI design from the get-go here, it's an obvious problem, even EQ long ago fixed these types of things. Suprising the things they haven't learned from the other games.</div></div><hr />
