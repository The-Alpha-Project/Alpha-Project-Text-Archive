IF they lowered xp requirements like they said. My night elf rogue was out of yellow quest (and orange) so I had to move to human lands to level up. Darkshore is the suck.</div></div><hr />

I had the same problem with my night elf, I had to head over to loch modan and do a few dwarf quests before coming back to Darkshore/Ashenvale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the xp requirements are most definately lowered, if you had enough xp to put you into the next level ogre has set it so you're the xp for the next level -1 so you're first xp will level you.<br />

There's a big ruckus about rogue's getting stealth nerfed... this is false.<br />
<br />
The only intentional changes to rogues (beyond the cosmetic renaming of a few things and some new animations for dual weild) are all mentioned in the patch notes and the only real thing that can be seen as an intentional nerf is the inability for rogues to use bucklers any more, forcing us to be less of a tank and more roguish.<br />
<br />
There is however a pretty massive bug effecting rogues that dual weild (pretty much all of them now since we can't use bucklers) that kills off accuracy, regular attacks seem to miss about 50% of the time and our special abilities are a bit more likely to miss at 60% (based on some parsed data from the forums).<br />
<br />
Though it can get pretty frustrating fighting a Black Dragon Whelp (i'm only level 16) and missing on your kick attack (interrupt's casting) more often than you land it, i'm refusing to whine about it and stop playing my rogue in some sort if immature childish protest.</div></div><hr />

(Undead, named Caldrach if anyone else is playing horde)  It is really really cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My druid is 22 now and I like to fight as a kitty, I don't miss NEARLY as much as kitty as I do as my rogue. My DPS as kitty is FAR superior as my rogue. My rogue has it easier vs casting mobs of course, but kitty just tears stuff up.</div></div><hr />
