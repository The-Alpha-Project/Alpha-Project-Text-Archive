Is there an underwater dungeon or locale?  I know I'm in the minority, but I  loved the underwater dungeons in EQ, it would be cool to have one in WOW.</div></div><hr />

Most fights are above land however getting around the dungeon involves some swimming and at least one of the quests is underwater.  <br />
<br />
There are also several quests that involve sunken ships along the coasts. I personally don't like those much since mobs tend to be able to zip through walls and be out of line of sight until they bring back friends and the fact that ships are considered to be inside locations and therefore druids can't root while in or on them.</div></div><hr />

Judging from the map, they are the size of a small (deadwind pass) to medium size zone. The largest one is almost as big as Tedrassil!<br />
<br />
The ocean that separets Kalimdor and Azeroth may contain sunken ruins... The old Kalimdor continent spans from the present Kalimdor to Azeroth. History has it that the old Well of Eternity is in the middle of the old Kalimdor continent. It is reasonable to assume that there may be great cities and towns beside the old Well of Eternity. These cities and towns are of cause now underwater...<br />
<br />
Would B_Delacroix like to take the swim across the ocean? I would love to do it but I am not living in the Blizzard designated areas for the North American retail WoW.<br />
<br />
I reckon that with the aqua form, it would take about 10 minutes real time to swim from the west coast of westfall to reach the nearest island. From there, to the largest island would however take at least 30 minutes - achievable if you are planning to take a long bubble bath, just place a paper weight on the arrow key.<br />
<br />
Once you arrive at the biggest island, you can either explore it or head straight to its north coast. Its north coast is very near to the old Well of Eternity (which is now a wirlpool). You will know what to do from there...<br />
<br />
Some coastal zones, despite having a coast, are bordered by mountains. Dun Morogh is an example. What do you think lies on the shores of such little travelled places?<br />
<br />
I had jumped off the Loch Modan's dam towards the wetland side and is now itching to do the above than anything!<br />

Unfortunatly you can not swim across the ocean.  Deep water will kill you due to fatigue in less than 10 minutes.  You will even die to fatigue as a ghost if you attempt to cross it that way.  The only way to cross the ocean is via ship.</div></div><hr />

I read a post on the WoW beta boards that someone actually did it in early beta.  Took a long time, but he found a &quot;gulf&quot; out in the middle of the ocean that you could fall into and die.  Like a blank space between the two continents or something.  Shortly after he did that, they changed it so you couldn't swim across any more.<br />
<br />
Don't know if that's true or not, but it's what I read.</div></div><hr />

What a pity... He didn't even reach any of the 4 islands that I mentioned? On the map, the nearest island to westfall doesn't look very far... Its just an average zone distance away from Westfall. I think as aqua form, the swimming time should be at most 10 mins from westfall to the nearest island.<br />
<br />
I didn't know there is fatique bar in swimming other than my fingers actually getting fatique from pressing the forward button. <br />
<br />
Will some druids really take a 10 mins to try the westfall to island trip? I think by now there should be some level 20s druids around.<br />

There is an auto-run button. :D<br />
<br />
I don't mind the fact they put in that fatigue. The first time I saw it I was wondering why it was there. After checking around where i was, doing some testing, I realized it only happened when I went into the deep ocean parts. No big deal, so you can't swim far out. I think it's a good thing really. Stops the swiming endlessly to part of the game which aren't built/done just cause of it's design. The game isn't designed for people to go out into the middle of nowhere, no would it make any sense (in game or RL).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I stop the fatigue by healing, eating or drinking?<br />
<br />
I am still eager to reach one of those islands...<br />
<br />
I am a noobs... how do I auto-run?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Do you fatigue if you are in aqua form?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

And autorun is numlock, by default.</div></div><hr />

The best one was the amulet piece in Westfall at the shipwreck.  Visibility in the water isn't crystal clear but it isn't limited to nose length either.  The only things missing are beds of seaweed swaying in the tide.</div></div><hr />
