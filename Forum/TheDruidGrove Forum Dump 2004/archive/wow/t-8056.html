<br />
Last night I was playing my hunter a bit (since talents finally went in).  I didn't have enough money for all my level 16 spells/skills as it is, so I went out to work on a quest that involved killing some Blackwood Gnarlpines (decent money usually).  I ended up dying 4 times over the course of an hour (twice to lag and twice to bad luck).  Finally finished the quest and headed back in to town to sell and hopefully get my last skill I needed for level 16.  I sold all the loot for ~ 8 silver and then repaired all my gear (degraded from the 4 deaths) for ~ 6 silver... meaning I was still short of having enough for my 18 silver skill I needed :(<br />
<br />
Plus, I looted a nice dagger during the quest, but its durability was fully degraded when I looted it, so I not only had to repair all my own gear, but I had to repair the new dagger I just got too :( (I'm hoping that was a bug, and not an intentional change)<br />
<br />
10% degrade per death isn't that bad, but I think it's still degrading through use and heaven forbid you die without a rez as you'll get the 100% durability penalty... lots of unhappy people died in one of the new instances last night and had to pay 5-6 gold to repair their gear.  Not good.<br />
<br />
Combine that with the new regents on a lot of spells and there are a lot of angry players suddenly.<br />
<br />
This brings back bad memories for me.  Horizons made major game-balance changes in the last week prior to release (including a total revamp of the Dragon class) and had nothing but problems for a couple of months after release as they tried to play catch up.   Look where Horizons is today :(<br />
<br />
Now WoW has made several huge game balancing changes in the last 2 weeks prior to release... hope it works out better for them than it did for Horizons.</div></div><hr />

Upping the repair cost 5x+, and all these pointless stupid reagents they added, along with a lot of ****ty class changes, are not though. And yes, gear degrades though use, though slower than it used to.</div></div><hr />

These are some pretty major changes to be adding just before launch.  I hope to hear more after you've had a chance to play for a little while.  I remember from the stress test not having much money left over after training, and was wondering how hard these changes really are hitting.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind the whole all armor goes to 0 durability. The problem I have is so does *everything* in your inventory. Two problems with this;<br />
<br />
1 - There is no bloody &quot;repaire all&quot; that will work on inventory items.<br />
2 - Costs can get very expensive if you have a number of stuff. I've herd somebody paying 10g to repair everything he had. That's FAR too much.<br />
<br />
Kill the part where you loose durability on all Inventory items and I'd be okay with it, on paper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've only died once or twice since the patch and i never use the spirit healer unless i have no other choice, so i haven't seen that myself.</div></div><hr />

That's odd. It stated in the Patch message &quot;all items (equiped and inventory)&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Average night of killing stuff will cost me 10g.  Hitting up raid content is insanely expensive, between death penalty and reagant costs.<br />
<br />
Its kind of ridiculous.  A guild can spent a couple hundred gold on a single night of raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is because the Molten Core is an instance inside an instance.<br />
<br />
You have to run through BRD to get to the Core...so when your ghost hits the BRD instance, it just ports you to the Core...and with the changes to warlock summons (you can no longer summon someone outside an instance into an instance, nor can you summon ghosts anymore), its bad chit if you want to raid the Core.<br />
<br />
I honestly wonder what happened to their testing on this aspect...how did they miss this one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned before, 10% every time you die.<br />
<br />
Figuring out new raid content = lots of deaths.<br />
<br />
My guild did a mass repair mid-way through the night...and then everyone had to repair again afterwards.<br />
<br />
The first time I repaired cost around 5g.  The second cost around 8.<br />
<br />
the other plate classes were about the same, with lesser costs to the other armor classes.<br />
<br />
Tack on the insane cost of reagants, and you're talking about alot of expense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hopefully they do tweak the repair costs in light of these changes and also alter the reagent cost a bit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that sounds very harsh.  I never got to the higher levels of course so I have no real feel for how much 13g is for a level 60 player.  I just know that at the levels I played I had very little left over cash and would have liked to have used it for some crafting, upgrading etc.  <br />
<br />
If they didn't have this plan in mind the entire time, I do hope they will adjust the mob and cash drops to allow players to still enjoy exploring and playing.  In EQ as a druid I always buffed people on the fly and I did the same with my druid buff in WoW, it will take away a lot if I can no longer do that due to the costs of a friendly buff :(.  I know that you can still use the highest free one, and I'll have to resort to that I guess for drive bys but still, I'm not happy to see this change. <br />
<br />
Having everything in your inventory degrade upon death also seems excessive.  I know they were trying to stop people from bagging items to save the repair costs, but if you can't change armor during battle anyway then what is the reasoning behind that?  If they just changed it to being the soulbound items that needed repairs then maybe that would be more reasonable?  I know that usually the things we would choose to equip were all soulbound anyway.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your ingame experiences, I appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I'm sorry, my mistake in reading your post. I thought you ment the spirit hearler rez and having to repair *everything* (equipped and inventory) when using her res.<br />
<br />
I do agree that 10% is a bit harsh as often as people die. I never died so often, so I'll ask you this; is it like EQII where armor becomes uneqipable at 30%? Or does it become unequipable at 0?<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out the implications of it actually running out verses constant repairs.<br />
<br />
And do repair costs vary based on the durability damange or is it same for all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It remains equipable always, however at 0%, it not longer provides any benefit.<br />
<br />
And cost is dependant on how much durability you've lost.  The various armor classes have a decending amount of durability.  Plate&gt;Mail&gt;Leather&gt;Cloth.  So plate can take more of a beating...but is more expensive to repair because it has more durability to repair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Players will only receive a 25% durability loss instead of 100% when using a Spirit Healer to resurrect <br />
<br />
- Players will now only incur a maximum 10 minutes of resurrection sickness instead of 30 minutes when using a Spirit Healer to resurrect <br />

- Some key buff spells will have their reagent requirements removed <br />

- Changes to Warriors Defensive Stance that will improve their ability to hold aggro</div></div><hr />

From my leveling since the change at lower levels, I really had no problems with the current system.  I even got stuck in a death loop of sorts with my shaman and died like 6 times before I managed to drag myself out of a bad spot and it still didn't seem to be much of a problem.  <br />
<br />
What *does* seem to be more of a problem is how this affects raids and I really don't see them addressing that.</div></div><hr />

They failed to mention the spirit healer also depleting inventory items. What's the word on that one?<br />
<br />
I know a GM stated it was a bug, but I'd also like to see this on the 'upcoming' changes post.</div></div><hr />

25% is a lot better than 100%, so they are on the right track I think.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's what I'm worried about too.<br />
<br />
100%, fine. But don't mess with the inventory items. That's my biggest grip. There is no simple way to repair your inventory items!</div></div><hr />
