My understanding is, currently, virtually all of your talent points must be focused into healing.<br />
<br />
It is unfortunate, but the current trend in WoW is for traditional class roles.  I won't go into high level content with a non defensive specced tank, or with a shadow magic specced cleric.<br />
<br />
A druid, if he's the backup healer, has more leeway for how he specs, but as a primary healer must be healing specced.</div></div><hr />

It was like this for me pre-patch but is even sicker post-patch.  Anyone have a chance to see what Spire of Hakkar and Azsharite Felbane Staves are now? :P</div></div><hr />

Well I was planning to be mostly grouping, taking advantage of what I understood to be a very versatile class for adapting different roles in a group, often switching between them to adapt to the flow of a particular battle.<br />
<br />
If this is no longer the case with the class...if everyone is being herded into the same template, I'm not sure I feel all that enthusiastic about buying WoW anymore, since it's starting to sound like all other MMPORPGs now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know that I necessarily agree with that Aidon.  It seems like with the changes and talents, a shifting specc'd druid could be just as good in a group as a warrior is currently.  (Of course, this might just be because warriors were over adjusted downward)<br />
<br />
So yes, you couldn't have a non healing specc'd druid as your primary healer in a high level instance necessarily, but maybe he could be your tank instead.   <br />
<br />
Just thinking out loud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nightshade</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the whole point is that I'd like to spec towards bringing out the Druid's primary function, which is supposedly the ability to fill gaps in a party (main tank, healer or DD in a non-high-level instance), and to respond to an emergency situation (switch to caster form for emergency healing, or bear form to tank an add or two, even in a high-level instance).<br />
<br />
I can see that it's possible to spec to make yourself a decent tank, decent healer, or decent DD'er, but if I wanted one of those three, I'd make the class that does one of those roles.  Instead, is it possible to spec toward the versatility that gives Druids their uniqueness?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, if you have 10 character slots filled, do NOT delete any of them... I deleted the 4th entry on my list and lost the first entry while the 4th remained... Bye bye level 45 rogue.</div></div><hr />
