   <br />
  As most know from other MMO's, Content keeps people interested.. new toys.. new spells.. new levels.. more damage.. more challenges are all part of each MMO's future.. <br />
   <br />
  But let me remind everyone.. that this is BETA.. and so far I have enjoyed my beta experience. Sure we are looking towards PvP, Raid type challenges, and more of what we have already seen.. But quite frankly, I rather not rush Blizzard into an early release of a push/patch. <br />
   <br />
  Tigole explained Blizzards position on the next beta and I have to agree with him on this.<br />
   <br />
   The patch is not out yet because we do not want to push until we can provide enough content that allows us to raise the level cap.   <br />
      <br />
   In addition to a number of zones that we are working on (Hinterlands, Tanaris, Feralas to name a few), we're also trying to include two new dungeons (Gnomeregan and Uldaman, possibly more) as well as some pretty major game systems.   <br />
      <br />
   In the future we hope to patch on a more frequent basis.      <br />
    As for things to do.. while waiting:<br />
      <br />
    - Try another Class!<br />
    - Try another Race!<br />
    - Build up your Trade Skills!<br />
      <br />
    And most importantly - Just have FUN!</div></div><hr />
