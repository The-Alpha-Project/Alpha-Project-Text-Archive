But even though I played on the stress test with no issues, after downloading the patches and entering game this time the ground was black.  I asked if everyone was seeing this and they said no to go download DirectX 9.0c.  <br />
<br />
I thought I had done this before but evidently I have not.  The problem is that when I try to download it I get a message that states &quot;A cabinet file necessary for installation cannot be trusted.&quot; And the download fails.  I went into my security settings and set them to low with the same results.  So I need some help from someone computer savvy if you have a minute and can tell me what I need to do to correct this problem.  Thanks in advance :).</div></div><hr />

Tried to get back into the game and the ground is still very black everywhere where there is shade under trees etc.  There are green shoots of grasses and flowers that do show up fine, and mobs as well, but especially in the Nightelf area where there's lots of trees and shade the ground is almost all black :(.  Not having any problems with movement, just this.<br />
<br />
So I ran a dxdiag and it says I have DirectX 9.0(4.09.0000.0900).  I'm doing something wrong here :).  The odd thing is what ever was on the machine before ran the stress test just fine.  Anyway thank you for the help.</div></div><hr />

You might try Blizzard's WoW knowledgebase (http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/) or e-mail wowtech@blizzard.com.<br />
<br />
Edit: Maybe DirectX isn't installed correctly or something.  For 9.0c, the version number is 4.09.0000.0904.</div></div><hr />

It must not be installing correctly :(.  Where did you install yours?  I mean when it ask me where to install it perhaps I didn't put it where I should?  <br />
<br />
Upon checking the boards, several people describe this same problem, some say that the 9.0c version clears it right up, one guy said it was the same, but I'm betting if I could get it installed correctly that would take care of it.  I really do appreciate your help.  These machines can make you feel so helpless when you don't know much more than how to turn them on :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it give any errors during the install?  And did you reboot afterward?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I still use Windows 98.  After getting that odd message about the cabinet file that cant be trusted again, I went to Download.com to see if maybe a mirror would be any different.  After reading so many people saying on that board that their comps crashed when they installed Direct X 9.0c if they weren't using XP, I've decided to just deal with the ground where there is supposed to be shade having no textures and being totally black.  I don't know enough about it to fix the comp if there was a problem.  I'll just cross fingers that whatever they put in with this last patch will be fixed again later, I had no problems at all in the stress test.  Thanks to you guys and to Tiane too for all the help :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it specifying what cab file it is?  If so you can use the windows file recovery to pull that cab file off the windows cd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, doesn't say which cannot be trusted.  It won't be long before I'll need to totally upgrade this comp anyway.  Maybe even before the game goes live, but because I also have to work on it and can't have it down, I'll probably just wait until I have pro on the machine.  I did lower the security settings and made sure they were on the trusted list just in case that had something to do with it, but produced the same results.</div></div><hr />
