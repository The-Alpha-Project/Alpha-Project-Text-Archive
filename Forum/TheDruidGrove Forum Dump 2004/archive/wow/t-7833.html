Just a friendly wonder on what the weather effects will be like, as i havent seen any thus far. Or maybe their out yet and i just havent caught them? <br />

To which Kat responded:<br />

Weather effects have not been added into the game yet, however; they are still planned. Once implemented, expect to see rain and snow at the very least. Due to the fact that weather is more of a visual item than anything else, it has a low priority and will be implemented closer to the end of the Beta Test. <br />
