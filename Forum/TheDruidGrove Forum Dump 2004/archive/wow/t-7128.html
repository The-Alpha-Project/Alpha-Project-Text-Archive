<br />
One thing I think would have been nice in EQ would have been if they had designated servers as &quot;time zone preferred&quot;.  For instance, a PST time zone preferred system you could log into knowing that most guilds and players would be on a PST play time schedule.   It was always rough for me, a PST player, to play in a mostly EST guild or with friends that were EST.  <br />
<br />
Also, how does time operate in Wow?  I remember reading they were thinking about using a 24 hour based clock.  I kind of didn't like that idea because I'd probably always be playing in the dark. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see a staggered 12 hour clock so for ever two WoW days one Earth day passes.  I've toyed with the idea of a 24 hour clock in a NWN module that offers different quests, responses, and the like based on the time they're playing.  Unfortunately you can't sync a NWN single player module with real world time.<br />
<br />
Back to the staggered 12 hour clock... they could also flip flop on patch days the timing... just to offer some variation to what players experience.</div></div><hr />

That way you can have some variety but not completely random... changing on patch days would kinda stink =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's true Scenera.  I would probably go to 14 hour days though.  I'd have to sit down and do the math though to figure out the best option though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggen</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would prefer to see a little more variety a little more frequently. I like the idea of 3 hour days--that makes for a very neat and predictable yet dynamic 8 WoW days per real day. 10 or 12 WoW days per real day would also work well I think. This makes sense to me since many people's playtimes are structured around 2-4 hour blocks.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm not sure that it would be sensible for Blizzard to designate particular servers for particular timezones, as processing load would be an issue. At peak servers would be staggering, while offtimes would see a great deal of processing power go to waste. By making each server timezone independent they can spread out the burden more evenly. Players inevitably will organize themselves anyway, and the &quot;time zone advantage&quot; goes away in instanced dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TauTropfen</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the, admitted, good idea of &quot;time zone based servers&quot; is that people exploit that. Take EQ as an example and take the number of us guilds being on a &quot;euro&quot; server. With serverdown you get the respawns and the ability to raid after the patch but before the europeans get up. Seen it happening and will see it happening. Sad thing is people always will do their best to exploit every &quot;player friendly&quot; idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But there's also a penalty for being on the wrong time zone and that is that you won't find many group mates.<br />
<br />
In EQ, of of the problems we had in the West was that the East generally got to cherry pick the mobs that were up.  They'd be sitting up all day while everyone is at work/school, then the first folks home and online would get the goods.  <br />
<br />
Now perhaps that won't happen in WoW with all the instancing they intend to use.<br />
<br />
But the other advantage of being in the &quot;correct timezone&quot; is that you'll find more people to play with regularly.  Quite often I'd only get to see my buddies for an hour or two and they'd be logging off for the night.  <br />
<br />
...<br />
...<br />
Then again, now that I think of it, I don't want to be playing any game as much as I played EQ.  So perhaps this really isn't a problem. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen several posts in the beta forums extolling the greatness of the 24 hour time clock, but still have yet to see a REASON its so great. Except the usual suspects &quot;immersion&quot; and &quot;realism&quot;.</div></div><hr />

AH!  That is better.  I actually kind of like that idea.  You could go chase the sunrise or something. :p</div></div><hr />

Kat just recently announced that they are no longer planning on doing this.  Still Beta though, who knows how things will end up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quinalla</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it would be great for them to have some time-zone preferred servers, especially nice for people who don't know anyone going into the game and people who can only play for short periods of time.  I don't think guilds hogging spawns is going to be an issue in WoW, but we will have to see once the end-game-type stuff gets in.<br />
<br />
As for the 24-hour game time, I think it is a pretty cool idea, though I can see the value in having it be a little shorter so you could see different times of day even if you only play at one time.  A nice long day/night cycle is definitely cool IMO, much better than a day that lasts an hour real-time or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yaladdar</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people gave exemples of things like right now in the beta, there is an village of humans in the undead zones but they turn into werewolves at night.<br />
<br />
I hope there is not quests linked to things like that (ex: kill werewolves chief, ...), will be hard for some persons not able to play at the right times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok ok, probably more than just one of USEast/West but i'd be surprised if they didn't split the US 50/50 with a PST and EST preferred server. (leaving those of us on CST to choose *smirk*, likely USWest this time around since i'm working evenings)</div></div><hr />
