<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylo</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever since I have read the class discription of the Druid and all of its disclosed abilities, I KNEW I had to be a Tauren Druid. I am a big fan of support classes that are very dynamic. Need a tank? Poof. Need a healer? Poof. Need a scout? Poof. Need a damage dealer? Poof. Need help underwater? Poof. Need me there ASAP? Poof. <br />
<br />
In case if you haven't been reading up on the class, the Druid is primarily a healer and shapeshifter, with some good crowd control and damge spells. In Tauren/NE form, he or she is second in healing only to the Priest. This is the form in which he or she will cast spells, simple enough. then there is the bear form (warrior), panther (rogue), bird (speedy), underwater form(unique), and ambient form (scout). <br />
<br />
I was talking with Vae Victus today though and he asked a very good question: &quot;Why would you want to be something that will never be as good as its related class?&quot; <br />
<br />
I realize it's too early to judge the entire class, but I want some of your opinions on the jack of all trades as we do know the class' primary nature. <br />
<br />
Personally, the dynamic nature of the class seems so exciting. Perfect soloer, perfect grouper in my opinion. I'll never be held to one role. I'm also positive that the forms won't be weaker exact renditions of the other classes, I know there will be unique abilities that will shine. <br />
<br />
Yes I'm bored, thanks for letting me waste your time. So... you think I'm gonna be useless as a Druid and that I should pick a class that is king of one area, or have I hope that the Druid might prove to be extremely useful/versatile?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind WoW Druids are not to be compared to those of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the versatility will be both the thing people love about being a druid but it'll also be the thing they dislike about it.  I suspect druids will pay by being 2nd or 3rd best at everything, just like they did in EQ.  <br />
<br />
Still, I enjoyed my druid immensely and it is tempting to consider rolling one in WoW... but, I feel pretty invested in being a rogue now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite thing in these games is &quot;toys&quot;.   IE, fun/unique things to do.   In EQ, I accomplished this by being a druid(IE, large set of abilities/spells, even if they weren't the best) and also by being an enchanter(illusions of course).  So, similarly, I will probably be drawn in by the shapeshifting aspects of the Druid in WoW.   There is just something to be said for having a lot of different roles.  Far less potential for boredom.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggen</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few classes in EQ that historically have tended to see a lot more of the game as a whole than others, one of which is the Druid. I know for a fact that had I picked almost any other class back in 1999, I wouldn't have seen nearly as much of Everquest as I have with Riggen. With him I've been to almost every nook and cranny of every zone outside of Time, seen every sight, and fought every encounter. Some places solo, some grouped, some in raids. Many over time in all three. I've gotten a lot of mileage out of the game thanks to my class.<br />
<br />
The shapeshifting aspect of Druids has attracted me since the days of AD&amp;D, and I think it can be a distinctive vehicle for bringing out that can-do go-anywhere ability in WoW Druids. I'm glad to see Blizzard emphasizing this aspect of their gameplay. I'm hopeful that they've examined the class dynamics of EQ and have taken note of what to avoid and what to embrace.<br />
<br />
The trick I think to keeping from falling into the &quot;underpowered&quot; trap while avoiding stepping on the toes of more focused classes is to deliberately create some unique synergies among the basic abilities of Druids. Based on comments from the interview that Sobe conducted with Blizzard it sounds a lot like this is the route that they're going to travel.<br />
<br />
Here's hopin'.</div></div><hr />

This versatility will be the downfall of the class.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the druid in any of these roles cannot be as good at them as the real deal. So, you must add the word &quot;gimped&quot; in front of each of those descriptions you mention.<br />
<br />
So, what will a &quot;good&quot; group do when they lose their healer? &quot;Group looking for priest.&quot; or perhaps they lost their rogue? &quot;Group looking for rogue&quot;. Lost your main tank? &quot;Group looking for warrior/paladin&quot;<br />
<br />
See the problem? Groups want to maximize their potential xp &quot;PEXP&quot; ;), and this equation will not include the word &quot;gimp&quot; in any of their choices. So unless you have good friends who are willing to accept a gimp in place of the real deal, and suffer loss of PEXP, then you will be stuck soloing... sound familiar? Its EQ. All over again.</div></div><hr />

MoW will also make druids a staple of some groups, a druid in bear form with MoW on him as well as the ability to put it on the rest of the group will certainly be a handy addition to any group.<br />
<br />
Whether they're &quot;gimped&quot; or not, i still intend to play one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylo</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feld, I think you're thinking that the druid forms are going to be exact but weaker copies of the other classes.  You MUST think of the unique abilities that have yet to be disclosed.  Crimson brings up a good point.<br />
<br />
I'm not sayin you're wrong or I'm right, I just think you're too quick to recall the horrors (heh) of EQ, which Blizzard clearly said they are avoiding.<br />
<br />
Obviously we'll see once they get this freagin beta out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the races for druids didnt look so goofy/horrible, I'd probably play one for sure.  As it is, I'm going to wait and see.  I've always enjoyed some flexibility, but I understand that you tend to wind up paying for it in the end with a useless set of skills that nobody else needs/wants or that they already have in some other form.  (Happened in AO to my Fixer too...)<br />
<br />
i.e. if the druid &quot;Tank&quot; form cant actually tank anything at a high level, then that ability is basically useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I certainly HOPE I am wrong :D.<br />
 <br />
I just don't see how they can give druids that much flexibility and have them be as useful in each of those roles as the &quot;real deal&quot;. It would be unfair to that class to have the druid class be as good at their main job AND be able to do all the other stuff druids can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggen</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fewer classes means more possible roles for each class, so versatility need not come with such a steep cost as it has in EQ. Look at how Blizzard appears to be wrapping the Enchanter and Cleric--two of the most historically desirable classes--into one. That's a lot of power to balance against.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind also the skill tree based advancement system in WoW. Just because Druids have a lot of different abilities doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be able to become powerful in all of them at once. Especially at higher levels a skill tree could make versatility versus focused ability a self-correcting problem. We may simply see lots of different kinds of Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be kinda cool if, say, a wow-druid who chose the warrior tree would wind up being about as powerful and capable as a knight hybrid in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dennis</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am actually leaning towards WoW Paladin, if I play the game at all.  I really enjoyed my EQ druid, but the Paladin was one of the more fun classes for me to play.  Unless WoW is radically different from EQ, after reading the class descriptions on WoW's site (and on FoH's), I'm leaning towards Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telaman</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The nice thing about any game like this is that if you don't like the class your playing you can always choose another one. Same thing with EQ you dont HAVE to play a druid! If it doesnt suit you just try something else, I dont think blizzard will restrict people to 1 char like some others have.<br />
<br />
Im going to try a bunch of different classes when WoW finally does come out, thinking of a warlock first followed by a druid atm but if I dont enjoy them then ill keep trying till I find something I do enjoy or quit just like EQ. If youre not having fun then why play after all? :)<br />
<br />
So long as enough testing is done and the classes arnt suddenly nerfed like they often have been in EQ I think WoW should be a fun game.</div></div><hr />

Nice job bumping an 18+ month old thread. :P</div></div><hr />

Was it in Beta like that?  I think stylistically it would be much cooler if it was a bird form (even without the ability to fly more than a few feet off the ground).  I support internal congruence within the backstory.</div></div><hr />
