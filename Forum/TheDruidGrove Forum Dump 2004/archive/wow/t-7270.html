<br />
I think there is an aspect to these games that is spoiled by reading ahead.  The fun of this game (or any other in the genre) for me is seeing how it works first hand.  <br />
<br />
When I played EQ, I played for 15 levels or so before I started looking for third party info on the game (mostly spoilers so I could find the places where worthwhile quests could be found, or know the level ranges for a zone so I could choose hunting grounds).  <br />
<br />
I am trying to keep an eye on WoW because I am curious and will try it but somehow it is just not moving my heart at all.  <br />
<br />
But that isn't really anything new.  I can't think of any game I watched with passion before it was released.  I guess I will see what I will see, and keeping throwing an eye at what is said from time to time.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why I posted this?  I sure don't lol.</div></div><hr />

It was about level 11 when I first started looking for EQ info on the net and that was just for a map of East Commons - that zone was huge back then :)</div></div><hr />

I was half nakkid still, had like NO wis (and didn't until I got to level 50 or so) and was so afraid of some zones you would laugh your butts off at the silly things I would do. Hell, that fear went as far as level 65 where I'd invis through EVERY zone just to move unmolested. If not for those damn skellies in WC ... grrr :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katnips</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I started playing Everquest years ago, I bought the game, expecting to have a new computer that would run it soon.  It took two months however before I was able to get that new computer.  I spent quite a bit of time reading various websites about EQ before I started playing, but it did not diminish the awe and wonder I felt at the game.  My first few weeks were just spent exploring and having fun.<br />
<br />
I have been keeping up with the progress and gameplay of WoW, but I am staying away from quest/spell spoiler sites this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I understand there is like 16k quest - most of them are pretty informative (few here and there confused me.. but sometimes a break helps that) <br />
 <br />
 Let me put it this way - the quest system is what makes this game fun.. you can't have to many quest.. (well actual there is a limit!) you just have to actual do the quest. Some are short.. some are easy.. some are extremely hard.. some need a group.. some need a couple of groups. But in the end.. beyond the Grind.. its just fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quests is what keeps the game moving. It's the only that kept my interest in EQ for so long. Now I've done all quests of interest and the game's came to an end for me.<br />
<br />
Quests is what keeps your mind off the grind of leveling and into the joy of the game. Quests shouldn't be just to get good items, but they should be something to make you have fun while enjoying different aspects of the game. When you don't want to go quests, group with some friends to chill out and have fun.<br />
<br />
A game needs goals. The goal of a game shouldn't be &quot;get lvl 65 and raid&quot;. That makes everybody push for higher levels and stronger gear as fast as possible. Thus introducing the &quot;Level grind&quot; syndrome. I really think Blizzard understands this, and they are doing everything they can to prevent the &quot;Level Grind&quot; syndrome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The quests, the world, the classes, and the way PvP is to be done all have me excited to play this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am annoyed the game thinks i cant count to 10 by myself<br />
<br />
I think its just way too much spoonfeeding<br />
<br />
you dont need spoilers beyond &quot;find a guy with a yellow ! over his head and right click&quot;<br />
<br />
some challenge<br />
<br />
I sure hope once we get past being newbs all this &quot;help&quot; goes away = )</div></div><hr />
