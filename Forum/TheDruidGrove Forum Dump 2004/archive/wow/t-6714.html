<br />
Can you tell us more about the beta? Will there be different phases? Will there be an open beta? Will it require a NDA?<br />
World of Warcraft is currently in the alpha-testing stage. The beta test, which is scheduled to start sometime in early 2004, will initially be open to players in the U.S., Canada, and Korea. Participation will not require an NDA. Similarly to how we've conducted beta tests in the past, we will gradually open up the beta to more and more testers in order to gauge server stability and connectivity. While we don't know what the total number of beta testers will be yet, this will by far be our largest beta test ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So WoW will *not* require an NDA?  That's a new one on me.  I thought all betas required an NDA of some sort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they haven't.  It'd be a bad omen for Blizzard to start out in SoE fashion, with a lie. :D</div></div><hr />

Still, no mention that they've been sent out.  Etc etc, blah blah.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Once again we thank everyone for participating in our World of Warcraft beta test signups. Currently, we are reviewing the applications thoroughly, and we will notify selected testers by email before the start of each beta phase. Only selected testers will receive an email from Blizzard. Notification is slated to go out in the weeks ahead. Please stay tuned to www.blizzard.com for more information and extensive coverage on World of Warcraft.&quot;<br />

Obviously there is really nothing new here, but mainly they posted it to let people know that emails haven't gone out yet/not beta yet.</div></div><hr />

(and i'm damn glad it was, the finished product was well worth the wait) Blizzard is notorious for refusing to release a game til it's damn well ready, something I applaud them for.<br />
<br />
As much as i'm eager to know if i'll get a beta spot, i'd rather wait for a better product to begin testing on than rush matters like another company with a name that's four letters beginning with an S and ending with a y that releases buggy crap for beta and doesn't improve a damn thing by the end of the beta...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you say Daikatana?<br />
<br />
How about Duke Nukem Forever (and ever and ever.)<br />
<br />
Be patient, but dont assume that it's gonna be perfect just because it takes a month or two longer than we'd like.  Worst thing you can do is set your hopes and expectations so high as to be disappointed by reality when it arrives.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you can infer anything at all about a game from that.</div></div><hr />
