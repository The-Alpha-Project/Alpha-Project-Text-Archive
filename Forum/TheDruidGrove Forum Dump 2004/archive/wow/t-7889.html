<br />
When asked about taming a certain giant named Gorilla Tigole responded that we wasn't tamable, though he did let slip:<br />
On a side note, you will be able to tame elite mobs and many *unique* named beasts. Taming an alite mob will not give it any bonus hit points, however. The only reason you'd want to do this would be for cosmetic reasons (you like the way that particular beast looks) or else to procure a beast with special abilities. <br />
<br />
And further down the same post he released the most info we've seen on hunters yet:<br />
Helboars are technically demons, so you would not be able to tame one. Although Warlocks will find some fun uses for them &gt;=] <br />
<br />
Also, Black Drakes fall under the category of Dragonkin (formerly Dragons, but that was confusing people). So no black drake pets either. <br />
<br />
I've spent the morning playing the hunter. You guys are in for a *serious* treat. The class has so many diverse functions. You can choose to play your hunter in so many different ways. <br />
<br />
Some of his cool abilities include: <br />
<br />
Beast taming -- choose a beast, tame it, name it. <br />
Beast training -- teach your beast new abilities. <br />
Traps -- these rule... many different uses <br />
Stings -- special shots that debuff your enemy <br />
Beast lore -- get special information about beast targets <br />
Aspects -- a cool line of buffs <br />
Beast fear -- run away little doggy <br />
<br />
There is so much more that I am leaving out. <br />
<br />
Now the only problem I can see with any of that is that there's going to be FAR too many hunters next push.<br />
<br />
