We were surprised to find out that some of you still had questions about the game. Just kidding; we weren’t really surprised. The dev. team is working hard to prepare the next beta patch, but we did manage to snag some time with EnoYls, who provided the bulk of the answers below. Thanks go out to everyone who helped put together this Q&amp;A, and thanks to you all for bringing up some good topics for discussion. <br />
<br />
What should players expect in the World of Warcraft end-game? That is, is there an end-game for casual gamers as well as power gamers, small guilds, groups of friends, large guilds, etc.? <br />
<br />
New content will be continuously added into the game and players can always expect to see new events and things for them to do and achieve in the game. Players that do eventually hit the level cap will have the option to participate in a variety of end-game content, such as: <br />
<br />
Individual players can work toward a hero class. <br />
<br />
The PvP System will be more advanced than it is today -- including the addition of rewards. <br />
<br />
Guilds will have an extensive amount of raid content available to them with many zones and &quot;uber&quot; bosses to defeat.<br />
<br />
