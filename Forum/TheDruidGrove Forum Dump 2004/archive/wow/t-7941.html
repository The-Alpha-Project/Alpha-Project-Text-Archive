Anyway, I am doing the final part of the quest for night elves called &quot;Crown of the Earth&quot; where I have to find some arch druid in the Druid grove which is somewhere in Darnasius(SP) I think.  Problem is that it seems like I have looked everywhere in Darnasius(SP) and yet I can't find this place.  I am currently at the entrance of Darnasius(SP).  Can anyone plz help me??  Thx.</div></div><hr />

There's another druid way north of the road just before you get to town at one of those moonpools.... anyways, I can't remember :D.</div></div><hr />

The priest area is opposite this to the left of the bank and well worth going into just to look.  Very pretty in the temple there :).<br />
<br />
Hope those directions are enough to help you find it!</div></div><hr />
