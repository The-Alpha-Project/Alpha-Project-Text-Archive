<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been the debate for almost five years in Everquest.  Other games have attempted to find some way to thread the needle...and unfortunately failed.  Either coming out with a bland game geared towards casual play (SWG) or a game geared so much towards uberosity as to make it unfun (Eve).<br />
<br />
Now World of Warcraft enters the fray with their own ideas and attempts to maintain both the interest of the Casual player and the interest of the Uberguild players.<br />
<br />
Weighing in on the casual side is their stated goal of having every class be solo capable, instanced settings, and a plethora of quests (Yet, fortunately, staying away from the generic and repetative quest generation modal of DAOC, E&amp;B, AO, SWG, and others).  They've also powerful equipment will be available to the soloist and small groups through hunting and crafting.  Then again, Sony says this repeatedly as well about EQ.<br />
<br />
Aside all of this is the promise, yet, of guild sized and even server sized events.  Raid targets.  Promising the best of the best gear to the raid players, as it were.<br />
<br />
As seen already, the Casual vs Uber debate begins anew.<br />
<br />
Having been on both sides of the issue during my EQ days, and now looking back through neutral eyes, I can only say this. <br />
<br />
A game needs both.  You need plenty of worthwile things for casual players to do, or you will lack your player base.  <br />
<br />
However, you also need a steady stream of raid encounters for the &quot;uber&quot;players.  Without it, the game lacks meaning and purpose.  While a casual player may resign himself to never reaching that level...more frequently the casual player will find himself at one point of his &quot;Career&quot; trying the uber route.  To see how the &quot;other half&quot; live and to try and get his hands on some of that &quot;phat lewt&quot;.  You need something for the &quot;little people&quot; to dream of and strive for.<br />
<br />
Games like SWG and Shadowbane, for instance, lack that.  When you wake up one day (usually in the first week or two) and realize you own composite armor already and the best weapon your profession can use...you wonder is that really all there is?<br />
<br />
Everquest provided the players with various levels of difficult to aquire gear.  Which is one big reason why they managed to hook and keep so many people.  From the days of the original class armors and planar armors, to the latter days of Ornate, there was a progression of things to strive for in the game.<br />
<br />
From all accounts, WoW understands this lesson from EQ.  The questions now are, have they learned it and how well can they implement it?  Its difficult to balance gear for casuals which is good gear, yet to create raid only gear which is worth creating a raid to obtain...yet isn't so far beyond what a casual player can hope to get as to breed dissention.<br />
<br />
As of now, I have faith in the developers of WoW to design challenging and dynamic raid content.  I hope they can do the same for the casual player as well.  By all accounts they certainly aim to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyll</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried to be a power gamer in EQ but never got enough time and was always behind playing catchup. One of THE main reasons I want to try WoW is because you can solo with any class. Grouping should be the focus of MMORPG's but it shouldn't be the ONLY possibility. Now Blizzard claims every class can solo... well in EQ you could if you spent enough time at it but the reward vs risk was horrible and the exp per time invested was utter crap. I expect Blizzards claims that every class can solo mean that exp gains will be comparable to groups.<br />
<br />
From the sounds of things I think WoW will be more suited for the casual gamer to enjoy without feeling the great pressure to max level asap. Certainly there will be a push to do this but I don't expect it will take 6 months for a casual gamer to catch up. With quests (at least at early levels) giving a good chunk of exp instead of virtually nothing I expect exploring to be more fun cause you will still be advancing even if it's slower than killing. The power gamers may fade a lot quicker than EQ die hards but as a casual gamer I have no problems with that. Nearly every 'l33t' I've met runs around calling others 'n00bs' to feel special.<br />
<br />
With instances casual gamers don't have to compete with power gamers for spawns a la Ragefire (old rage, not the skyfire version obviously). I think power gamers get satisfaction in 'dominating' servers like this and without it they will become bored quicker. Maybe they'll make a faction switch after awhile and try the game from the other side. Certainly adds a whole new game experience. In that respect I think the hardcore and casual will thoroughly enjoy WoW and Blizzard has done as good as can be expected on a subject that has no solution IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elven-marksman</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a player who loves &quot;casual gameplay&quot;. Its not that I dont like joining up with mass forces. Doing so can be fun, but I prefer to perfect my skills by myself! I dont like having a Clan give me all I need to start with in the first week Ive been online. <br />
<br />
At this point Im not sure what class Ill be going with. Most MMORPS's claim to have great solo play, so when I first start playing them I design a wandering mage. Only after playing for a week I realize that there is no such thing, that its impossible to be a wondering mage becasue anything less than an entourage gets owned, HARD! So I would love to be my wandering mage, and help those that need help, and kill those who I see are in need of killing! (Im a bit obssed with Merlin) <br />
<br />
So if this turn out to be the same as everyother MMORPG's I'm going to be very dissapointed. Blizzard has always done well in the past so I have great faith, but Im an analystic optimist. I realize that it might not be all that it promises to be.</div></div><hr />

Powergamers can constantly strive to be better than the next in line in the arena's.  I too am a casual MMORPG player, not due to any choice, but due to time restrictions (family, work, responsibility etc.).  But i too became discouraged in other MMORPG's that ensured only those who spent 8 hours a day in game could be successful.  WoW is the game for me regardless, i'm sure i'll even just enjoy RP'ing my bigass Tauren Druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggen</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think of the instanced dungeons and questing system.

At least, that's what I encountered in EQ.  There really wasn't suitable content for casual players once you had maxed out your level.  It was very repetitive and dull and with few upgrades or adventures to look forward to.<br />
<br />
They sort of addressed it in LDoN, at least the upgrade part, but the fun level of the encounters was minimal.</div></div><hr />

Once you get up in level even a little ways you need a guild to keep moving up. Guilds aren't all bad, but the politics get stale. Plenty of that irl....</div></div><hr />

THERE NEED BE NO &quot;SILVER PLATTER&quot; DEBATES UNTIL THERE IS SOMETHING TO DEBATE!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fairweather Pure</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The job of the public relations dept for any new game is to tell you everything you want to hear.  When the game is released, the truth comes out.  While I would like to believe every class will be able to solo in WoW, I simply refuse to give in to PR hype without experiancing it myself.  Many new MMORPG have made the same claims and have not delivered.  I mean, if you want to get technical, every class in EQ can solo too.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Btw, if there is not an uber vs. casual debate withing 2 months of WoW going live, the game will not have legs.  I just hope both sides get treated equal when Blizzard is developing/improving content.  Like it or not, raid content, uber loot and bragging rights are all essential parts of a successful MMORPG.  Without them, a player has no sense of where he stands in the community in which he plays.  It is that sense of accomplishment and progression that has kept EQ going all these years.  As fun as a game may be, you have to engage players on a whole other level in order to garner support for years of dedicated play.  <br />
<br />
I'm also concerned about content.  Players eat content alive as it is.  If hardcore EQ and other MMORPG veterans take a chance on WoW, I hope Blizzard realizes that we will tear through the content in no time.  Many people put in 30-40 hours a week with 50-80 of our guildmates in EQ and  we have been doing so for years.  We'll be approaching encounters in WoW with cold, military percision and I anticipate the majority of encounters will be geard towards the B.net crowds so the vetrans will waltz all over everything.  I hope Blizzard plans multiple expansions/updates per year in order to feed the player's appetite.<br />
<br />
As soon as I log in and find nothing I want to do/accomplish, I'm gone.  Keep me busy and I'll keep paying :)<br />
<br />
Go uber!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydex</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW is trying to steal a few top EQ guilds as a whole to test the top teirs of the content. When they roll out beta 2 or 3 I imagine the push will be levels 30 to 60. I have heard that they are offering to give guilds that come in mass and have some skill in EQ all pre leveled characters so they can jump right into the high level content. This would also make such guilds fall out of the EQ loop, so to say, for a few months.    <br />
    <br />
Yet, giving people level 60 characters does not mean they will be able to play them with any skill and test the content thoroughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These games are not rocket science. Anyone who thinks playing a MMORPG taking &quot;skill&quot; is deluded. A monkey could be trained to do a cheal rotation in EQ, or be the main tank.<br />
<br />
So even if you do give people pre-leveled characters, the ones that actually *want* to test things will be hardcore enough to spend some time playing around and figuring it out (that is, afterall, most people's goal, to get a leg up on the competition come release time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggen</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's more discipline than skill. Successful guilds are comprised of attentive, dedicated people who work well in a team and can stick to a plan. Leadership qualities also play a major role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BGrifter</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really I don't think EQ got the balance that horribly wrong. Obviously i'm somewhat biased having played a Druid and as such being able to solo from 1 to 65 and an ungodly amount of AAs beyond, but really I never felt particularly threatened by content that was beyond my reach for a while. <br />
<br />
Casual guilds and open raids are now progressing thru POP on all servers at a pretty steady pace, some having reached PoTime, others in the EPlanes for a while. Obviously the same won't be happening with GOD for a while, but given time eventually it'll fall to the casual player just as POP did. (well, if EQ survives that long *grins and cues the wardrums of WoW*) I truly hope that WoW contains raiding content that with a little patience can be conquered by a casual raiding alliance raiding a couple nights a week, but I see no reason a group of people willing to invest five nights a week, or even seven, shouldn't get there first.</div></div><hr />

&lt;br&gt;<br />
Hmmm, been playing 5 months as a (SOLO) druid, level 52, moving faster now then in my 40's and 30's...guild member but RARELY do anything with them, and mostly helping other lower level's learn to group. My 37 Ranger also solos, made that level in 3 months...&lt;BR&gt;<br />
I play maybe 3-4 hours a night, 2-4 days a week...thats 6-16 hours a week depending on RL....I may never see those raid encounters, maybe one day try to join a &quot;casual&quot; guild where my work and family come 3rd and 2nd to EQ and I can do some lower planes level stuff, but honestly I feel groups slow me down, I see everything I want and will join groups for other things when they pop up, but rarely.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
I guess I'm one of those people who see things as &quot;anythings possible&quot; and try to find a way to get it done. But I surely don't need a guild to progress in the game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarf</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think EQ pushes people into armies by its design.<br />
<br />
Large armies of players are able to do things more effectively then small guilds.<br />
<br />
If hanging out with 80 of your closest friends is what makes you happy, then EQ is the game for you.<br />
<br />
But if they had made instanced zones with max 18 people entering the zone, then people would be in guilds of 20 or less more often.  It is relatively easy to design a game to reach your goals, whatever they are.<br />
<br />
The ubers aren't the ones who have made EQ the game that it is.  It is the social people that did that.  Finding a way to keep teh social people should be the goal of the game.  Fostering community and making them all want to keep playing.<br />
<br />
The ubers are running a race and will quit the game when they feel they have won the race.  How many people in your resident uber guild have quit every time a new expansion is beaten?  How many times does an uber guild have to open recruiting in order to have sufficient numbers to raid?  How many guild accounts have to be botted in EQ in order to have enough of class X.<br />
<br />
i don't know the answer to these questions, never having been in such a guild, but I do know that a great many people have left small guilds to join uber guilds in order to see content, NOT because it was their first choice in how to play the game.<br />
<br />
I also know many ubers who have quit the game once they beat it.  They often come back for a few weeks when a new expansion comes out, but then thats it.<br />
<br />
When WoW comes out, hopefully my guild will all quit EQ with me and we will all start playing WoW together.  I don't think we are an isolated phenomena.  I think EQ will become a ghost town and frankly, I think that is because of SoEs focus of developing content primarily for end game raiders.<br />
<br />
I am sure there will be someoen who thinks the flags are a good thing.  Most of those folks are people who spent 100s of hours getting flags and now want to enjoy the privileges of the privileged class.<br />
<br />
They want to be able to kick back and say &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;.  Just like in the old days.</div></div><hr />
