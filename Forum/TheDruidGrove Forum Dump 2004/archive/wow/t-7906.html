We expect to implement the new patch for the World of Warcraft beta in the very near future. We don’t have an exact date yet, but we wanted to pass along an important piece of info to help everyone be prepared. The patch will modify the levels of several items, so if your character has an item equipped and no longer meets the requirements for that item, the item will be removed. If your character has bag slots open, then each item removed will go into an available bag slot. However, if your character does not have bag slots open, the item will be sucked into the Emerald Dream, where it will wait for you until you clear enough bag space to hold the items. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to log out and then log back in to have the items appear in your bags. Please help spread the word.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully by this evening I'll be using it.  They really boosted it though.  47.8 DPS on a one hander /drool.  If they boosted the whelp level also...I'm golden!</div></div><hr />

I sure wish I could have got my husband's Warrior one.  Post all the info/stats on it (I'm going to be out of town this weekend and need lots of reading).  Man, his best is like 39 dps right now.  I heard Soul'Thraze got boosted too to like 60 (but it's a 2h).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway I've been trying to look at faq's and doing some searches and I can't find out for sure what I need.  I know they said you could remap your keys.  I'd like to know about movement in the game.  I can't use mouse controls as I get motion sick from it, so just making sure I can move using either the arrow keys or wasd without having to use the mouse.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for any help, and again sorry for posting it this way.  I've emailed about not having access to start the thread so hopefully next time I have a question it will be right :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll try to remember to check tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Also make sure Rah and/or Sobe know about the posting issue =)</div></div><hr />

I believe it was SW:G where you could move back and forth with keys, but had to use the mouse to turn?  Anyway, one of the games that came out rather recently, and I just felt kind of sick everytime I played.<br />
<br />
I emailed Rahjeir about it a couple of days ago, I'm sure he'll get it straightened out soon, but for now I'm glad you found this post.  Thanks again for the help and crossing fingers, I'd so love to try this game.</div></div><hr />
