<br />
<br />
It was mentioned long ago that pvp events would be hosted on regular servers and pvp servers alike, in special instanced battlefield areas. Similar to Battlefield 1942, two sides would get the chance to fight over key objective(s). <br />
<br />
It was also said that by entering neutral or hostile areas you could have a chance to find cosmetically different items. <br />
<br />
My questions are as follows: When will we get to see this awesome stuff in the game? <br />
<br />
Has anyone found any items in pvp areas that look cooler than normal items yet? <br />
<br />
More importantly, can we expect special instanced areas where the objectives are different, like, one side has to seige a city while the other defends? <br />

We are working on them now, but they are still a little ways away from being patch-worthy. I would guess-timate 3-4 weeks for base level implemenation. <br />

Sooo, it'll be interesting to see how the battlegrounds work, there was talk in the past of them being instanced into level groups, don't know whether that's a positive or a negative, and it will be interesting to see how collision (or WoW's lack thereof) effects combat on these battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />
