Does this game hold your interest and keep you wanting to log in and play like EQ once did for many of us?  Of coure I know that once that has happened the first time, the other games that follow will never hold the exact same feeling of newness.<br />
<br />
Are you more likely to be playing EQ and think that you would like to log off and play World of Warcraft or vice-versa?  I ask because I just had a friend who was lucky enough to get into beta say that he enjoys the game, but still has more fun with FFXI.</div></div><hr />

I've yet wanted to return to EQ. When I log in to xp with friends, the words that come out of my mouth are, &quot;Ewwwww&quot;.<br />
<br />
I havn't played FFXI so I wouldn't know if it's more fun then WoW. I do like it more then EQ though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lineage 2 does the same, except it has sexier models. LOL. For me, not enough reason to endure a grind that makes EQ look easy. <br />
<br />
City of Heroes... now... I enjoy this one. Servers just went down for 3 days, and I'm already fiending. With the changes Blizzard is making to WoW, CoH looks more and more fun. EB can't ship me my copy fast enough... :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FFXI just didn't do it for me either, the controls drove me crazy.<br />
<br />
I really had fun in CoH for the time I was in beta, however I may not purchase the game because I don't feel it will offer enough to keep me interested for very long.  Mostly because I love to craft and to even just run around and shop.  I like having things to do other than fight in a game.  It is a fun game to play and I imagine people who don't craft will enjoy it much longer than those of us who do.</div></div><hr />

EQ is just a chore now.  All the good people are gone.  Its an exercise is watching the inhumanity to man in full action.<br />
<br />
I have been enjoying Horizons.  Its more my style, however, I know there is little to do once you reach &quot;the top&quot; except wait for each week's major event.<br />
<br />
I never again want to play a game that &quot;requires&quot; me to play a certain number of hours in a block to get throug the story.  I don't want the proverbial platter everyone likes to invoke, but I don't want to have to be on well past midnight just so I can find out why the fiends are coming to invade the once peaceful land of the elves or whatever.  Its fun for some people, but not for me.<br />
<br />
I DO like it when I can always have something I can do even if I don't have 70 other people who want to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has done well in the past so they earn a look at their product.<br />
<br />
I saw some rumor that Furor was writing the quest content for WOW?  That seems odd and I hope it isn't the case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galamar</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it is true, then it sounds like a good move to me. Already WoW quests are top notch.  It looks like Blizzard is mostly doing the typical bottom-up approach to quest writing - start low and work your way up the levels.  Furor is EQ's most public and vocal powergamer and is almost always on the leading edge of new high level content and one of the first to give it reviews.  Given his experience in the subject it would be a good idea to have him on the quest design team.  Note that it is a team.  Chances are he's paid to come up with ideas that would be fun for other gamers.  The designers and rest of the team are the ones that will actually impliment them.  It's not like he would be writing the quest content by himself in any meaningful way.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard wants to use that experience for their own high end stuff, well it sounds like a good idea to me.</div></div><hr />

While I can't stand Furor, you can't overlook what he did, or others.</div></div><hr />
