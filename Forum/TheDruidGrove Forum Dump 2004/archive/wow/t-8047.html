With an innovative, easy-to-use interface, an action-packed combat system, and thousands of quests that build an immersive storyline, World of Warcraft offers a MMORPG that will appeal to both veteran and casual players alike.<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft has been our largest undertaking to date,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president and co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;When we set out to create a massively multiplayer online game, our goal was to expand the scope of the Warcraft universe by offering an incredibly dynamic game experience. We're extremely proud of the game we've created, and we believe players will be very pleased when they see what we have in store for them.&quot;<br />

World of Warcraft will be available for Windows® 98/ME/2000/XP and Macintosh® formats at a suggested retail price of $49.99 in the U.S., and will include a free one-month subscription to the game.
