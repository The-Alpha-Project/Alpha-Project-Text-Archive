<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only been playing for a few days now, but I wanted to chime in real quick with a note on tradeskills.  So far I've played my night elf druid up to only level 12, so take anything I say with the appropriate caution.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say that taking Herbalism, Alchemy, and Enchanting as your trades, at least initially, is absolutely fantastic for a druid.  Herbalism of course being the &quot;gathering&quot; trade that gets you the items you need to use both Alchemy and Enchanting.  After a relatively short time at these trades I can constantly have all sorts of useful buff effects on myself via the use of potions, as well as some neat permanent and temporary effects for the armor I'm wearing.  And the only real time cost here for me is clicking the &quot;find herbs&quot; button every 3 minutes or so at my current rank(will be 5 minutes at rank 2) and occasionally diverting my course slightly to pick some herbs when I see them pop up on the mini map.<br />
<br />
Now sure, I could be doing skinning and leatherworking to make myself armor, or some combination of other fun skills like fishing, survival and cooking, but...really, I just have to say, in terms of overall usefulness and empowerment as a druid, the combination of Herbs, Alchemy and Enchant is the win in my book!<br />
<br />
(And the image in my mind of the wandering druid, pouches overflowing with herbs and clanking potion bottles is also cool)</div></div><hr />

At level 18ish I had alot of skill points to train in Herbalism, Alchemy, and Enchanting. Working on maxing them all.</div></div><hr />

Survival just lets you make campfires and light torches for a Spirit (mana/hp regen) boost.  For tough fights, I'd light a campfire and bring the fight back to camp.  If you're just going to be healing (or have trained a 1-handed weapon skill, you can carry a torch in your off hand for a spirit boost for the whole party on a dungeon crawl.</div></div><hr />
