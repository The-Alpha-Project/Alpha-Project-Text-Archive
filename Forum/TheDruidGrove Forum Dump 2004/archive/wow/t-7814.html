Some people have said, I can get a better deal through such and such website. I said sure.. if you want your site to be on a beat up single processor server with 1000 other accounts on it .. and of course you may get an OC48 connection.. just maybe. The difference is we offer speed, we offer a Gigabite Network Backbone, we offer an OC192 Connection, and finally our Server kicks ass - Quad (thats 4) Xeon Pentium 2.8 running this bad boy and a full back up done daily with a Raid 5 for Security. <br />
