<br />
Whether WoW turns out to live up to the hype (unlike SWG) is another question, and one that beta won't answer.   And whether it is good enough to cause current EQ gamers to switch won't be answered for a while, either.</div></div><hr />

The two games are in the same fantasy genre and probably quite similar in many respects.  They are going to share the same target audience.<br />
<br />
It is also incumbent upon WoW to be a good enough game to woo away EQ subscribers in order to make a sizeable dent in EQ.  But I suspect there a lot of EQ players who are curious enough to check it out and some of them won't be coming back.</div></div><hr />

Each server can support 2,000 to 3,000 players.&quot;<br />
<br />
If that's the case and 400,000 people play WoW when it comes out, Blizzard will need <br />
about 135 servers.  I'm assuming they mean 2-3000 players simultaneously though.<br />
<br />
However, I'm curious where they got their figures.  If it is true, WoW is going to be absolutely huge.  The amount of applicants they got just for beta is almost the same amount of customers EverQuest has and more than just about every other existing MMOG.<br />
<br />
I think I'll wait til I see something from Blizzard or Vivendi before I believe the validity of those numbers.</div></div><hr />

I hope the high-end EQ players in WoW dev. team and the avenue they have through them to the current high-end EQ community, will show in how they have chosen to implement raiding to the game.<br />
<br />
I would have applied to the beta myself, had they chosen to include europe on this first phase.<br />
<br />
I don't entirely agree with the same target audience, though. I firmly believe that WoW will draw in people from communities that wouldn't otherwise be interested in MMORPGs, simply because of their history and, like pointed out earlier, massive, non-mmorpg, fanbase.<br />
<br />
Considering this is largely bnet.com audience, it remains to be seen whether it is a good or bad thing. ;)<br />
<br />
Of course, it might be only because we define target audience differently.<br />

EDIT: fixed a sentence to make bit more sense. &quot;I hope the high-end EQ players in WoW dev. team and the avenue...&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I loved playing D2 solo, in a private PW game so I wouldn't be tempted to put in those cheat codes.<br />
<br />
I never bothered to buy the expansion though, cause I was busy with EQ, and have since lost my D2 discs /cry<br />
<br />
I've even had a hankering to play it again, I just can't justify buying the game again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should buy it again with the expansion, its still worth the money<br />
<br />
You have to remember that battlenet is free, and as such has quite a diverse crowd of people, but yeah it can be pretty ghetto.  I dont expect WoW with its monthly fee and suscription system to be anything like D2 on battlenet.<br />
<br />
I play D2 single player only.<br />
<br />
I know most of the people I know in EQ are drooling over WoW, and we really hope it will live up to what we expect out of it.<br />
<br />
EQ2 just doesnt seem to be as attractive yet, nothing really new.  Graphics arent enough for me to pay for a game.</div></div><hr />

Take a Warcraft III map, but you have other players on it, with friendly mobs you can command and unfriendly mobs you can attack on it, along with resources and structures to destroy to &quot;win&quot;.  Being a rogue in WoW might actually be rogue-like instead of a fury of blades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aly, I think the key to having fun rogue abilities is that hide/sneak has to be more limited than it is in EQ.   For instance, in Morrowind H/S is pretty risky, especially for the first 50-60 levels of it.   So you do get caught a lot!  But without that feeling of &quot;oh ****, can I sneak past this guard without getting caught&quot; feeling, there isn't much excitement in being a rogue.<br />
<br />
The difference is, if you get caught in Morrowind, you can probably survive it because you can fight toe-to-toe, unless you're just overwhelmed with badguys.  And if you can't... you can always restore from a save point. :p<br />
<br />
And I think it sounded to me like rogues in WoW will have a much more variable sneak/hide ability. Hopefully we'll have good reason to use the ability!  <br />
<br />
For instance, in Morrowind, you could generally do quests in several ways.  You could go kill someone for the thing you need.  Or you could go try to fast talk them.  That took a lot of bribery and using your speechcraft skill.  You might be able to convince them to give you what they had that you needed.  And failing that, you could try to steal it from them!   I generally took the route of non-violence when I could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I understand sneak/hide shouldn't be the uber invisibility it is in EQ.  Especially once you get Shroud, but there has to be something else to do that's rogue like as well.  There have to be reason to use those abilities for quests, instead of always resorting to slaughtering the mob to get the drop.  Rogue epic is the only quest in game that requires pick pocket.  That's a big mistake.<br />
<br />
There just aren't enough locked doors in the game as well.  There aren't very many visible clues for traps either.  If they could integrate that with the sense trap skill it'd be awesome.  I'd rather have clues to look for in game than pushing a button and seeing if I found a trap or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked how NWN did traps.  You could see them, on the floor, if your skill was good enough.  The hard part about traps and locks is that a MMORPG has got to make them resolvable without a rogue.  Otherwise everyone is tied to a rogue.  Which is great for rogues, not so good for everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Every Blizzard game I have played have been FUN, enjoyable to play, and a blast multi-player (local LAN).  I tend to avoid battlenet however.  <br />
<br />
Everything I have read about WoW, so far, leads me to belive that WoW will be no different.  I also expect they will take the time to make it right and not release horribly early (like SWG for instance).  I am looking forward to WoW and I will definately give it a go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hence, the game runs a useful life to what I'd call a top end player of about 3 months before the cheats and hacks become mainstream.  Then the top people move on to the next game.  <br />
<br />
Blizzard does nothing to the hackers / cheaters typically other than attempt to remove the cheat through a series of 5 to 7 patches over 6 months or so.<br />
<br />
EQ, usually the cheat is patched within a couple of weeks with the players using it being banned and their ill gotten gains deleted.<br />
<br />
So, once again, I see a Blizzard game that will be fun and exciting for about 3 months, then someone will released the WoW version of Townkill, Gamblehack, and other stuff.  Figure out how to make you die and drop everything you own so they can ninja it.  Etc.<br />

<br />
Nooo... Blizzard has always had a bad reputation for cheats and hacks for all of their Battle.net games.  Back when the Diablo 2 ladder came out, there were a bunch of &quot;trainer&quot; programs on the net that would allow you to upload god characters to the Blizzard.net servers.  It completely crippled the ladder system - it took Blizzard about a month to address the issue, more than two weeks to even admit it existed.<br />
<br />
Same thing for Starcraft - there's a ton of hacks out there that allow you to use Starcraft cheats on the desktop and upload that information to the server.  This is because a lot of the information is stored on the client and sent passively to the server.  There's not much that Blizzard could do about it.  You only had 20 units of vespine gas and now you have 1000?   Well that's what the client's computer is telling me, so it must be ok!</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE was also not the quickest kid on the block when handling hackers and cheats for a long time (and to some extent still aren't). Perhaps Blizzard can learn from its own mistakes as well as those of SOE?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I wanna start a &quot;sub-discussion&quot; on this one... what company in the MMORPG field has been quicker than SOE to address cheats?<br />
<br />
Well, before you can answer that, I guess you have to divide up the cheats - I think most MMORPG companies have been very good about addressing &quot;game debilitating&quot; issues - the &quot;3 million plat in 1hr&quot; type tradeskill items in EQ, the duping bugs in Asheron's Call, the various server crashes for all of'em...  But after that, it's harder to say... stuff like ShowEQ would require an entire rewrite of how the code gets transmitted to the client so it's been an ongoing issue.  <br />
<br />
For all the complaining we do about SOE's lackluster performance addressing hackers and cheats, can anyone give names of other companies in similar fields who have consistently done better - and a bonus - for as long as SOE/VI's been doing it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They tried real hard to negate ShowEQ by encrypting data.  But, ShowEQ was able to eventually defeat that and in the process became more mainstream because you had to run it on windows instead of Linux.<br />
<br />
I can't answer your question, Stormy, I've only played EQ.  I hope all MMO's take cheating as seriously as EQ.  I remember hearing how bad it was in UO though.<br />
<br />
I suspect that as any game matures it becomes more suspectible to cheating because the internals of the game are better understood.  And then, the more popular the game, probably the bigger and better organized the cheater community is going to be.  :\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vowelumos</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SOE just announced they banned a bunch of accounta not more than a month ago.  Anyone who has played any Blizzard title on-line has seen rampant and widespread cheating going on for years unchecked, even simple well known major exploits have gone for years uncorrected.<br />
<br />
Although Blizzard is not a complete newb in securing on-line games, they have never done anything like this before and their record in other on-line games (non-mmorpg) is in the bad to horrible range.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to WoW, trying to get into Beta and will probally buy it on day 1 no matter what people in Beta say.  I just think it is funny the way people make Blizzard out to be some sort of Godly veteran on-line gaming company that is going to take over the world.<br />

In that environment, Blizzard games have been consistantly the best I've ever played, and I worked for EA (yes, the put out good stuff. too).  That kind of thing won't be doable with a MMORPG, but their approach to game creation really appeals to me.  They think games should be fun.<br />

I stopped playing Team Fortress Classic because of the complexity and previlance of cheating.  Its too bad, too.  I liked it.<br />
<br />
If a game, EQ2, WOW or any other could make doing rogue activities like they are in Thief, that would be great.  That method, however, doesn't require increasing skill points, you actually have to increase your skill.  If you like rogues, Panamah, I encourage you to get thief 1 and 2 (gold even for extra missions).  It will have you feeling that &quot;oh crap&quot; feeling a lot.  I even found myself actually rubbing my fingers together when attempting a pickpocket maneuver.  Not to mention the sweating you do while fiddling with the two lockpick types to pick a door open while you can hear the guard coming down the hall.</div></div><hr />
