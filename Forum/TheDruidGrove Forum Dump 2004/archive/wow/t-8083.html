<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a long download (2 days) I was finally able to get in yesterday.  Here are some quick thoughts just before I head out the door to do some actual work.<br />
<br />
1.  Leveling speed.<br />
<br />
I like the fact that at no time, yet, have I had to grind.  Even in EQ you began the grind at level 1.  Here, I just do quests and level as a side effect.  That is the single greatest thing I'd have to mention if I had just one good thing I could say.<br />
<br />
It also seems that one levels very quickly.  This may be a problem if there isn't a darn lot of 'end-game' things for people to do.  On the other hand, it could be that lagging leveling speeds is what leads to the eventual downfall of MMOGs.  We will have to see how it pans out.<br />
<br />
2.  Death<br />
<br />
Death in this game is, well, almost a joke.  It means nothing to die.  You lose nothing.  On the one hand it means you can try risky things without setting yourself back a month of game time, on the other hand it can and has been exploited.  I won't go into the exploit.   The point is, death in this game means far less than it does in any other game I've played.  With the possible exception of FPS games where you just respawn with a full set of ammo and guns.  This is difficult to address because you don't want the punishment to be so harsh that it puts people off.<br />
<br />
As an example, as a night elf hunter I took the trip across the ocean to the dwarf city.  I was killed on the way by an orc.  Who cares?  It didn't effect me at all.  I spawn as a ghost very near where I died, pick up my corpse and continue on.  Nothing lost, at all.<br />
<br />
3.  Not your other MMOG.<br />
<br />
I hesitate to compare this to EQ, but that is the most popular one around and so is subject to comparison.<br />
<br />
The non grind I mentioned already.  I also noted that the 'named' monsters aren't always in the same place.  In addition, they 'pop' very fast.  Perhaps gone are the days of camp claiming.  You can be constantly doing something in this game.  So far.  I am, after all, only level 9 from one partial day of play.  The game is still in the enthusiastic beginner phase.<br />
<br />
Downtime is minimal if it exists at all.  Once a fight is over you heal up very fast.  So do the monsters (I've always been an advocate of 'if the player can do it, so can the monsters' and vice-versa.)<br />
<br />
4.  You are not your equipment.<br />
<br />
One final thought.  So far, this game isn't about your equipment.  Items are everywhere and nothing so far is a 'must have' item like in another game we know.  You can be your character and not have it be all about getting the planar armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think the death penalty they have now is a bit harsh.  A 10% durability loss on all your items, even non-equipped items, adds up to a lot of coin, especially for a low level.  If you take the spirit healer rez (and there are apparently some instances where you are forced to do this) the 100% durability hit is way too much.<br />
<br />
To try it out and see how bad it really was, I started a new Tauren Druid.  I only had 2 deaths before reaching level 8 and I spent no money other than repairing my equipment and buying skills/spells.  When I dinged level 8 I had no money to buy any of my spells yet.  I kind of loosely kept track of my repair costs (wish I had written it down to be sure), but I estimate that I'd have enough cash for about half my spells if not for the repair costs.  So it's not a lot of money, but it's a major annoyance.  And that's only with 2 deaths.<br />
<br />
The other comments you made I agree with.  I love the questing aspect of this game and how named mobs are handled.  The best part is, that if you have a quest involving a named mob, it's usually to kill it.  You can group with others who may be 'camping' that mob and with one kill you all get credit for the quest.  If it's a collection quest where you need the mob's head or something, I think everyone in the group that participates in the combat gets to loot the head (I've seen some cases where this was bugged, but it's supposed to work that way anyway).  No more griefing other players over named spawns - it's wonderful.<br />
<br />
In Everquest and other games, I have never been surprised when I dinged a new level.  I was always so focused on the xp bar and watching it creep up after every kill that I was always ready for the ding.  In WoW, there are numerous times that I've been surprised to level.  I get so focused on the quest I'm working on that I totally ignore the xp bar for the most part.  That is great!<br />
<br />
Some of the quests are really inventive and unique too.  Lots of the Tauren quests have a very mystical feel to them.  For example, one I did this morning with my new druid was in 2 parts.  The first part required you to gather ingredients for a special drink.  These are lying around the world in various places (and only people with the quest active can pick them up).  You collect them and take them back to the quest giver.  He then mixes a potion for you and you drink it.  The drink causes you to have a vision of a ghost wolf apparition that you must then follow across the land to the next NPC in the quest series.<br />
<br />
There's also a shaman quest that I did the other day on an Orc shammy.  You drink a potion and it gives you special Elemental Sight that lets you find an NPC.  This Sight stays with you for a while though, so later when I came to a village of trolls, there was a Witch Doctor dancing around a fire there.  With the Sight on, I could see other ghostly figures dancing around the fire with him as part of his ritual.  When the Sight wore off, they weren't there any more - could have been coincidental timing, but I think I was only seeing them because of the Sight power I had.  That was kind of cool :)<br />
<br />
Sure there are &quot;go here and kill 10 xxx for me&quot; quests, but they aren't the only quests you get like other games.  There's a good variety and like you said, there's always something to do :)<br />
<br />
*edit* bah, typos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quinalla</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) The are very much aware that the leveling speed is fairly fast and they intend to keep it that way.  They are also very aware that end-game content will be needed.  Now, I don't know if they will get as much into release as we all might like, but they certainly are trying to.  See this article for their end-game take: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/raid-article.html<br />
2) It isn't too bad now with the repair penalty.  I like this penalty too since it affects folks at all levels including those who are maxed.  It still needs some tweaking, but it isn't too bad IMO.<br />
3) Yeah, questing is the way to go in WoW and it really helps to make you forget about the exp bar.  It is great!<br />
4) Well, equipment is important, but yeah it isn't too hard to get stuff through questing and just random mob drops.  If that isn't enough, the auction house has plenty of stuff typically.  I haven't heard of any must-haves either, so that is good!</div></div><hr />
