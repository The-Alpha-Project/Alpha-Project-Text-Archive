Probably a side effect of having to create an installer with the latest patches built in for the upcoming stress test.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is now a 0.9.1 Installer (this installs the 0.9.1 version of the game, which is the current version as of August 30). This replaces the previous installer we had available for download. If you are currently playing, you do not need to download this file, but if you need to reinstall World of Warcraft for any reason, we suggest you download and use this installer, as it will get you back online with fewer patches to apply. <br />
<br />
Because I like to keep a copy of the install files around I figured I'd grab the new package (because patching in a pain).  The new downloader that's in use was cruising along at a nice 850Kbps (still Bit-Torrent based), so it looks like Blizzard is making strides with the downloader as well.<br />
