<br />
Major Changes<br />
(detailed information for each below)  <br />
<br />
Durability<br />
<br />
Item durability costs have been greatly decreased for Superior (blue) and Epic (purple) items. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Unstuck<br />
<br />
We've added an auto-unstuck feature that you can use prior to petitioning a GM. You can use this feature in situations where you are caught in a part of the terrain and cannot get out. You can find the unstuck option by clicking on the &quot;Help Request&quot; button found on the bottom right hand side of the user interface.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit Healer<br />
<br />
Using the Spirit Healer now results in a 25% loss in durability for a player's equipped gear and items in inventory, instead of the previous 100% loss. The length of resurrection sickness suffered from using the Spirit Healer has also been decreased to a maximum of 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Reagents<br />
Reagent requirements have been removed from the following spells: <br />
<br />
Druid: Mark of the Wild <br />
Mage: Arcane Intellect <br />
Priest: Power Word: Fortitude <br />
 <br />
General Changes<br />
(detailed information for each below)  <br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
The Daze effect has been reworked to have a smaller chance of occurring against players level one to 29. The chance of a successful Daze effect against players 30 and above remains the same. <br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
The Improved Renew talent has been reduced in effectiveness per rank. <br />
The effect chance of Seal of Command has been reduced slightly. <br />
Redoubt now lasts either 10 seconds or five blocks, whichever comes first. <br />
The effect of Improved Moonfire has been reduced per rank. <br />
<br />

<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
Feint: increased the effect, added a cooldown. <br />
<br />

<br />
New Spell: Reincarnation (Level 30). Reincarnation is a passive ability that will give you the option of letting you resurrect yourself once every half hour upon death. <br />
<br />
Warlock<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />

Damage modifiers will now be calculated before armor points are considered, instead of after. <br />
<br />
[Edit] It also seems that Blizzard is no longer using a torrent patcher system. There was much joy.</div></div><hr />
