I didn't go into much detail regarding PvP, but Andy did inform me that a new server would be launched for beta, with the sole purpose of testing PvP. The only other question I had about PvP was the possibility of siege warfare, and the capturing of castles and the like. Andy told me that it wouldn't likely be in for release, but eventually we would see things like catapults, ballista's, and perhaps even steam tanks.</div></div><hr />
