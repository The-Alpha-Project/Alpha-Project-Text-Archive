I can log in about 50% of the time, other times I get logged in as anonymous, even though I use the right name/password.  But whether I get logged in correctly or not, I can't post or reply to a topic.  The posting page never loads.  This is in Firefox.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having that problem too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try using IE(or Avant/Netcaptor for a better IE based browser), as I've heard that some people have a lot of trouble with Firefox on their forums for some reason. Other than that... the official forums are pretty crappy a lot of the time. Problems logging in, or &quot;Service Unavailable&quot; or the little Grunt Error page, are as common as actually getting the forums =-p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't normally had problems with it in Firefox other than that though :(</div></div><hr />

But right not the forums are down due to an apperently hacker on the forums (oops).</div></div><hr />

The forums are down now since beta has closed, but here's a link of what the hackers did:<br />

I believe it was just some obscure asp coding error that allowed someone to edit the blizzard posts for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

If you have a friend you trust in the US, you can use PayPal to send them money to create a subscription for you. Make sure it's somebody you trust. You don't want them to go off spending your money on something else.</div></div><hr />
