Its indicative that Druids will be fighting the same fight for WoW that we had to fight for EQ if things aren't changed heh.<br />

IMO, having the Druid class as a second-rate healer and meleer would be acceptable if the animal forms didnt suck so bad. No one uses animal forms. They're supposed to be jack of all trades master of none. Right now they are jack of one trade (healer) and gimp of all other. <br />

I'm not in the betat so, I don't know if this guy is right, but it makes you laugh and cry all at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Again, I'm assuming these people know what their talking about and just complaining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's worse tho, is my kitty form (rogue) is better than my rogue atm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:) maybe that's why i'm thinking druids aren't so gimped ATM, I play a druid and a rogue...  Perhaps i should try some other classes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try a mage. LOL.<br />
<br />
They are on vastly different scales of power, not even the same game.<br />
<br />
Mage can kill most anything before it even reaches me. And since you have uber non-stop drinks/food, it takes mere seconds to get ready again. Get into trouble? No problem, AE Root, and your AC buff slows creatures that hit you. And your frost bolt does too.</div></div><hr />

I refuse to test one out at the moment because I don't want to be disappointed when they are reduced.  :)</div></div><hr />

I have a TOUGH time killing elites (I have yet to succeed lol). Once they get on you, they have soooo many hit points, chain rooting/snaring just doesn't seem to be enough...</div></div><hr />
