<br />
I’m pleased to introduce to you our new associate community manager, Tyren. Tyren will be on the forums regularly, reading and responding to your posts and keeping everyone updated on what’s going on in the game. He’ll be joined shortly by two more community team members in the weeks ahead. While Tyren is eager to hit the ground running, please go easy on him until he acquaints himself with his new surroundings =] <br />
<br />
Tyren is in for a rough ride I'm sure :)  But it's good to have someone who's sole purpose is to talk to us again.  :blow:  :grin:  :blow: <br />
