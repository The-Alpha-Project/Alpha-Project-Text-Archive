<br />
So far, my favourite zone overall is Duskwood.<br />
<br />
Atmospherically it's beautiful and consistant, the music is murky and mood setting and the whole area just seems.... perfectly gloomy.  I almost feel like i'm in the film noir section of Azeroth :D<br />
<br />
It's got lots of quests and varied monsters and the NPC scripting fits well.<br />
<br />
Transitioning into the zone is also seamless as the world around you just seems to get gloomy as you get farther in.</div></div><hr />

From the sprawled out Darnassus, to the labyrinthine Stormwind to the ring layout of Ironforge... they have so much character in the way they look.  I think the only one that didn't really impress me is the Undercity... though even the approach to that through the ruins was pretty cool, especially with the throne room.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately you pay the price for how good it looks, FPS there suck.</div></div><hr />

My favorite city is actually Undercity.  ;)   My favorite experience/questing zone is Ungoro crater, very fun place. In terms of general look?  Probably Tanaris or Winterspring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Favorite area would be Stranglethorn Vale, or Hinterlands.</div></div><hr />
