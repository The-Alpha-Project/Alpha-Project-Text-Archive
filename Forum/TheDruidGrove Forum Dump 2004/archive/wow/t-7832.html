<br />
<br />
The next patch is just around the corner (it really is) and I wanted to give you all a quick glance at what’s coming up: <br />
<br />
<br />
The level cap will be increased to 50. <br />
<br />
The Sunken Temple, a dungeon in Swamp of Sorrows, will be opened. <br />
<br />
Many of the quests in The Barrens will be reworked or polished. <br />
<br />
New death graphics will be implemented. <br />
<br />
More sneak peeks to come. Enjoy these tidbits! <br />
<br />

New death graphics... interesting.  It was just the other day I did a /suggest to add more death animations, as always falling on my face was going to make my rogue look less rogue-ish and more brute-ish what with the broken nosed look and all... I guess they were already in the works :)<br />
<br />
The Sunken Temple Dungeon.... I won't get there for a while I'm positive... but the whole idea of a submerged Dungeon just appeals to me on so many levels, especially with Blizz's stylized graphics and Art Department on the job.  I'll try to dig for some screens of it as soon as they're available (as I said, it probably won't be me there taking them though).</div></div><hr />
