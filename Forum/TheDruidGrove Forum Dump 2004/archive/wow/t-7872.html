<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks as though the Forums (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/forums/) for World of Warcraft (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) have been updated to allow quotes at the click of a button and new avatar's based upon the characters in your account.  <br />
The avatars don't necessarily match your character, but they do represent your race and gender.  <br />
Other new information showing up in the side panel includes: Race, Class, Level, Character Name, and Guild.<br />
<br />
A news post hasn't been made on the main WoW (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) page yet, but I imagine one is coming soon.  Looks like a lot of people's signatures on the Official Forums (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/forums/) will be redundant.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
<br />
1) WoW Beta testers now post using one of their wow characters, instead of their WoW account name. Wow posts include the characters’ name, race, class, level, guild and icon. <br />
<br />
2) Text search is now working; you can enter in key words from the main page. The search page has been revamped; New UI for the author / player searches. <br />
<br />
3) New Blizzard poster search page. <br />
<br />
4) Posts from war3 accounts now include their current highest level along with the name of the ladder used to achieve that level. <br />
<br />
5) New quote button / feature. Quoting a message is the same as replying, but the initial text includes the tags around the other posters’ text. <br />
<br />
6) The index page displays one of four colored icons based on forum activity and view history. Refer to the icon legend at the bottom of the index page for more info. <br />
