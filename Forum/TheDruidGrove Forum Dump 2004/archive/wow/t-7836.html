<br />
<br />
Non-combative pets will be added for Horde characters. <br />
<br />
The Blasted Lands will be opened. <br />
<br />
Artisan Herbalism will be added. <br />
<br />
Getting attacked or damaged while on a Nightmare will no longer dismount its master. <br />
<br />
More sneak peeks to come. Enjoy these tidbits! <br />

For example, initially you pay skill points for the apprentice level of the skill, which will let you level it to 75 points.  Once you've gotten it to 75 points, you can't get your skill any higher until you pay skills points for the Journeyman level of the skill, which will let you get skill raises up to 125(150?  something like that).   <br />
<br />
Anyway, Artisan level is the one that allows skill point raises in the 200+ range and it currently isn't in game to be trained for Herbalism even though their are herbs to gather that require skill that high and recipes that call for those herbs in other crafts.</div></div><hr />
