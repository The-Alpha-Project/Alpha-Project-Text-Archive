Things aren't as bad now thanks to Pot9 and the healing boost giving us a role on raids as backup healers, but it wouldn't be difficult for WoW to fall into the same trap.<br />
<br />
Mark of the Wild looks promising, it could be the Pot9 of WoW which would go a long way towards making at least a couple Druids desirable on a raid. Beyond that it will likely depend on our healing capabilities. With a little luck &quot;versatility&quot; will mean you can allocate your skill points and specialize in a variety of things, rather than being able to do many things poorly. One druid can choose to focus on damage dealing in cat form, another tanking in bear, a third as a healer primarily in Night Elf/Tauren form. I'll happily sacrifice power in the other two forms for a boost as a healer.</div></div><hr />

 WoW &quot;Druids&quot; sound again like a generalist class, with the ability to do a lot of stuff, at an &quot;ok&quot; proficiency....Not my idea of a &quot;needed&quot; class, more of a convienience class when there are not enough specialists around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It comes down to: Why take a druid in bear form when you could have a warrior? Why take a druid in cat form when you could have a rogue? Why take a druid in normal form when you could have a priest (and they can rez!)? It is these things that always keeps the &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot; way down on the list of desirability. WoW druid might be a fun class. It might even be powerful. But it won't matter. You're still a gimped version of everything, and people know that.

Check the druid forum on the WoW site. WoW has sometimes mentioned druids would get rez, but not atm. Apparently, some think it is because a druid in cat form can feign death (how long will THAT stay in the game).

<br />
Anyway, we will just have to wait and see what happens with &quot;end game&quot; type stuff and so far it doesn't seem to be as big of a deal to have the perfect group in WoW as it was in EQ, mostly IMO because you can get good exp solo, so people aren't as uptight about the perfect exp group.  And a druid on the horde side will be more needed as a tank IMO since the horde does not have paladins.  The other nice thing about the versatility is multiple/all druid groups can do a lot, one to tank, one to sneak, one to heal, one to nuke, etc. druids will definitely stack well in groups which is good.  I loved all druid groups in EQ, but they sounds even more fun in WoW!</div></div><hr />

If you can't cast in animal form(ala Neverwinter Nights' Druid class), well, then you're sort of a lame duck.<br />
But you can't because then the animal forms would become overpowered.  From my understanding, the druid gets many warrior abilities while in bear form and many rogue abilities while in cat form as well as some other hp/ac boosts.  To balance this, you can't cast spells or use any items.  If they let you cast while in these forms, then it would be nearly pointless to have rogues and warriors when you can have a near warrior/rogue that can cast druid spells.  They are looking at adding better regen for health at least and possibly mana while in these forms, since right now the bear form especially seems to not be something you can stay in for long because you can't eat/drink in that form and it does seem silly to change to bear, fight, change back to eat/drink, change to bear, etc.<br />
<br />
The concept of the forms is that it be something you use in proper situations to gain an edge, but give up your spells and items in return.  You won't be a &quot;lame duck&quot; in these forms, the idea is for them to be a viable choice in the right situation.  It isn't like an EQ wolf form, where it is a buff that also changes your appearance.</div></div><hr />

After years of Sony fumbling in the dark trying to make Druids an even remotely useful class to a raid (shocking as it sounds, best CR/FR buffs in the game weren't enough *smirk*) i'm reluctant to take a wait and see attitude on the subject this time around. The game is in beta, this is the time to make changes/suggestions. I say now is when we should be pushing for a defined raid role, not six months/a year/two years from now when the game has hit the shelves and changes come fewer and further between.<br />
<br />
As I think on it, it's sad how mistrusting and jaded i've become after years of EverQuest, it's unfortunate that WoW and Blizzard almost have to prove themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno, I had a hell of a lot of fun with my characters before I ever got to level 65.  In fact, in retrospect, I think it was the best part of the game.  I might just not play any more end games in MMOG's since by that time, all the fun gets sucked out of it by too much ambition and acquisitiveness and too much familiarity -- if its anything like EQ.  If it ever gets to that point again, I'll know I've exhausted the game and its time to find something new to do.</div></div><hr />

I'm playing it right now, and other people (not me) are discussing this very thing, having fun at low levels, no one whining about camps, kill stealing (it does happen, but its not a very big deal), the rush to get to the end game... ahhhh so refreshing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, one would be foolish to ignore history.  I know for a fact that a big reason many raiding druids dont put down their toons to play another more useful class is simply because of the huge sunk cost.  They've already put a ton of time and effort and gear and flags into the one toon, the prospect of doing it all again, especially given the high standards of raiding guilds and the INCREDIBLE time sink of flags, is daunting to say the least.  So given the choice of continuing to play a marginal class or quitting, many just quit.  (Hi Gates of Discord!)<br />
<br />
Given that lesson, we're quite justified in worrying about what sort of end game role any class is going to be looking at a few months down the road.  Getting onto the same treadmill again knowing that the same problems await is masochistic at best!</div></div><hr />

I want this to be the game I play for the next several years, that I get excited about, that I scour message boards for. As a result, i'm inclined to look towards the future a little, give some consideration to what shape the game will take beyond the XP grinding phase.<br />
<br />
I'll certainly enjoy that, but eventually I will hit the level cap and raiding content will be a consideration. After years of being the lame bachelor stuck bringing salad in a bag to the potluck, i'd like to have a real job this time around. *grin* Seems everybody has an opinion on what this role can be, i'm not particularly picky about which we get, just as long as we get something. (although I still advocate heals over time/group heals best suited to healing AE damage, seems an effective and important role we could fill without unbalancing our capabilities in XP groups or solo)<br />
<br />
<br />
A bit of a side note, but am I the only one finding it increasingly frustrating reading the Blizzard boards and seeing how little actual beta testing is going on? Seems like the vast majority of &quot;testers&quot; are just people who wanted to play the game free/early and have no real interest in testing, tuning, and providing feedback. This is a golden opportunity for people to shape the future of the game, it's sad to see so many people waste it.</div></div><hr />

I see a lot of &quot;2-3 druid groups with 1 or 2 other classes&quot;, I am sure most of this is because druids were the new class this last push. Once more people go back to playing warriors and rogues, you'll have a choice when forming your groups: a real tank, or a gimped one, a real rogue, or a gimped one, a real healer, or a gimped one (and one that can rez vs one that can't, which apparently is sooo very important in the instanced dungeons ala GoD).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I have to disagree here.  It depends on the timesink, but some of the early EQ ones were enjoyable.<br />
<br />
CR's are some of my fondest memories.  I'll accept that 99% of the player base hated them though since they werent part of the actual CR team so spent hours wishing they were watching anime with me.  But for me running a druid around in places they shouldnt be to do a CR was quite a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Downtime.  In a way, mana breaks were the original timesink in EQ.  We probably spent 15 minutes out of every hour at least doing nothing.  But those were such enjoyable times.  I met many people and talked a lot.  Even today my guild groups will often take 15-30 minutes every few hours just to talk.  It sometimes becomes difficult to have lengthy discussions on anything while fighting constantly.  Doable certainly, but just sitting and doing nothing is part of the nostalgia I'll always remember about early EQ.<br />
<br />
Now the pointless timesinks are a different story.  The timesinks that are designed simply and solely to limit the number of items coming into the game are sick.  Many remember the days when the druid epic was one of the hardest to get all because waiting and killing Fay was such an issue.  Those are the camp timesinks that need to be gotten rid of.<br />
<br />
But there are many other time sinks that can be enjoyable if your willing to see past the min/max xp equation.<br />
<br />
I personally wont mind some timesinks in WoW.  Especially in the realm of grouping.  But I agree they so need to get rid of the pointless camp for X weeks ones.  And it sounds like they're doing a good job of that.</div></div><hr />

Errrm, Aly, that's pretty drastic. So, you believe most if not all tradeskillers are stupid. You believe most if not all questers are stupid. You believe all guilds who farm, for example, EP, are stupid. You believe XPing is stupid (really, they may not be green mobs, but honestly, they may as well be).<br />
<br />
I'm left to wonder if you believe playing EQ is stupid, period. <br />
<br />
My vision is quite different. Everything in EQ is repetitive, with some interesting twists here and there. Eventually, even raiding feels that way. I could go solo mobs like Lodizal, or try my luck at some WW dragons, or whatever else for &quot;challenge&quot;, but what for? Just to say I have done it? Then when I have done it... what? however I look at it, I come up with the simple fact that EQ = kill mob, kill mob, kill mob. <br />
<br />
So, am I stupid because I enjoy EQ? I think not. Because what I enjoy goes beyond this mindless thing. I enjoy the peeps. I enjoy working towards a goal, then reaching it. Same as in RL. It's too bad you can't see it, but then again, you look just about ready to quit EQ if you havent done so already. Too bad though that you think it was a waste of time...<br />
<br />
Callahad<br />
<br />
P.S. I am looking closely at WoW. I have confidence in Blizzard putting out good games, so it's worth watching. For WoW druids, if they really have one of the most demanded buffs, they may just be considered a &quot; buff specialist&quot;, making the class desirable in groups... But I can see how someone would be skeptical about that. It really depends how it comes out. Guess we will wait and see!</div></div><hr />

The amount of time required for many quests is outrageously uncalled for in a game.  I felt like I was working a job or doing a chore, while attempting some quests.  I log on to EverQuest a couple times a week as time permits.  I will never see the whole game at this rate and I love exploring.  I have been considering quitting EQ after coming back to it though.  I do not pay my $9.95 a month to do weekly chores in a virtual world and I can not justify paying that much for what amounts to a chat room.

I will most likely embrace WoW no matter what (unless it's horrendous, but come on, it's blizzard!)<br />
<br />
As far as CoH is concerned, it's great fun, but for me it's not deep enough for long term, it's an interim game while i wait for the WoW release or public beta.</div></div><hr />

The game is in beta, this is the time to make changes/suggestions. I say now is when we should be pushing for a defined raid role, not six months/a year/two years from now when the game has hit the shelves and changes come fewer and further between.<br />
I understand what you are saying, but the thing is, the endgame is not in beta yet :) It is good to give them feedback saying we want every class to be important to the endgame, but beyond that there isn't much to discuss right now.  The endgame is also my biggest concern right now, but no one knows what it will be, so that is why I am taking a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude for now.  I am hopeful because they are trying to make all classes desirable for groups now and I hope they will carry this to whatever the endgame ends up being.  I also believe they are very aware of the typical problems with hybrid-type classes and grouping/endgame, the Blizzard devs are rabid gamers too, though it doesn't hurt to bring it up.<br />

Sounds to me everyone thinks WOW is going to be and should be Everquest 2 (yes, I realise the title is taken).<br />
<br />
I have found a MMOG that does not follow the EQ pattern of required grind-&gt;raid level endgame. Collect loot along the way.<br />
<br />
I, and many others find it fun. Therefore, one can conclude that not all MMOGs must follow the EQ pattern.<br />
As for this, I know what I want from WoW, a game that will be my replacement for EQ.  And no, it doesn't have to follow the same path as EQ, however it does need to have an &quot;endgame&quot; for me to play and by that I mean something to do once your character is max-level.  It doesn't have to be EQ-like raids, but there has to be something there, and I know that I am not the only one who feels this way.<br />
<br />
Out of curiousity, which MMO are you refering to?  I am always looking for something to play now that I have canceled my EQ accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am more referring to the fact that you have to grind as fast as possible to the top level before you can really play the game.  Even original EQ wasn't like that.  I think that's a lot of the reason so many classes are &quot;out of place&quot; in the &quot;end game&quot;.<br />
<br />
I play Horizons.  One of the major complaints about it is there is not enough to do at a high level.  I am not up to that point yet and the game doesn't pressure a player to get there fast.  The end-game I suppose is the weekly events which you can participate in at any level.  I would guess that, perhaps one day,  it will involve much wrestling with the withered aegis which has taken over so much of the world.<br />
<br />
I would say that if your heavily into raids you may not like Horizons.  Then again, I enjoyed the raids in EQ, but when it came to the point I could no longer go to any for various reasons there was no longer a game.<br />
<br />
In Horizons I can still do things if I have 6 people with me or none.  I can do things with 20 or 4.  I am not tied to the treadmill or have to be in a guild of the elite just to get a chance to see new content.  Me and my friends can get by with our skill rather than a happenstance of our work schedule or the timezone we live in.<br />
<br />
It is my belief that the MMOG market today is a player's market.  You can choose the type of MMOG that fits the kind of game you want to play.  People who do want to play a MMOG and find that match, seem to be much happier players.</div></div><hr />

Agreed that we have no idea how the &quot;endgame&quot; is going to shape up, i'm sure they won't start testing that until towards the very end of the beta, if at all before the release version comes out. That said, the roles being defined for classes at lower levels are likely to carry on into the endgame. Right now it appears that Druids have no primary role. I understand the whole jack of all trades, master of none bit, but in a raiding setting that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
It's possible the spells involved haven't been introduced yet (perhaps debuffs? or as i've often stated i'm hoping for, group heals? neither of which are particularly useful at lower levels) but if that's the case, now is the time to be brainstorming on the boards. :) I'd rather see threads like the fifty page EQ ones &quot;what should our role on raids be?&quot; posted now, when the devs are still designing the endgame class roles, than 6-8 months from now when the game is on the shelves and it's too late.<br />
<br />
I think right now we're at a point where the developers are open to feedback, the community has a rare opportunity to tell the devs what we want to see as the future of the class. Obviously ridiculous requests will be ignored (&quot;We want the best heals, castable in cat form, while meleeing, and the best nukes... oh... we want SoW and Ensnare from that other game too&quot;) but in general at least from my perspective many of the threads on this board in particular have been very reasonable in their requests.<br />
<br />
That said, a post from Kat saying &quot;We won't ignore you guys like Sony did, trust us.&quot; would be more than enough for me. :) So far Blizzard's reputation is excellent, i'm sure they won't disappoint.</div></div><hr />
