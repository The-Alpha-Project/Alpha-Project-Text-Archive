I mean... beta usually means the core stuff is done and its balance time... <br />

If druids don't get their several months of pre-release nerfings, I don't know what I'll do!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And i'm not overly worried about the druid class not being in a push yet, apparently it's been tested thoroughly by blizz staff... <br />
<br />
i'm more eager to see how everything is done with the druids</div></div><hr />

I would be if that was all I knew about druids in WoW, but after reading posts of people talking about how finished the game is, my take is that druids and hunters are pretty finished internally, just not polished/balanced enough for beta.  Just my impression, if they would send that beta e-mail to me already I could know for sure :)<br />
<br />
Also, we all know how long Blizzard will take to make their games &quot;perfect&quot; and I am sure it will be the same for this one.  If they need to delay release (not that there is a release date yet anyway) to finish balancing, they will I am sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, I was pre-occupied with real-life stuff at the time the WoW sign-ups occured, so I wasn't bothered with trolling the websites of various up-and-coming games at the time.  This cause me to not here about the sign-up until it was a week too late :(<br />
<br />
Oh well...I'll keep an eye on the WoW community boards, and use the information that is posted there during beta to decide what I want to do once the game is released :)</div></div><hr />

So if you have not gotten an e-mail, you will unlikely get in before the 3rd phase.</div></div><hr />

Interesting. How do you know this and do you know when phase 3 is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the first time in my gaming life i'd actually pay to be in this beta.  The last time I was this excited about a game was SWG and that turned out VERY sour so here's to hoping for a better outcome with WoW.</div></div><hr />

Getting to time killed my guild (they still exist but in a sad sad state.)  Looking at GoD I just don't see it.  <br />
<br />
WoW looks pretty nice, having tigole on the WoW team makes me happier too.  Most of all the &quot;review&quot; at penny arcade Link (http://http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2004-03-22), and in particular the idea of a game that doesnt abuse its players gratutiously is really starting to appeal to me.<br />
<br />
Until then I decided $19.00  was the right price point to try a diablo type game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lowger</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait, they're going to charge $19 US per month?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wheew, thanks DM.  I'm hoping for a reasonable monthly fee and have heard $20-$30 dollars from a friend, who was only guessing, but then I see this $19 phrased in the way it was and got all spooked about montly fees again.<br />
<br />
$15 would be more than I want to pay but reasonable i feel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see them starting at $15, and moving up a few dollars as the years go on. $15 is a bargain for the hours of enjoyment most users will get out of the game per month.</div></div><hr />
