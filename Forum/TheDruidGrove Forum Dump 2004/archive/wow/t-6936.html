The site looks a little fresh, but I'm sure more will be added/fixed once they get fully up and running. Look forward to seeing more of these guys soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I.      You have to be online atleast 4 times a week.<br />
Sounds reasonable<br />
<br />
II.     Mail us if you are traveling.<br />
Also, reasonable<br />
<br />
III.    'l33t sp34k' is allowed, but not approved<br />
bothersome, honestly, i don't want to be in a guild where leet is even considered (call me picky but hey, i have to spend time with these people)<br />
<br />
IV.    The Kings (Leaders) are always right.<br />
Uh oh, as if that doesn't set off alarm bells!  Totalitarian rule is NEVER good, sure you can't have everything open for debate, and you can't please everyone, but to spell it out like this?  Almost sounds like someone's planning a little power-trip.<br />
<br />
V.      If you don't follow the rules you will be kicked out of the clan.<br />
Also fairly reasonable, though usually some sort of trial or hearing would be better.<br />
<br />
VI.     You have to be a druid to join this clan.<br />
YAY!</div></div><hr />

Imagine a guild in EQ that was only one class...then imagine it trying to do even the easiest of raid mobs at the appropriate level.  Say Naggy.  Now imagine the horrible horrible mess that would ensue.<br />
<br />
Ugly man.  Just Ugly.<br />

As for the other comments quoted from their page...Uber guilds aren't formed by having &quot;elitist&quot; ideas on your pre-beta guildpage.  They are formed by kicking ass in game.</div></div><hr />

Not that I disagree here Aidon...but I feel like playing a devil's advocate here.<br />
<br />
Assuming we take Blizzard at face value, the druid class in WoW is supposed to be one of the most versatile classes ever proposed.  If, as some people have suggested, it even becomes possible for druids to specialize in certain skill trees to say be more tank than caster or vice versa, then the possiblity of an all druid guild that is capable of doing a lot might become viable.<br />
<br />
Granted, it wouldnt be as efficent, nor would it be as easy, but it might be possible.<br />
<br />
Obviously an all druid guild would not work in EQ.  But how about an all paladin group?  I'm willing to bet they could do Naggy or Vox if twinked and buffed correctly.<br />
<br />
Personally though, I do think that any game that is capable of supporting a single class guild that is capable of doing high end content is doomed.  If that happens it will simply be proof positive that the class structure in that game is totally messed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have played with SG in many games, and it's a great guild.  Sorry if I don't under stand why a little over 1 dollar a month for acess to a guild in many games, and a large TS Server is bad.  It would cost way too much for the admin to pay it all themselves.  And no offense, but how are they noobs if they are going to be all dwarfs?  Maybe they plan on RP'ing a Dwarf City or something, but they definately don't desrve to be called noobs.  They are a good group.</div></div><hr />

As for Druid only Guilds.. its an idea.. but pretty darn boring imo .. you need variety.  Good Luck to them.. that link broken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeSoft</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a one-class guild is a bad idea, much worse than a one-race guild.<br />
<br />
as for 'Must be online four times a week' ... that alone would kill it for me right there.<br />
<br />
When the game is new, I'm liable to be online that much anyway, or more probably 5-6 times a week.<br />
<br />
However, a couple months after I start a game I tend to become very casual indeed, playing 1-2 times a week...or sometimes none times a week.<br />
<br />
MMOGS really aren't for me.  I have a life.</div></div><hr />

I bet necros could do it...sick damage, heals, FD, summon corpse, rez...<br />
<br />
<br />
I always thought a single race guild would be kinda cool, but I agree, variety is the spice of life. I would miss rp'ing the wispy wood elf druid chick to the big, lumbering ogre warrior...and I think the same would go for WoW. Besides, at a base level, I'd get bored of seeing only the same graphics. Amazing game, full of amazing graphics and I only get to see a few? Bleh...<br />
<br />
Let the oober gamers have their fun...as long as they're not disturbing my play time and game, I don't give a rats what they do. Knock yourselves out, boys, er, boyz...</div></div><hr />
