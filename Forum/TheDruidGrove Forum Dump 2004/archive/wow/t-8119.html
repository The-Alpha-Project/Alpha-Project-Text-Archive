<br />
Time to pick a main character.   So, what's it going to be?<br />
<br />
As for me... I still can't decide  :confused: <br />
<br />
I have played every race but troll, and every class except warrior to at least level 10, most to level 20.  Far enough to know if I like playing the class, but not far enough to spoil the class for me.  So far, I have it narrowed down to the following:<br />
<br />
Human Warlock (tailor/enchanter)<br />
Orc Shaman (skinning/leatherworking)<br />
Undead Rogue (herbalism/alchemy)<br />
Tauren Druid<br />
Night Elf Hunter<br />
Dwarf Paladin (mining/blacksmithing)<br />
<br />
I simply can't decide on which to create first :)<br />
<br />
I'll probably end up playing them all eventually, so I'll most likely create them in the order listed above to reserve the names, then play each one a bit until one grows on me.<br />
<br />
I love this... but I hate it too.  At least Blizzard is giving us 50 character slots across all servers with a max of 10 on a server so we can be choosy  :thumbup: <br />
<br />
Now... do I PvP or not?   :lol:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not had the same amount of time in WoW, as I did in EQ2, so I will not write a review.<br />
<br />
But..I will say I have had a blast and the WORST part is deciding which to play first.<br />
<br />
I made my decision:<br />
<br />
Nightelf Druid - herbalism, alchemy<br />
Gnome Sorcerer - tailor, enchanter<br />
<br />
Later:<br />
<br />
Human Warlock <br />
Night Elf hunter</div></div><hr />

Still not sure what I'm going to play, but it will likely be a Undead Priest or Rogue.. probably tailoring/enchanting, though if rogue, possibly herbalism/alchemy.<br />
<br />
And well I enjoy PvP, I'm not going to play on a PvP server. As WoW just isn't currently designed to be an enjoyable PvP game.</div></div><hr />

The Mage was INSANE; made the entire dungeon a completely different experience.  So now I'm torn between Druid and Mage.  Will likely still stick with Druid since I so love the versatility and ability to take a hit (even if not as well as a tank class).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I keep saying, I will NEVER play a Cleric / Priest class in another Online Game again.  I don't care how different they are from the EQ ones I just won't do it again.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to playing a Mage.  Got one up to level 12 during the Beta and was absolutely fun to play.  It just felt right.</div></div><hr />

Alts, I dunno yet.  I don't anticipate having time for an alt for a few months</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still leaning towards the warlock (dunno race yet, Alliance so I guess Gnome/Human) at the moment, Big Blue was just a fun pet, and plus, having an infernal just sounds like too much fun.  I didn't mind the druid, but honestly I'd have to have friends I was playing with constantly to play the druid - the warlock was much more fun solo than the druid.</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine wants to play a Shaman, so I'm limited to Tor DRU.<br />
<br />
I have no plans atm to do much more than casual raiding, so I'll have plenty of time for alts.  NE Rogue, Hunter.  Maybe a blaster caster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going Tauren Druid.  I've waffled quite a bit between druid and shaman (and even considered priest), but I think I'm settled on the Druid.  I know of the problems, but I feel the class is still fun, at least in principle.  It would be easy to choose the Shaman, but I'm forcing myself not to base my decision on the flavor of the month.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NE Rogue, hadn't decided on profession yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karisun</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I'm playing Horde side.  The races are a collection of misunderstood misfits and outcasts, which kind of fits in with how I feel about myself sometimes. :devil: <br />
<br />
So, I know that I will make a tauren druid, but I still don't know if it will really be my main or not.  I also plan to make an orcish warrior and rogue, and a hunter of undetermined race (probably Tauren, but we'll see).<br />
<br />
I think I'll make all four at the start to reserve my names, and decide from there.<br />

<br />
I'll be playing NE priest (tailoring/enchanting) and a NE druid (skinning/leatherworking). I'm sure I'll play with other classes over time, as well, like the rogue or hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serendip</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am leaning toward Tauren Druid - with an undead warlock or mage alt.  Definately all Horde though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BGrifter</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely a Troll Rogue after open beta, with a NE Druid alt. Original intent was to make the Druid the main, but like most of the ex-EQ players i'm taking a wait and see approach.<br />
<br />
Of course my real &quot;main&quot; will continue to be Saga of Ryzom *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faedia</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In open beta, I played a human paladin, human rogue, and a night elf hunter + druid.<br />
<br />
For retail I'll definitely have both a NE Hunter (w/ Alchemy and Herbalism) and a NE Druid (Trades not decided) - but I'm not sure which will evolve to be my &quot;main.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd advise going mining/engineering and picking up guns on a hunter. If the aesthics of the guns really bug you, and you'd rather stick bow, I can definently understand. Guns just have a very large stastical advantage over bows. Engineering can craft good DPS guns, as well as allow you to make ammo on the fly (which is higher DPS than any store bought). So you have an easier time getting weapons, ammo, and do more DPS. Though a blue bow will still out damage a green gun, given equalish levels, but that's to be expected =-p<br />
<br />
Also with making your own ammo, you can carry however many stacks in your ammo pouch (8-16), and then carry 20 bars and blasting powder on you = another 4000 ammo in two slots.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about with a hunter, if you haven't already =-)</div></div><hr />
