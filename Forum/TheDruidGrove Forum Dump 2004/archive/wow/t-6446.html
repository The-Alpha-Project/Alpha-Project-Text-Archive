/scratches head<br />
So, does that mean if my husband and I both apply for the beta, we'll be disqualified because we live together?   A bit counter productive there -- we game together, so we'll both want to beta the same games whenever possible.  And we're both well qualified to do so.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why this was put into place.  It was actually of benefit in the other games we have been in beta for to be able to join forces and test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because they don't want people applying for multiple beta accounts for their &quot;household&quot; and then giving them away to people who didn't make it, or worse, selling the accounts.</div></div><hr />

THAT is what they are trying to prevent.<br />

Abdico Mortis is the name of that guild. Lewzers...</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft Beta Test Signups Update<br />
Due to the great number of enthusiastic World of Warcraft fans, you may for a short time experience trouble signing up for the Beta. But please do not panic, for we are not picking Beta Testers by when they have signed up. As long as you sign up by February 4th, you have the same chance of being selected as if you had signed up this evening. <br />
<br />
We appreciate your patience, and look forward to receiving your sign up! <br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Beta Test Signups<br />
The online signup pages for the World of Warcraft Beta Test are now live! Anytime between now and 6:00 pm PST on Wednesday, February 4th, residents of Canada, Korea, and the US can submit their applications for a chance to help test one of the most anticipated massively multiplayer online role-playing games of 2004. Applicants in Korea should sign up at http://www.blizzard.co.kr. <br />
<br />
Testers will NOT be selected on a first-come, first-served basis; all applicants will receive equal consideration regardless of when during the signup period their application was submitted. Take time when completing the online forms, and double-check that all the information is correct. We won’t be able to update your application after you submit it, and multiple entries from the same household will result in complete disqualification. <br />
<br />
Please do not contact us regarding the status of your application. The beta test will occur in multiple phases; testers selected for the first phase will receive an email within the next several weeks. Those not selected for the first phase might still get in in a later phase. Be sure to check your email regularly during the beta test. <br />
<br />
Applicants in Canada and the US should click the link below to read the registration information and proceed to the signup pages. To ensure an optimal experience, the beta test for Europe and other countries around the world will take place later this year.</div></div><hr />

I was able to get in but they want to upload iinformation about my PC, and this PC is vastly underpowered compared to my gaming system at home. Guess I'll have to try again from home tonight.</div></div><hr />
