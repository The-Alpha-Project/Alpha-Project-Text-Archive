<br />
So my question on this one is do they have to stay immobile to stay in stealth mode? Thats how it worked in WC3. Either way still very cool.<br />
<br />
Over all I think they did a great job with the traits.</div></div><hr />

It would be a bit overpowering if they were allowed to move. Kind of makes the Rogue's abilities useless if that was the case.<br />

The wisp thing is interesting. I may have to kill Rahj's druid just so I can take a peek at that!</div></div><hr />

One of the things in game that is a lot of fun is finding the treasure chests and I just think everyone should have the same chance at them.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to trying the wisp trait out.</div></div><hr />
