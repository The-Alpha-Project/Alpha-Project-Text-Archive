Players have the ability to attack almost all opposing faction NPCs including vendors and quest givers. If a player attacks an opposing faction NPC, players of the opposite faction are then able to target and attack that player. Whenever an NPC is attacked, players who share the same faction as that NPC will receive a system message indicating that a specific town is under attack.<br />
<br />
I like this idea, though it does give me some cause for concern, I can see raids forming just to take out the opposing factions busiest and important quest NPC's, this is going to be revised a lot i imagine.<br />

On the Horde vs. Alliance race war server, territories will be indicated whenever a player enters a new zone. The zone name will now include additional information to inform the player of the territories status. Additionally, the mini-map will be color coded to indicate who controls the zone: <br />
<br />
Green = Friendly<br />
Red = Enemy<br />
Yellow = Contested<br />
<br />
<br />
Contested zone's eh?  Sounds like there could be actual movement of the front lines :D<br />
<br />
Postal System (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/mail.shtml)<br />
Mail can be sent to players by NPCs. Players on ignore lists will not be able to send mail to those ignoring them. <br />
Hrm... quest-o-gram anyone?  I like the fact that they've included NPC's as a dynamic that can send mail, makes the world a little bit more realistic, it's also nice that they've taken the Ignore list seriously and carried it over everywhere... In CoH if you put someone on your ignore list all they have to do is add you to their friends list and talk to the friends channel to bother you...</div></div><hr />
