<br />
They are going to have to do some major retuning for this...and I fear for Druids next patch.  Its unlikely any druid changes will make it in this coming patch...and that means Druids having to do the same jobs with already weak spells and now, no way to regain mana during combat short of potions or the abysmally weak Paladin aura. <br />
<br />
Weep all ye Druids and pray the patch after this does some major revamps.</div></div><hr />

They'll need feedback from magic users and the stats they generate to see how to tweak what.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People really need to break out of their EQ mindsets. There is no benefit to sitting, other than some minor health regeneration. If you are out of mana and can't drink, then contribute to the fight with wands or melee.<br />
<br />
An MMOG where casters don't have to sit around half the fight, or get griped out when they melee, sounds pretty fun.</div></div><hr />

I for one, am not enjoying the &quot;revised&quot; encounters of old coupled with inability to drink.  I've spent my entire stash of Greater Mana Potions and started using my Noggenfoggers.  I don't care so much the &quot;sit &amp; med&quot; inbetween the fights, but for &quot;elite&quot; encounters it's just ridiculous.  Not to mention, with the &quot;secret&quot; aggro change, you get a lot of aggro from healing.  It doesn't help that Taunt (including Improved Taunt max specd) aren't very effective.<br />
<br />
Recall Tremors of Earth with the 2 dragons?  I tried to do that with a group today and we were bloody spanked.  We had a Mage using Arcane, Paladin who healed Warrior before me - Druid, and a Rogue.  Needless to say, I was pulling my hair out after our second wipe.  I have a feeling everyone will have to be 50 or higher to complete this quest as with Eranikus and Stones that Bind Us (Don't you love the changes to our rewards?).<br />

Sure that might be great if resists worked properly (i.e. not based on level, but actual # resist) but it's a hard knock.  What's more upsetting is I wish I had done Tremors of Earth pre-patch and banked the quest so I can get that uber necklace.  Looks like I will have to wait until we're all 55 because I got SPANKED tonight with single pulls.  Paladin and I were OOM before we could get one of the drakes to 99.95% hp.  No way can this be done at 50 without like 2 Pri/Dru, 1 War, 1-2 Mage and or 1 Paladin. :curse:</div></div><hr />

I not been to the Temple post-patch and only set foot in BRD twice.<br />
<br />
Twice having done Golem Lord, we usually kill one golem, die + priest leash &amp; return to red, kill second golem, repeat, kill GL and go on our merry way.  The two trios of Fire Elementals before the bar are always a kicker!!!  Hrm.. what else?  I have once been able to reach the Ghost Ring and we wiped with 3 ghosts remaining.  Never able to recover after that.  My husband said his mage friend can sometimes get in a few drinks between the ghosts if he spam clicks on the drinks and they kill fast enough (usually have 2 at a time and not more).  I have yet to try what the mage does...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we've adapted pretty well.  The ghost ring isn't very difficult if you have a priest with you who can shackle.<br />
<br />
The hardest room, so far, is the bloody lyceam, but drinking wouldn't help there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jenalyn</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first trip to BRD was with a jerk Paladin [55], Mage [54], Priest [53], Warrior [54], and me [53].  We got stuck in the Bar because the Paladin triggered the guards and Phalanx to the door.  We wiped trying to take the elemental, 3 officers and Phalanx together and were quickly defeated.  So that's basically how far I got with my first group.  We did happen to kill one named boss despite our corpse runs and such.  Golem Lord...  Oh how I hate this bugger!  We died on the first go only to return and plunge to our deaths after each kill. While effective I don't think it was effecient or fun to say the least.<br />
<br />
My second trip to BRd was with a nice Mage [55] I have bummed water from almost daily for a week and the additional members were Priest [55], Warrior [55] and Rogue [53].  We skipped the General and used a similiar approach with GL except that we had the Priest hang out at a safe distance to res us after we made each kill.  A good moment for me during this episode was the fact we killed the /red/ Golem and got GL down to half before the last of us 4 ate it.  How effectively can you clear all 3 mobs without having to do a CR/Res and not drink inbetween?<br />
The only real challenge after GL was the Ghost Ring.  Hurley, Ribbly and Phalanx seemed nothing more than a random cluster of trash.  We triggered the encounter and started beating down one ghost.  I remained in normal form the whole time having to spot heal for the Priest.  We eventually ran out of mana by the 3rd ghost and somehow killed another one with the aide of potions.  We tried to recover to no avail.  I have to agree it's a little easier with shackle, but we seemed slow.  Next time I go I will probably do cat form...<br />
As far as I have heard, Lyceam goes a bit better with 2 AEers.<br />
<br />
Why did I just rehash myself with more words? No idea =\  I gotta stop for the night... Getting a cold from your 2yro sucks :P<br />
<br />
*new addition*<br />
Well, since my 2yro won't go back to bed... I figure I'll try to toss in a few more things.  We somehow managed to do Tremors of Earth with me, Rogue [55] and 3 others under 50.  Iirc, they were Paladin [43], Mage [46], and Priest [48].  Man, that was amazingly different from my prior attempt post-patch to get these buggers.  I don't know what to say but it went smoothly that we only had to drink between the 2 drakes.<br />
I definitely don't think we ever have to worry about not being able to drink/eat while engaged with regular encounters (outside of instances).  In a way, I am starting to enjoy the change because it allows things to be a bit more difficult.  Seeing how some groups of 5 have blown through Ghost with the change shows that it just takes a group who are on top of things and balanced (War, Priest, Mage and &quot;whatever&quot;).<br />
<br />
Ok... back to seeking Sudafed and such. How the heck do you get a cold in Texas during the Summer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the best way to get through the ghosts is to have the druid go cat form..and go all out on the ghosts, until you get to Vile'rel.  Shackle him, then wait for Doom to come out...kill Doom, kill his pets, then kill Vile.  Obtain your loot.<br />
<br />
The lack of drinking...in retrospect, was a good thing.<br />
<br />
But they need to fix spirit.  I'm not sure how groups are going to finish the Princess quest now that she isn't fearable w/o spirit working.  Well I have an idea or two.  We'll test em out tomorrow most likely.</div></div><hr />
