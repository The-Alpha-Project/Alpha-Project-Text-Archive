<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaragone</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a concern about WoW and I am not sure how best to express it. I have been playing EQ for 4+ years and been in the same guild with the same people for 90% of that time. I have left EQ one time for a short stint in Horizons. I left Horizons because there was nothing to do except be a crafter and so I went back to EQ. <br />
<br />
So here is my concern: will there be any reason for grouping/community? I have pretty much kept up on the major sites for WoW and it looks like a pretty game but is there going to be anything beyond personal quests? Are there going to be tough monsters for a group to come together and kill to get some magnificent reward? Now I am not much of a raider, my playtime is pretty limited due to RL issues but I enjoy grouping and EQ basically enforces that with the mob difficulty. I have seen on most of the WoW sites that the mobs are not that tough and most chars can solo well. If this is the case what is the point of it being an online game? If I wanted to play by myself all the time I could go and get one of thousands of single player games and I wouldn't have to pay a monthly fee. So for all you better-informed people out there please answer my question. Is WoW going to be a grouping-community based game or is it gonna be a endless stream of quests that I personally get and complete for the betterment of my character? <br />

Grouping allows one to take on more difficult quests, completing them quicker and earlier than would be possible solo.<br />
<br />
WoW is more group-friendly than EQ when it comes to quest drops.  Often, spontaneous groups will form at quest locations, since everyone in a group with a given quest will get the quest drop when the mob dies.</div></div><hr />
