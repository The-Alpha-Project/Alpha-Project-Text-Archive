It's going faster. How can i be sure I'm in? or will be able to play once my client is done downloading tomorrow? Thanks for any replies.</div></div><hr />

When I was on the WoW website starting my account, it had an account key there I had to put in, before selecting my username and password. Is that the key you are talking about?</div></div><hr />

That the only time you should ever be asked for your key by anyone.</div></div><hr />

If you have an account name and password, you don't need the key any more</div></div><hr />

If you created your account directly on the WoW site rather than through File Planet you will not recieve an email nor need to use the account key later on.  The account creation page has a general account key and verification process and once you have completed all steps of the process and gotten to the download page you are set. It won't matter where you actually download the client as long as you recieved the account created confirmation on the blizzard site.</div></div><hr />
