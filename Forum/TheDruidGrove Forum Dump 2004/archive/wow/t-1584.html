WoW looks better all the time.  I think EQ/EQ2 will have some stiff competition on its hands :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WyteNK</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, basically, WoW will do away with:<br />
- Timesinks in general<br />
- XP grinds<br />
- Starting character stat/deity screwups<br />
- Rare spawn camping<br />
- Raid level mob camping / botching<br />
- Holy Trinity<br />
- Death XP loss<br />
- Corpse retrieval<br />
- Overcrowding of adventure areas<br />
- Ambiguous Quests<br />
<br />
Sounds like everything I dislike/hate about EQ is going to be addressed.  Coupled with an optimized 3D engine, and the fact that it is 100% WARCRAFT!!,  looks like a winner to me.<br />
<br />
Competition is good for the fans as well;  who knows if LDoN would'a happened without competition like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to be a pessimist, but haven't we said nearly the same thing with both DAoC, Shadowbane and SWG came out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the only game I thought could give EQ a real run for its money before release was DAoC.  And it did a fair job of denting EQ's hold on the market.  Unfortunately, their high end game was lacking for a while, so people came back to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DigginsEQ</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From scan #10:<br />
<br />
&quot;DRUIDS:  The jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow!  That's a new concept! :lol: <br />
<br />
The shapeshifting ability looks cool but I can just imagine the horde of Night Elf druids that will be running around when WoW is released.<br />
<br />
From scan #9:<br />
<br />
&quot;Furthermore, while there are plenty of tough monsters in the outside areas, none will yield any of the kind of unique &quot;phat lewt&quot; for which other players will want to camp or steal or grief other players&quot;<br />
<br />
They might want to rethink that strategy.  Otherwise, all those outdoor zones will be lifeless graveyards like most of the EQ outdoor zones outside of PoP.  Players go where the best loot and exp rewards are.  Period.<br />
<br />
I'm skeptical of all the fanboism running rampant over this game atm and that article has fanboy written all over it.  However, WoW does seem to have that rare &quot;buzz&quot; that the original EQ and UO had prior to their release and they proved to be very successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey... an ingame email system! <br />
<br />
Oooh... I like their idea of combining EQ's cleric and Enchanter.  The idea the priest is an inquisitor is kind of cool more interesting than being a walking medicine cabinent. :)  <br />
<br />
Ok, this sounds amazing.  Like they said in the first scan, they were pretty skeptical and didn't really want to review it, but they had to be pried away from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DigginsEQ</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought you scratched this game off your list Panamah :p <br />
<br />
What do you think of the Wow rogues being that you are one in EQ?  From the description, it sounds to me like another backstabbing machine instead of really roguish.  It's also kind of odd considering there isn't a rogue class in the Warcraft series that I remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I wasn't too impressed by rogues being backstabbing machines except it sounds like disguises and opening chests, picking locks, might have more significance in WoW than EQ.  Maybe poisons too.  I dunno, I think they need to really give rogues some things to do that'll make them feel like rogues!  EQ never has done that well at all I think because the environment is so static.  But if you can interact a lot more with NPC's and objects, then a rogue might become a really fun class to play.<br />
<br />
I'm also concerned that the whole guild thing is going to be reenacted in Wow.  I'm not a fan of the big guild experience in general.  However, it does sound like the questing mechanism is going to be really good.  <br />
<br />
One thing I heard about SWG is that the best stuff in the game is make through tradeskills.  I haven't heard anything about Tradeskills in WoW.<br />
<br />
But I am real impressed that they seem to have fewer classes.  I think that's one of EQ's downfalls.  Too many classes and groups being too small tends to get certain classes preferential treatment.<br />
<br />
I also liked what they said about the whole experience issue.  That you get involved in questing and you don't pay attention to your xp progress.  <br />
<br />
One thing, I bet WoW will precipitate a lot of changes in EQ, just like DAoC did.  :p  <br />
<br />
Another thing is that it sounds like you'll have to pick a race/faction all your friends are playing otherwise you won't be able to really interact with them much.  I can imagine that everyone is gonna want to play the good side.  Who wants to be a zombie?  If they made the undeads a little sexier, like Vampires, I could see it happening...<br />
<br />
The other thing I didn't like was the foot long ears on the elves and the headlights for eyes.  Gah!</div></div><hr />

SWG has that already. It's pretty nifty.</div></div><hr />

I think it already has... ala LDoN.</div></div><hr />
