Rob Pardo on Item Attribute Changes:<br />
<br />
Items have been modified so that certain stats are more commonly found on any given armor slot. For example, agility is now a common stat on leg armor while stamina is much rarer. Hopefully, this gives players more choices when deciding what stats they want to look for in certain slots instead of all warriors simply loading up on either strength or stamina gear in all of their armor slots. <br />
<br />
The numbers were increased in order to obtain a greater variance among items of different levels. Where before it was common to see belts from level 20-25 all have the same stats, now there will be more of a difference. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, items with random properties (i.e. “of Strength” items) that dropped before this push could not be changed and will be underpowered compared to items with the new stat numbers. Any items with random properties that drop in the new beta will have the updated stats. <br />
<br />
Rare items and better have been boosted relative to uncommon items. Previously, there wasn’t much of a difference between a rare item from an uncommon item that was a few levels higher. The change was made to accommodate the fact that rare items require more work to obtain and players should be rewarded for this. <br />
<br />
Interesting... very interesting, we need more...<br />
Addressing a players concerns:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Do you now recommend that we sell all our present gear (or let someone disenchant it) as it will never be fixed? <br />
<br />
<br />
It will never be &quot;fixed&quot;, so its up to you if you want to sell and start over or just replace slots as you find them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) You mention in another post that, to do Temple now, we will need to &quot;gear up&quot; with new stuff appropriate to our level. How are we supposed to &quot;gear up&quot; when we spent days/weeks acquiring last patch's gear (e.g. pure 'of agility' items), when it's even RARER now, according to what you just explained? Just curious what your recommendation is. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, this is unfortunate and in retrospect we probably should have just done an item wipe or a character wipe, since the current situation does not reflect how your character would feel had you levelled up from scratch under the new system. I've just been trying to avoid character and item wipes as much as possible since I know it is demoralizing to the beta testers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
why wasnt any of this in the patch notes? <br />
<br />
<br />
Because the designers responsible did not send in the information to the patch coordianting. I'm sorry about the lack of information, but with such a large team we do miss some things in the patch notes and try to get the information out to the forums when we do find them. <br />
<br />

On the topic of Grouping Philosophy Rob had this to say:<br />
<br />
This is mainly in regards to issues where people seem to not understand our dungeon and grouping philosophy... <br />
<br />
Dungeons WILL require a balanced group including a healer, tank, damage classes and likely some form of crowd control. <br />
<br />
Tank: Warrior, Paladin, Druid (bear form) <br />
Healer: Priest, Druid <br />
Secondary Healer: Shaman, Paladin <br />
Damage classes: Mage, Rogue, Hunter <br />
Crowd Control: Mage, Warlock <br />
<br />
I realize that there are imbalances between classes that are supposed to be filling the same roles right now (Paladins can't tank as well as Warriors), but our goal is to have each class do similar roles according to the above list but also play somewhat different. We could just give Paladin taunt and suddenly they would be golden, but we would rather work on other mechanics to make him a viable tank. Once we are done with the beta test, the above chart should be true. <br />
<br />
-Eno <br />
<br />
<br />
Then in the same thread in response to someone saying Temple was impossible:<br />
<br />
You can complete Temple this push. Unfortunately due to a variety of issues (mainly to due with items) most characters are currently underpowered. <br />
<br />
Once you re-gear up with gear appropriate to your class and learn how to conserve mana better (no spam casting of HW:Shield, etc) you will have no problems, but it will be more challenging. <br />
<br />
-Eno <br />
<br />
<br />
From here the thread meanders (as they all do) onto topics such as Class Roles:<br />
<br />
Ok - I'll spend a little more time commenting on this... <br />
<br />
First, yes we are designing classes with some plan to their role and with the explicit intention of forcing players to have a balanced TEAM to win versus encounters. Any class based team game does the exact same thing. If your argument is that you should be able to have any 5 characters to win, then you are looking for a game that is not based on classes. <br />
<br />
Secondly, we are trying very hard to give classes additional utility outside of their core GROUP roles. All classes can solo, many classes can help groups in ways outside these core roles, some classes can fill multiple roles depending on the situation. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, yes equipment is meant to be meaningful to your characters and the game. If gear isn't meaningful than what is the reason to put stats on it at all? <br />
<br />
Lastly, yes I know that not everything I have explaining is yet perfectly in the game, but it will be worked out before release. Whenever a lot of changes go into a patch it sometimes seems like monkeys may be at the controls, but with such a large development team, many features come online at different times. We do have things coming down the pipe and a plan to resolve the issues you have. <br />
<br />
ps- Shamans are not just meant as secondary healers, but more of a &quot;hybird&quot; class that is very desireable in group due to the different areas they can help with. They just are not meant to be better than a warrior at tanking or a priest at healing, etc. <br />
<br />
-Eno<br />
<br />
Of course from there it turns into another 4 pages of bickering about unfair sides (due to the development path as far as I'm concerned) unbalanced classes (this is why we're in Beta) ad nausiem...  The posts I go through for the sake of information gathering numb my brain.<br />
I thought Mr. Pardo handled himself admirably.<br />
