Perhaps Blizz is trying patching instead of content updating :p<br />
<br />
Some interesting things in the patch notes though:<br />
<br />
Travel Form is now only useable outdoors.<br />
Ugh, why... why??!?!?! what did we ever do to you?!?!<br />
<br />
Cower, Growl and Challenging Roar are now useable against targets that are immune to physical attacks.<br />
Not entirely sure where that comes in, but, um... YAY.... i think.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Spell: Hibernate (Level 18).<br />
More on this when i figure out what exactly it is/does.<br />
<br />
Shapeshifting now breaks roots, snares, and freeze effects.<br />
<br />
Looking through the notes, there seem to be a lot of things that now do exactly this, i'm glad we got one.<br />
<br />
All Shapeshift forms now include an immunity to polymorph effects.<br />
That one just makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
Bear Form - HP gain increased.<br />
<br />
Dire Bear Form - HP gain increased.<br />
That can only be good :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Puts a target to sleep for X seconds. Only one target can be forced to hibernate at a time. Only works on beasts and dragonkin.<br />

Pulled this from a random poster on the boards, so don't blame me if this is wrong.  :)  Interesting.  Druid CC for a couple creature types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">druids also apparently lost the self res talent? i dunno though, i haven't been able to get one and just when i did the server shut down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, self res, which wasn't that great, was replaced with a talent that is arguably even worse.  I'll refrain from comment in the hopes I am just not understanding how its supposed to work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea...I am wondering about that skill they replaced res with too...doesnt that great<br />
<br />
Maybe if it was 200% of your mana regen for 20 secs while casting...but just mana regen for 20 seconds doesnt sound that great.  Most fights i have seen dont last long enough for me to use all my mana, then wait 20 secs to regen more</div></div><hr />

<br />
Item Decay dosent seem to be that bad. Even after I had died several times I only had to pay a couple Silver to get my stuff fully repaired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cost isn't a huge deal, but its too much of a timesink at the moment.  Their stated goal is that you shouldn't have to repair more than once every day or two though, which should be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to carry around about 5 stacks of meat just to keep the little dude happy.</div></div><hr />
