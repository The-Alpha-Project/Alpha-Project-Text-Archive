I played EQ since late 1999.  I have a built in group of friends I play WoW with.  When they aren't on, I'll solo.  Hardcore.  Raiding is last on my list of to do's.  I love to quest.  I love to test the limits of the class.<br />
<br />
I wish this opinion was from the L60 viewpoint, but I've only played in the final stress.  I've tinkered with questing, trades and a few other classes.  Lots of fun.  I have a Druid up to L19 at the moment and here is my take.  If I've missed something, or have my facts wrong please jump in and let me know.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing shape shifting is a highly viable option.  I say this because others have said and I agree that shifting shapes doesn't work well in groups.  When soloing for XP I find myself moving in and out of bear form regularly and without any problem.  It's fun and the halmark of a WoW Druid.  Chain killing mobs is efficient and fun.  The WoW Druid with Bear form is an efficient killing machine, solo.  Then again, I hear all classes can solo efficiently.<br />
<br />
As I said from my personal experience, shape shifting in groups doesn't work well.  My DPS drags in Bear form because the mob is heavily damaged by the time it even arrives on pull then when it runs I have to chase it.  Why bother?  Just stay in regular form and nuke.  You can't cast any spells in bear form and if you change to Druid form to cast a spell then go back to Bear form all the rage you had banked up is gone.  For anyone that hasn't played beta, Rage is like mana for melee special moves only it starts out at zero and goes up as you attack mobs.  If you aren't in combat it quickly dissipates -- annoying.<br />
<br />
I don't have cat form yet - L20.  I wonder how that DPS compares.  I've only tinkered with combo points with a pure class Rogue, so we'll see.  Looks like fun but I wonder how diluted it is.<br />
<br />
Talents.  Pft, Talents!  If I'm going to be a grouping Druid why wouldn't I pick all of the healing talent options?  Healing in groups seems to be our first calling like it or not.  Am I wrong?  So -- it seems like suicide to pick all the cool Feral and Nuking balance options then to try and go into a group as a healer.  So, how do I really feel about talents?  If you do nothing but solo, you'll love it.  If you like to group you're going to be upset that you're picking all the healing talent options when you're rather be picking the others...unless you really like healing, then whey didn't you just make a Priest?<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
If you're a Druid (you Druids know what I mean), you're probability going to play a Druid in WoW.  That said, I know many of you other long-time Druids aren't willing to go through what we did in EQ.  You love the class flexibility even if you loath not being as powerful as the class you mimic.  Those of us that stay with a Druid are going to hope Blizzard fixes the class enough that the perception or reality of the class not being first choice group worthy goes away.  We'll see.<br />

I can tank or do DPS and when the main healer in the party (which I never am, always secondary healer at most, it's a rule since i'm feral specced) looks like they're struggling i quickly shift out, root whatever might be hitting me, toss a couple heals and shift again (sometimes i need to drink a pot to get enough mana to shift if my healing services are really needed).  Very rarely do i stay in druid form for the entire length of a battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a couple questions for you, if you don't mind.  You say you're feral specialized.  Are you main tanking?  How often?  What level are you now?  How viable is that option being that you are fully feral speced? -- as good as a warr/pally, nearly as good, good enough, needs some attention, just plain sucks.  If you're not main tanking is your feral spec for the fun factor or are you thinking it gives you certain advantages?  What are they?  Lastly, does the weapon you're holding have any affect on the damage you do while in your feral form?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuin</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can add my own thoughts to this thread, since I've been in beta since June (I think) and leveled up to 60 on the closed beta server.<br />
<br />
To add to your rage comments--rage is built up based on each time you get hit; the more you get hit, the faster it builds. Cat form abilities takes energy; when you shift, your bar isn't full, but it builds up pretty quickly. As you use an ability, it drops and then gradually builds again.<br />
<br />
DPS is great at lower levels with bear form, and goes up when you get cat form. If I dumped all my mana into a fight with nukes in caster form, then I could get up over bear form damage, but it never struck me as a very efficient means to play. You can deal great damage in forms while regenning mana, and pop out to help heal or whatever when/if needed. Meleeing in caster form with a DoT and regen on yourself is possible, but a bit slower than when shifted.<br />
<br />
Tanking--<br />
Yup, I've been the main tank several times, especially at lower levels (up to about level 40 or so). Around level 40 and higher, other classes get mail, and then plate armor, which will leave you taking hits from mobs harder than they will. In other words, you're no longer the best choice for a tank, and groups often prefer you as a healer for that reason. Perhaps this changes if you are fully feral-spec'd.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion--we need an AC/blocking ability boost, and it would be lovely if our weapon damage was used in forms (currently, it's not--your forms are set at a base damage rate, and so while other classes get upgrades in damage from their weapons as they acquire new items, we don't when in forms).<br />
<br />
Cat form is insanely fun, although I noticed that my damage started to drop off in comparison to caster damage as I leveled, so I rarely used cat form (unless I was scouting with Prowl). Regardless, you'll find that you can tear through mobs when you first get cat form and having a blast.<br />
<br />
I really hate to say this, but I'm having serious doubts that I will play a druid at retail. I don't mind healing (and only healing/buffing) on raids and instances, but I'm doing a better job of that with my priestess. Since that's all I'm wanted for (mostly) at level 60, I've set aside my druid now as an alt for when I want to play around on my own or with a friend.<br />
<br />
Just to reiterate--this is totally my opinion, and I'm sure there are druids out there that might disagree with me. The class is a ton of fun to play, so I'll definately have a druid alt...but since I only heal in druid at level 60, I've decided that the priestess fits better with my playstyle.</div></div><hr />

defense/stam gear for bear form<br />
agi/stam gear for cat form<br />
int/spirit gear for caster form<br />
<br />
and now you can't switch armor around in combat either, so you're less effective if you have to switch mid-combat.<br />
<br />
And cat form is about.. 40% of the DPS of an even equipped level 30 rogue.. it gets worse the higher you go.</div></div><hr />

Just a comment on Talents.  This seems to be what its like for a lot of classes.  As a priest for example, going straight shadow looks like it would be a hell of a lot of fun, but end game wise, I am obviously going to have to put a decent amount in holy to be truly effective.  <br />
<br />
One thing to bear in mind is the first respec of your talents only costs 1 gold, which, by level 60 won't be a huge deal for you.  So in my priest example, I could level up with shadow if I wanted to, and maybe switch over to a more group friendly spec in the 50-60 range.  Likewise with the druid, you could go feral until late game.</div></div><hr />

Play what you'll have fun with.  Don't play a class that you feel &quot;obligated&quot; to play.  And don't feel bad for not playing a Druid.<br />
<br />
In RPGs (D&amp;D and similar), I've always been the Cleric, Paladin or holy type.  After EQ, I will NEVER play a Priest in another online game again regardless of how different they really are from the EQ Cleric.  Going Human Mage for Retail myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that I never tried a druid in WoW, but I've partied with them, and read a lot about em.  Played one in EQ since that game was released, etc etc...<br />
<br />
Seems to me that the druid class in WoW is fated to be as useless in the end game as the EQ druid is.  The bottom line is...  if you make a class designed to fill 3 roles... then you have 3 other classes each with those roles but specialized in them... then you cant ever make the fleixble single class as good as the specialized class in that role.  Otherwise what would be the point of the other 3 classes?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that a multi-role class only shines when there are more roles needed than there are people available/allowed to fill those roles.  The druid worked reasonably well in EQ for that in many situations, to varying degrees throughout the life of EQ.  One reason for this is that the specialist classes really were very narrowly defined in EQ (until recently) so that the extra flexibility could be an asset - at least in single group situations.  In raids it simply doesnt have any value, because the specialist is always available to do the required job better.<br />
<br />
So in WoW, you've got the druid class, supposedly with these 3 roles.  They seem to work quite well for the first 20 levels... the next 20 are kinda iffy... and by the end, you are basically reduced to what an EQ druid is reduced to - a second rate healer with anemic dps and a buff that people like but can easily do without.  And unlike EQ, there's no grinding for AA's at the end of your level path (for good or bad), so the impetus for doing single group encounters is lessened in everyone who reaches max level.  The end game of WoW seems like it's going to revolve around raiding, and that means specialists are needed.  The WoW druid may fill a niche role in the WoW raiding game, yes, but will that be enough?  Or will there be more endless heartache about the loss of relative power that relying on class flexibility makes inevitable?<br />
<br />
The journey will no doubt be enjoyable... WoW is a heck of a lot of fun.  But what worries me about the druid class in WoW is the feeling that the time will be wasted in the end, that if I still want to play and be useful at level 60, however long it takes me to get there, that I would have been better off playing a different class, or that I'll again wind up fighting a never-ending battle for endgame relevance.<br />
<br />
I'll probably never play another game as much as I played EQ, so it's mostly academic to me really... but I do have to wonder whether it'll turn out the same way for the druid class.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, my huntress has even more issues than that, and I found her to be the most fun of the classes I did try hehe... so who knows, eh?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lark</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually have two mains in a game. <br />
<br />
1. That I play solo, when my friends and family are not on. (So I do not level ahead of them)<br />
<br />
2. That I play with my group, when they want to do something.<br />
<br />
I will be playing my druid as my solo main. They are wildly fun for solo play. They can go swimming around on the bottom of the sea finding treasure chests to open! <br />
<br />
I tend to roleplay and tradeskill more when I am out soloing. The druid is fun, because you have forms to roleplay with. <br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but I see two aspects of WOW from my short time in the game.<br />
<br />
1. The pre-60 pretty much solo game, where you level, get gear and work on trades.<br />
<br />
2. The 60 end game that is mostly for instancing and raids.<br />
<br />
I think the Druid will be most fun for the first part, and will satisfy my desire to get away from endgame content now and then ..and just go fish!</div></div><hr />

Oh you're dead on on that KB, I'm more than a little skittish about making a druid my main, but i'm in love with the class and determined that I'm going to play one (besides, i DO find them a lot of fun... hell just about anything in this game is fun).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danofthelake</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to make a comparison between warriors and druids with respect to tanking.  I've heard over and over that at high levels druids fall short of being a decent tank, but based on the skills and items available it seems to me that they should be at least close in abilities.  <br />
<br />
The first aspect of tanking that has gotten a lot of discussion is the armor (leather vs plate).  Now at first glance the leather armor seems WAY lower than plate, but if you apply the AC bonus of say Dire Bear (+125% according to thottbot) the difference becomes much more reasonable.  For example, I compared the normal plate armor to the reinforced leather armor, both level 45, both vendor purchasable.  Adding up the numbers for all the armor slots (no shield) yields 2662 for plate and 758 for leather (without any other bonuses).  Now if you modify the leather armor to reflect dire bear form you get 1705 armor, about 1k short of plate, but not really horrible.  Interestingly, if you add an armor kit to the four allowed pieces you get +160 armor (i think the best armor kit if 40 per piece).  I'm not positive if the bear form AC modify applies to these armor kits, since they show up in green on your char sheet, but if they do then that makes the final number 2822 for plate and 2065 for leather/bear.  That's less than 800 difference... which seems pretty good for leather.<br />
<br />
Now aside from the leather issue, there are the skills available to warriors and druids.  It seems to me, just from looking at skills lists, that I would actually prefer the bear skills over a warrior's... simply because a bear doesn't need to worry about stances.  From what I can tell a warror can't charge during combat unless they are in berserk stance and can't taunt unless in defensive stance, both of which a druid can do in bear form.  The warrior certainly gets more skills to use during melee, but I can't see myself using more than a handful during a fight... rage doesn't generate THAT fast and I would probably save it for stuns/interrupts and occasional mauls.  On top of that, the druid gets to pull with spells like wrath or, more idealy, moonfire.  At high levels moonfire is a much better DOT than the rend warrior ability and can be cast at range.  There's also MOTW, thorns, and the heals that can be used in a pinch...<br />
<br />
So after looking at all of the abilities/shortcomings of both warriors and feral druids I can't say as though a druid looks as bad as every seems to claim.  For a reasonable deduction in armor a druid can buff himself and a group, heal in a pinch, travel faster (cheetah), etc etc... so why wouldn't a group want a feral druid as their tank?<br />
<br />
Are there any high level druids who have specialized in feral bear abilities and tank equipment who can tell me the problems with a high level bear tank?  Do these numbers actually mean anything or is there something that the stats don't show?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1K is a huge difference in AC values.  I didn't make high level 35 was as high as I got with stress and open beta.  At that point I could already see the difference in tanking abilities; dire bear takes effect for druids about the same time that warriors and palidins switch from mail to plate so I don't believe there is much difference between what a druid in bear can do vs a mail wearer and what a druid in dire can do vs a plate wearer.  <br />
<br />
Personally I'd never put a druid up as main tank for an instance or a dungeon.  I don't see the druid in feral form as a pure tank, I see it as a damage absorber; when a add is wrecking havoc the druid can keep it occupied until crowd control takes effect, possibly but not necessarily as effectively as an off tank would.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't try to look at druids vs warriors they aren't going to be in competition the versatility of the druid is a plus when looking druid vs 2nd warrior.  Where we start to hurt is druid vs paladin.  The paladin can effectively pick up the same role as the warrior and can also heal and res.  However the druid paladin combination is a good combination if the paladin is performing the main tank role.<br />
<br />
The druid can fill many roles in a group the problem with the druid is that we can't fill any role as effectively as a pure class can do so.  The benefit of the druid isn't in what we can do as far as tanking/damage/healing alone but what we can do in combination.  A druid is going to have to be versatile just as in EQ a druid that says I only want to do X is going to have a harder time than a druid that is willing to do what is necessary and best for the group.</div></div><hr />

There is a ton of difference between a plate wearing MT and a druid in bear form MTing. If you take a druid as a tank, you have to be really careful on the pulls, take it slow. Quite a lot of mana is going to be used keeping the druid alive. Levels 45-55 I'd say they tank almost on the level of a rogue with taunt moreso than the warrior or paladin.<br />
<br />
Druids are great off tanks, good backup healers. A lot of the issues with the class boil down to 1) gear/stats for the different forms (including weapons factoring for dps) 2) generalists need to be more like 80/80/80 (or more) of the parent class. There needs to be enough of a difference so that druids don't replace, say, the warrior, but not so much that performing the role is all but impractical.<br />
<br />
As it stands right now, druids are not close to that 80/80/80 ballpark for the shapeshifting forms. Caster form is pretty decent, cat form comes nowhere close to rogue in dps or abilities. Bear form doesn't have the AC (nor the block/parry/dodge) needed to make them a good fallback option if no warriors can be found. <br />
<br />
However, for the soloing/duoing/questing for the more casual playstyle, druids are quite able to handle themselves and their groupmates. Pretty much every druid that I talked to that loved the class had the more casual style, thus weren't really confronted with the problems you would encounter in the upper tier of instances. Right now I'd say that if you are NOT aiming for serious end game instance runs and raiding then the druid is a very good choice to play. This could easily change though with just a few changes to the class.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd give the class a B-.</div></div><hr />
