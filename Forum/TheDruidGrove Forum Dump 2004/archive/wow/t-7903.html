<br />
In the upcoming beta patch, we plan to allow characters to untrain in talents freely in order to better help balance the talents. However, we feel that investing in talents is a commitment that defines and distinguishes one's character and should not be allowed to be changed freely. Although we do not have a structure for how this will work in retail as of yet, we do intend to have a penalty to prevent players from talent-hopping to suit situations on the fly. <br />
<br />
<br />
About this.... I'm not a fan of the whole ability to untrain talents thing, I hope the penalty/cost for untraining a talent is severe enough to deter people simply min-maxxing to the best talent build.<br />
<br />

Hopefully they strike a good balance between making it hard enough so people don't change every day but easy enough so that people DO actually change rather than whining.   Although, the chances of a halt to whining about anything are slim to none.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, I just hope the penalty is enough that everyone doesn't just blow away their talents on a whim or because someone found something &quot;better&quot;... otherwise what's the point of the talent system since it's main goal is to make characters unique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feldaran</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here comes the realist again: can't have unique characters in MMORPG's. If there is a &quot;best&quot;, people will be it. If they can't be it, they will whine until the &quot;best&quot; is no longer the &quot;best&quot;. Rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
6 person D&amp;D group = Every char can be a hero, all can be unique<br />
<br />
3,000 people on a server = none can be unique<br />
<br />
That's just how it goes.</div></div><hr />

Be a good player, get a good rep. I was in my server's uber guild in EQ, and I know I'd take some FAR less well equipped people with me to group than some incredibly geared dorks/arses that were in that guild.</div></div><hr />
