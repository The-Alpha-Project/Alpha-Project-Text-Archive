For the sake of discussion so far, let's take his information at face value.<br />
<br />
The thing that pleases me most about the info is the Launch Date info, specifically The official line is still &quot;later this year&quot;, but the producer mentionned that Blizzard will honor their quality policy and delay the release the necessary time if it is determined that the game needs added polish.<br />
<br />
It's nice to know Blizzard still has the dedication to their customers to ensure that the end product is up to their excellent standards.  (keep in mind that Diablo and Diablo 2 were blizzard north, essentially another company altogether)</div></div><hr />

The 3k server population thing disturbs me, but I guess that's 1500 horde-alliance if it's evenly split, which might not be too bad.  (FFXI had peak server pops of around 4k, with popular exp zones having up to 100-150 people in them... talk about crowded.)</div></div><hr />
