<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the help of an interface bug resulting in the loss of my level 45 Rogue, I've spent a lot of time on my Druid since this last patch (with the advent of talents as an extra incentive).   I've planned from day one to play a druid at launch and have avoided playing one extensively to keep the class &quot;fresh&quot; for myself, well, now that I have a much clearer idea of how HUGE this game really is, I'm not overly worried about wearing myself out on any particular class, especially with the versatility I've found in the Druid class as it stands right now.<br />
<br />
Predominantly I'm a group player, however, with this little article in mind I've done my best to split my time evenly between grouping and solo so I can attempt to give my perspective on both playstyles.<br />
<br />
First, let me say that playing a Druid is a LOT of fun, playing a Druid effectively can be a lot of work though.  <br />
<br />
Through the lower levels the learning curve is pretty steep, but the penalties aren't too harsh, from 1-15 I died maybe 3 times, granted I've had some practice and time with the game mechanics.  From levels 1-10 the class is pretty much a light healer, thanks to spells like healing touch (One shot) and Rejuvination (Instant Cast HoT),  with adequate melee and some decent offensive spells such as Wrath (One Shot) and Moonfire (DoT).  Once you get past the idea that Entangling Roots (a hold spell) is unpredictable and somewhat like playing the lottery as far as it's success (I've been told this is due to a bug), you can get on with enjoying the rest of the class, which despite being a jack-of-all trades, master of none, isn't too shabby.<br />
<br />
One thing I learned fairly quick is that the Instant Cast HoT's (Heal over Time's) aren't just for recovering HP, they make a decent little buff if cast right before going into battle, a little boost that i'm sure has saved me from getting ganked quite often.  That's another thing thing about the class, we're the King/Queen/Non-gender-specific-person-of-high-station of Buffs, even though we only really get two, Thorns and Mark of the Wild are two Buffs no-one should ever leave home without.<br />
<br />
After you've progressed through the first 10 levels, you get your first shapeshift Form, Bear Form.  While the attack rate is slow and the damage is low, Bear Form is clearly second only to the warrior as a tank when used properly, and it's a handy Form for grouping at low levels.  Don't discount Bear Form from being useful solo though, it has a nice stun ability called Bash that you pick up at 14 that is a real boon as an interrupt when combating casters, and the ability to debuff the armour of all the mobs around you with Demoralizing Roar can be quite useful in taking out tank-like mobs.  Note: Be careful using Demoralizing Roar near neutral mobs as it will effect them too and turn them on you.<br />
<br />
At level 15 is when the difficulty seems to change drastically for all players, up until 15 the mobs have relatively low aggro ranges (at 5 and under most mobs actually don't aggro at all until attacked), at 15 mobs aggro ranges expand and they tend to wander more frequently.  They'll also often call to each other or if you're fighting a humanoid mob, they'll run towards their companions most of the time when their health is low, instead of simply running away from you... this means they'll come back with friends.  <br />
<br />
You can expect to die more frequently post-15 in any class, and generally this is where you get the idea whether or not you're playing your class to a desirable level of competence (I am not a suitable Shaman or Paladin for instance).  One of the keys to mastering the Druid class is to be proficient and know when to shapeshift during combat, both to and from your animal Forms.<br />
<br />
At 16 you gain Aquatic Form, essentially a scary looking seal.... thing.  This Form is predominantly a nice travel Form for water, you can swim at roughly the speed you can run on water, and you can dive as deep as you please and stay under without drowning, you only get a basic attack in this Form, there's been no mention on whether anything more will be added later (i hope so).  I've actually found it faster to dive into the canals of Stormwind and switch to Aquatic Form to get from one end of the city to the other :D.<br />
<br />
The next thing of note is another debuff at 18 called Faerie Fire, which debuffs the armour of the enemy from caster Form softening them up for combat, a nice Faerie Fire, Moonfire combo is a handy way to open a fight.<br />
<br />
At 20 you get Cat Form, honestly, having played a rogue, I'm a little biased towards the Cat Form as that's essentially what it is.  Besides that, it looks cool :D.  Cat Form is all about dishing it out, and is by far the Druids most effective Form for dishing out pure damage at a fast rate, while most druid spells can outdamage single strikes from the Cat Form, once you work in casting time, Cat Form dishes out more damage overall, and Cat Form's ability to &quot;Prowl&quot; AKA the Rogue's &quot;Stealth&quot; makes this Form very handy for getting past mobs you're not in the mood to fight (murlocs anyone?).  Cat Form, like the Rogue class, has the ability to build up combo points for particular attacks, and then spending those combo points to dish out varying damage (depending on the number of combo points) with a finishing move, of course, the first finishing move you get for Cat Form is Rip, which is a DoT instead of a burst of damage, but later on you will get more finishing moves.<br />
<br />
As far as Talents are concerned, though I can't at this point tout any particular tree, having looked over them all, there seems to be a decent level of customizability available between the 3 trees.  If you want to focus on being a healer you can pump all your points into the Restoration tree and nearly match a Priest for heals (though with no Resurrect); If you want to focus on Shapeshifting you can throw all your points into Feral Combat and beef up your Shapeshifting Forms, making them more than capable at their roles, and the Balance tree offers a good number of spell improvements and Talent-based spells to make you a powerful caster in Druid Form.<br />
<br />
Though there are a few annoying bugs still lurking around the Druid and his Forms, with this last patch Druids became a force not easily discounted.<br />
<br />
So having played a Druid this patch, from level 1 to level 20, I'm impressed, through these levels at least I've had no problem finding a group and holding my own, I'm enjoying the class more than I have in any other MMO, and though Druids are by definition Jack-of-All-Trades, I don't feel overly weak in any of the roles I fill.  I'm greatly looking forward to the next 20 levels (provided I can do them before Beta ends :)).  I'll write another article when i Ding 40.</div></div><hr />

My initial thought was to test the druid out a bit, but not play her TOO much because I didn't want to get tired of her before retail (there's a lot of that going around ;) ). She's level 12 now, and I just cannot leave her alone. I have a level 4 shaman and a level 4 mage, and a warlock I haven't even tried yet, but the druid has captured my heart. Even at level 12, she has a versatility that kinda boggles my mind.<br />
<br />
I see absolutely no issues with playing her all the way through beta, and then re-rolling and doing it all again. :)</div></div><hr />
