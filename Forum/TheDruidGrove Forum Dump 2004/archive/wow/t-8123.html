<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solstas</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously its a little late to start suggesting something so sweeping, but in reading the 2nd book in the Warcraft: War of the Ancients trilogy, I had a thought.  A central theme in that series is the birth of the druidic class (Malfurion being the first druid).  Another major player is the concept of casters working together, filtering their energies through a single mage, and he wielding all their power combined.  <br />
<br />
My idea is this; allow a caster (druid!) the ability to serve as a &quot;lightning rod&quot; of magic.  Have a way for other casters to devote their entire will to that single caster, increasing his power immensely with each added mage but decreasing them to near uselesness.  Obviously the power would need to increase by factors, as otherwise it would make just as much sense to just remain as individuals.<br />
<br />
The possibilites are endless, and it would certainly be original in an MMORPG (that I know of).  Imagine a druid that could draw on the special powers to cast a very powerful AoE root, or cause the Moon to shine so brightly as to wound and stun all in the room...at the great expense of several casters mana.  <br />
<br />
Clearly there are more creative out there than me, but it sounds like something interesting to build upon, perhaps.  I must also admit, that in the books, Malfurion (the druid) isn't actually the one that does this...its mostly his brother (a mage)...but don't let them get wind of that!<br />
