<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many of you have asked about your role in groups. I'd like to address that question today. The developers have attempted to make as few rock-hard “roles” as possible; all classes should complement each other. A priest is not just a “heal-bot”. When there are classes that can tank and classes that can heal, however, role definition does appear in some form. Please don’t take this post as the One True Way to Play. Explore all the abilities open to your class. Experiment with different class combinations in groups. We’re not telling you how to play the game – one of the fascinating practices of this genre is the ingenuity exercised by the players every day! <br />
 <br />
The Druid has three potential roles in a group. When in their normal, biped form, they act well as a healer and can give support in the form of buffs and debuffs; they also have limited crowd control against dragons. Their Bear form gives them offensive and defensive power enough to step up to a monster and take the hits (we’re looking into aggro management for the form). In Cat form, the Druid becomes a damage dealer. This trio of roles in one class gives the Druid a diverse feel and allows them to perform nearly any role perceived as “needed” in a party. <br />
 <br />
Please keep in mind that there is not meant to be one &quot;master&quot; of any role. In a game with this many classes, our goal is to make the classes roughly equal in efficiency when filling the roles they're meant to fill, though the gameplay experience may vary between classes. Tanks are not meant to be carbon copies of each other, for example; they should all fill that role efficiently, however, enough so that they are viable and wanted in groups for that role. Each crowd control class should be able to manage small groups at times; they may simply be more effective in certain situations. We are aware that some classes do not currently fill the roles given to them; the development team is hard at work bringing them closer to their planned purpose. <br />

Well, Blizzard has made their intentions clear, what are your thoughts?<br />
<br />
Personally, it fits what I thought they were doing perfectly, now... can they pull it off?</div></div><hr />

I tend to stay away from the WoW boards simply because most of the people posting there are whining cry babies wanting everything to make them a god of somesort.  So thanks for posting the news link.</div></div><hr />

I was really begining to wonder if druids were really that bad. It's nice to know I am not the only one who thinks they are way to whinny on the WoW boards!</div></div><hr />

Back to the point though, when I see something like this I get a little leery after years of EverQuest. It's fine for classes to be generalists in most settings, but once you start to get to raids or high level encounters, generalists struggle unless they have at least one thing they do well. (a unique and necessary buff or debuff as an example)<br />
<br />
Ah well, I really should have more faith in Blizzard, they've not let me down since um... well... ever. :)</div></div><hr />

They can be an enjoyable class, but once you get into things that are very challenging for your groups, or likely raids as well, you question the usefulness of a druid. A warrior will tank a hell of a lot better (especially with the armor nerfing last patch), rogue will do more DPS, a priest will heal a lot better. So when you're pushing the limit on what your group can do, the druid looks like a poor choice to have around.</div></div><hr />

Also a druid makes a great secondary healer or wipe protection since they can switch to tank mode in a crisis.</div></div><hr />
