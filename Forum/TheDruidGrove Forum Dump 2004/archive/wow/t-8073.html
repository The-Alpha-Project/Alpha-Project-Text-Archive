<br />
Cosmos UI (http://www.cosmosui.org) - Very popular during beta, and very nice, although it includes a lot of junk that I'll never use.  I do especially like the Quest Minion though, it's a little window that keeps count of various quest related things when relevant, like how many items left to gather or mobs left to kill.<br />
<br />
GypsyMod (http://gypsymod.the-mad.net/) - Just found this one, looks quite nice.  This one has the added feature of allowing all UI elements to be dragged and moved to new locations, as well as all the usual ui mods.  I havent tried it yet, but my one beef is that they seem to have eliminated the lag-o-meter completely, which I like, being on dialup 8)<br />
<br />
Any other good ones out there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pretty much just use Cosmos, mainly because Thottbot is tied into it (though with this last patch, the thottbot data collection is creating some serious lag).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, I use Cosmos too, not had any collection lag problems, do you have Heavy Data Collection turned on or just the normal one lagging you out? But yea, well Cosmos has a ton of options I'll probably never use, it's nice to have them there. The biggest ones I use is second hotkey bar and Thottbot.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty simple and i provide no support for it or promised updates as pretty much I created it for myself and have made it available for others to use.  There is NO menu for options, if you don't want a feature, remove it's folder from the Interface folder.<br />
