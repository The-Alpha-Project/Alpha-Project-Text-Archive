(I haven't really screened this post yet.. so pardon any spelling, etc.. mistakes)<br />
 <br />
Priest:<br />
<br />
 Healer<br />
 Nuker<br />
 Rune Tanking<br />
 Aggro Machine!<br />
 Rez'r<br />
 DoTs!<br />
 Regen<br />
 RUNE! RUNE! RUNE!<br />
 Mezzer!<br />
 (Level 14) Nullify Disease<br />
 (Level 18) Dispell Magic<br />
Tobe the Level 1 Priest<br />
 <br />
I came into the world of warcraft.. the first friendly face I look upon sends me off to Protect the Lands from those that would ruin it. So off I go.. rounding up body parts collecting a bits of copper.. Woosh.. I feel my strengths return almost instantly .. Level 2.. by this time I have completed the quest at hand and moving right along to several other quest.<br />
 <br />
Tobe looks around.. and finds that the faces who challenged him for that one last spider kill or fighting to unlock the chest of &quot;phat lewts&quot; were moving on and moving deeper into the wilderness.. I looked upon the quest givers who were leading me away from this now tamable forest .. and I took on these task and venture forth.<br />
 <br />
At first I felt that I was constant running back and forth between cities.. but I was learning the lay of the land. I was destroying Wolfs.. weeding out the evil Sprouts (they were not little sprouts!). I had a sense that the knowledge I was gaining from the quest givers was worth all my effort.<br />
 <br />
Noted: Though after a while some rewards did not suit the priesthood as one would hope.<br />
 <br />
As I grew I became more and more bolder.. putting my tools of trade to the test so to speak. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/1_small.jpg (http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/1.jpg)<br />
 <br />
Time to move on<br />
 <br />
Again the quest givers were leading me away from this now semi-tamable land (heh). So I looked around.. &quot;What.. What is Darkshores.. Grove of Ancients?? <br />
 <br />
So I met up with this fellow named Pook.. he too was looking for this Grove of Ancients... he kept asking me if I was ready.. (picture is worth &quot;1000&quot; words).<br />
 <br />
 <br />
http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/2_small.jpg (http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/2.jpg) http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/3_small.jpg (http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/3.jpg) http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/4_small.jpg (http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/4.jpg)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
So we Travel forth into the new lands... and found this Grove of Ancients.. and completed the task.<br />
 <br />
I tried to complete some of the different quest as I was learning my way around these new lands.. I felt that I needed to team up.. with another. We were doing very well on this Crab Leg quest untill we found ourself stuck .. in the water.<br />
 <br />
/Stuck Command = basically kills you without losing any experience - very nice command though it takes about 2 mins before it actual activates and you can't move or complete any actions while in this mode.<br />
 <br />
Basically you kill yourself and become a ghost<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Tobe is now Level 11 and has traveled to the Lands of Azeroth and met up with some fellow mates. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
He has learned much about his class and there is much more to learn before he is done.<br />
 <br />
Healer<br />
<br />
 That is our primary role in groups<br />
 The heals scale up very nicely so far.<br />
 Strictly healing will get you killed fast.<br />
Nuker<br />
<br />
 Nukes damage is very random<br />
 You have two types of nukes, Cast time nukes, and Insta Nukes (Level 10)<br />
 You have the ability to stregthen your nukes with skill points.<br />
 The spell will continue to cast as the mob try's to interupt you.. this is where Rune is important, You don't get interupted unless thrown to the ground.<br />
Rune Tanking<br />
<br />
 Well I wouldn't advise tanking, but with a good Rune on you can stand there and take the hits while others pull mobs off you.<br />
 Rune cast times are very fast.<br />
 Its a must for solo'ing<br />
Aggro Machine!<br />
<br />
 OMG! - AoE Heal Aggro! This is the only thing that hasn't changed in the Hate system between EQ and WoW.<br />
 Do I hate this?<br />
 Yes.. but what is the alternative?<br />
Rez'r<br />
<br />
 Yes we ressurect!<br />
 Running so far in Ghost form &gt; then Rez<br />
 Ressurection is a Huge amount of mana.<br />
DoTs!<br />
<br />
 I love the DoT line for Priest.<br />
 From what I can see so far they are the strongest DoTs out there.<br />
 Resistance could be a bit less and I have found creatures that are immuned to DoTs.<br />
 You really can't kite dot (well to be honest you Can't Kite at all!)<br />
Regen<br />
<br />
 Regeneration needs to be less mana IMO.<br />
 Regeneration needs to be a faster cast.<br />
RUNE! RUNE! RUNE!<br />
<br />
 Rune Owns - No getting around it<br />
 The Fast Cast.<br />
 Pre-Runing is worth the effort<br />
 Rune + Travel saves your butt.. (in more ways then one)<br />
 I would say its the main source of power for the Priest Class.<br />
Mezzer!<br />
<br />
 Sleep is cool when it doesn't resist.<br />
 Sleep is too much mana.<br />
 Cast time is to long<br />
 Its a management tool but the long cast time negates some of the value of this spell.<br />
And more!<br />
 <br />
The Priest Class is coming a long very nicely, I am still in a learning phase.. (Level 11 now) but these are my findings so far. The Class is worth playing and quite frankly I see more Priest Building Groups then other classes. I am currently playing with Tailoring and hoping this brings me more fortune because the spells are very expensive.. but that is class wide.. which IMO is okay.. the more effort you put into quest, skills.. the more money you will make to cover your own personal desires for your class.<br />
 <br />
As for the Spell lines they are split into two Catagories.. Damage and Healing. The more skill points you spend increases your abilities in the role that you desire. Play style is everything and I believe Blizzard has done a great job in this for the priest class.<br />
 <br />
I will be posting more as I move a long to the next phase.. and hopefully many of you will be joining me when phase II comes out and by then.. I hope the Druid push is live!!! <br />
 <br />
Tobe the Priest - Part 2<br />
 <br />
And on to Azeroth<br />
 <br />
Well.. after traveling in Ghost form for what seemed to be around 2 hours of travel I finally made it to the city of Goldshire to meet up with some mates. To give you a brief feeling of how the zones are set up.. once I was on the Island of Azeroth. I never zoned once during that entire time. This is how big the World of Warcraft is.<br />
 <br />
Here is what I did after I traveled that entire distance:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/and_on_to_azeroth_files/image002.jpg (http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/6.jpg)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
My new found abilities and Grouping.<br />
 <br />
Earlier discussions were on “two different spell lines”. I will go into the Holy Line.<br />
 <br />
Level 12 as a priest we received two upgrades and one new addition to my Holy Line of spells<br />
 <br />
Holy Word: Shield<br />
Holy Magic<br />
35 Mana<br />
Instant cast<br />
40 yd range<br />
 <br />
Instantly shields the target, absorbing 83 damage. Lasts 1 min. While the shield holds, spells will not be interrupted by physical attacks<br />
 <br />
Holy Word: Fortitude<br />
Holy Magic<br />
65 Mana<br />
Instant cast<br />
30 yd range <br />
 <br />
Holy power infuses the target increasing their Stamina by 4 for 30 min. <br />
 <br />
Inner Fire<br />
Holy Magic<br />
20 Mana<br />
Instant cast<br />
 <br />
A burst of Holy energy fills the caster, increasing his damage by 2 and armor by 60 for 3 min.<br />
 <br />
Holy: – Beneficial type spells; Heals (direct healing and regens), buffs, self buffs, dispels, cures, Runes and Direct Damage (Nukes).<br />
 <br />
Shield = Rune. Works for incoming melee damage “Nukes bypass the rune”.<br />
 <br />
Fortitude: Stamina increases Hitpoints as it does in EQ. The formula is based on Class from what I can tell.<br />
 <br />
20 Warrior, 18 Pal, 16 Rogue etc.<br />
 <br />
Inner Fire: Self only buff, increases AC and damage output<br />
 <br />
AC: (damage reduction) = (.3 * (armor class - 1)/(10*level+89))<br />
 <br />
Level 14 I will discuss Shadow Magic! <br />
 <br />
Grouping of course allows you to complete some of the harder quest where you can duo mobs. A good warrior and priest can do much during these lower levels of the game. Solo it can be accomplished just very slow and adds = Death especially if they are nuking you!<br />
 <br />
Runes ala: Shields UP!<br />
 <br />
Insta cast Shielding that absorbs incoming melee and is castable on other players. “brought a pic for you to look at”<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/and_on_to_azeroth_files/image004.jpg (http://sobesfiles.supremeserver5.com/wow/7.jpg)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Shield can aggro but they are very low hate: IE: Pre-Shield your Tanks.<br />
 <br />
Awesome spell and just gets better as you gain Ranks.<br />
 <br />
Enough of the Magic talk for now.. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Lets talk about Tailoring.. Yes folks Sewing isn’t just a girl thing it’s a necessity for not just our Armor.. but if you’re a pack rat like me.. You can make your own bags.<br />
 <br />
I also had to learn skinning so I could make these bags. Overall I hate trade skills.. but I will tell you… NO FAIL COMBINES ROCK! So I am living with it and bringing up my skills. Tobe (Trade) LTB Linen Cloth!! <br />
 <br />
So far.. I have made a Robe and a Shirt and all my bags. I am starting to look.. Good!<br />
 <br />
Some pic’s of WestFall and my new Robe! And yes – The belt that I am wearing.. actual shows up as the color of the belt!.. very nice feature.. being unique is so important IMO. <br />
 <br />

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Well that's it for now.. when I hit 14-15 I will be posting again with some updates on Shadow Magic – Tailoring – and hopefully some new locations.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Tobe the Priest - Part 3<br />
 <br />
<br />
Level 14 -18 <br />
 <br />
I have been busy (Real Life also) - But here is the latest installment of the Tobe's Adventures. On the Continent of Azeroth, as you all know.. I worked my way down.. in Ghost form to Stormwind (Goldshire) and took a rez from a Spirit Healer. I was young still and experience loss was still minor but it was better then traveling in corporeal form. <br />
 <br />
Once in Stormwind, I worked all the quest I could find.. these quest brought me both to Sentinel Hill, where more quest were acquired and to Lakeshire and Darkshire.. even more quest. During this time I have been working my Tailoring Skills.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Tailoring Consist of obtaining &quot;cloths&quot; from various level creatures or buying them in some of the Major cities like Stormwind. So either spend your hard earned cash or get out and kill stuff!<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I also took up skinning so I could make bags (they need; so far - Light Leather and Medium Leather patches).<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Tailoring atm is 113, I am very close to using Silk which is where the money is &quot;Phoenix Pattern&quot; items which increase Mage Fire Damage etc.. (Focus type gear). But so far my gear is limited to Woolen Boots (11 Armor +2 Stam), Pearl-Clasped Cloak (12 Armor +1 Intellect) and much more in the Wool Factory, passed when I get silk which I will play with after. And of course my Green Woolen Bags that doesn't do anything special.. uses medium leather over the other bag which uses light leather and of course Green Dye.. but it gives me a couple extra skill ups because its a higher level. It was my hope that these bags would reduce or would gain something special over the other bags because of the different materials they use.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

 <br />
Shadow Magic<br />
 <br />
What is Shadow Magic? - Well to nail it down to one word I would say.. this is the &quot;Unholy&quot; side of a Priest.. IE: Partly Defensive.. Partly Offensive spell sets. The only problem is.. Holy Smite series of spells is Holy Magic so.. /blinks - anyhow..<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Sleep, Pacify, Mind Blast, DoTs, Brain Wash, Mana Taps, etc.. are all Shadow Magics. Of course all spells can be memmed at once. (well up to 72 of them!).<br />
 <br />
Level 20 gets a bit interesting for a Priest because here you can Pacify and lower the threat level of mobs.. and further down the road you can steal mana.. which will be needed by this priest! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The blue bar is mana, it is regened by drinking various beverages. You don't sit to med your mana up, you drink. One cool feature is you can see the mana bar of opposing mobs, and can tell when they are getting lom. <br />
<br />
Melee PC's have a yellow bar instead of blue. The yellow bar is like Endurance, it gets eaten when you use your skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araxx Darkroot</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the purple bar with groves along the bottom part of the screen?<br />
And the little icons? I imagine the ones on the left (taking as example Tobe's first screenie in his first post) are spells, but the ones in the same bar on the right? I see a computer there, a question mark, an exclamation mark, etc.<br />
I also imagine the items in the furthest block to the right are the inventory items. They clickable? switchable, etc.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cprender</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Purple Bar all the way accross the middle is the exp bar. Hovering over the bar tells you your numeric progress into the level, i.e. 3045/8000.<br />
<br />
The icons on the left are user definable hotkeys, and can be skills, clickies, spells, food, drink, etc. There is a small up/down arrow at the right of this area that takes you to other pages for more hotkeys<br />
<br />
The icons in the middle are all tools and options like quests, report issues, setup...<br />
<br />
The right hand side is inventory. Inventory space is very precious so far. It looks like it may be a game balance mechanic, as certain classes require reagents, and reagents don't stack. <br />
<br />
There is a big map to the upper rigth that shows cities and town (and your corpse, hooray). Next to it are buffs and spell effects both positive and negative. <br />
<br />
I haven't played a caster yet, so I don't know if their interface differes significantly, but Sobe's looks pretty much the same.</div></div><hr />
