No class can charm, Mages get sleep. Sleep is Mez in a nut shell.<br />

If you want a pet, you would want to make a Warlock.</div></div><hr />

Priests get CC like spells, but I don't think you can put them in the same class as a charm.<br />
<br />
Priests:<br />
<br />
Threat/Crowd Control/Pulling Abilities <br />
Brainwash - Removes an amount of threat for all enemies of the target. This spell is useful to make a monster stop attacking someone (for example, you or a weak caster) and transfer its hate (threat) to another target, such as a tank.<br />
 <br />
Mind Soothe - Calms the target, reducing the range at which it will attack you by X yards. This ability is useful for pulling. The Priest calms one target, then pulls another nearby monster without setting off (waking up) the calmed monster. <br />
<br />
Psychic Scream - The caster lets out a psychic scream that causes X nearby enemies to run away. This is a good crowd control spell when pulls go bad. <br />
<br />
Shackle Undead - Shackles the target undead enemy for up to X sec. Any damage caused will release the target. Only one target can be shackled at a time.</div></div><hr />

They used to have the ability to take control of a target for a specified amount of time.  Unlike traditional charm though, they would actually become that entity for the time period and their priest character would stand there stationary.</div></div><hr />

Just FYI.<br />

 <br />
 Mage:<br />
<br />
   	<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
  Frost Nova: Cooldown slightly increased. 	    <br />
<br />
  Polymorph: New spell added. Polymorph transforms the enemy into a sheep, forcing it to wander around for the duration of the spell. While wandering, the sheep can not attack or cast spells and will regenerate health very quickly. Any damage will transform the target back into its normal form. Only one target can be Polymorphed at a time. Polymorph will only work on Beasts, Dragons, Giants, Humanoids and Critters. 	    <br />
<br />
  Sleep: Sleep is being changed to Polymorph. 	    <br />
<br />
  New Portal Spells have been added for each major city</div></div><hr />
