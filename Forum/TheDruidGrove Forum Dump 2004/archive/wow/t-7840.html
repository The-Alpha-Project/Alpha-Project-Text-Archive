Katricia responded:<br />
<br />
<br />
The development team is still in the process of making an armor polish pass. The goal of this pass is to make armor more desirable and interesting to the players. A complete set armor bonus is being considered by the team. No decisions have been made at this time. <br />

Now, the people in the thread seem to mostly like the idea and how it would encourage people to wear matched sets of clothing instead of that one item of clothing because it gives 2 more AR but doesn't match a thing you're wearing.<br />
<br />
I like the idea :)<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts?<br />

Most of which are based on how creative Blizzard is with the game.  In general I love the idea of sets, but I've never seen them implemented a useful way.<br />
<br />
Here's a thought...<br />
<br />
Lets say you have full set of &quot;Lotharun's Stormcaller&quot; Armor.  Oh, and for fun let's say the set doubles your sneak and at the same time halfs your hitpoints.  Now lets say that the ability is click activated, lasts 2 minutes and has a 5 minute reuse timer.  That's a set you'll probably want to hold on to, no?  In this case, the value of the set would likely be enough to make you want to hold on to.  This would be a valuable set.<br />
<br />
Another thought, though not nearly as interesting would be if say your &quot;Lotharun's Stormcaller&quot; BP is 12AC, 3 to all stats, obtained at say L20.  Down the road you've completed your set, but the stats are starting to lag.  You get lucky and off a mob drops a &quot;Lotharun's Stormcaller&quot; BP that is 75AC, 25 to all stats - effect Regeneration.  This allows you to keep your set as your primary armor and upgrade as you go.<br />
<br />
This only a tastes of the possibilities.</div></div><hr />

Something highly unique.  Fashion after all, is part of the game.</div></div><hr />
