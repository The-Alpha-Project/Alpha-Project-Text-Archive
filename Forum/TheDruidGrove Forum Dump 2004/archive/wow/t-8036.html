Nice to meet you, as you can probably tell by my name and sig. Druid is more than likely not going to be my main (I think I am going warlock  :vampire: ). But it will problably be my main alt. Its so hard to tell until I get into beta :banghead_ :cry:<br />
<br />
Anyway I had a question on talent builds. Do you think its ok to spread your points across two or three trees to get only the low to mid level talents? or is it a waste to not specialize in one to get the high end talents?<br />
<br />
This is a build I was playing around with with the idea of adapting to any situation quickly and buffing some of the commonly used spells.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
Class: Druid<br />
Level: 60<br />
<br />
Balance Talents (17 points)<br />
<br />
Nature's Grasp - 1/1 point<br />
While active, any time an enemy strikes the caster, they have a 35% chance to become afflicted by Entangling Roots (Rank 1). Only usable outdoors. 1 charge. Lasts 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
Improved Nature's Grasp - 4/4 points<br />
Increases the chance for your Nature's Grasp to entangle an enemy by 65%.<br />
<br />
Nature's Reach - 2/2 points<br />
Increases the range of your Wrath, Entangling Roots, Faerie Fire (caster form only), Moonfire, and Starfire spells by 20%.<br />
<br />
Swiftshaping - 3/3 points<br />
Reduces the cooldown on your non-shapeshifting spells by 1.5 seconds after shapeshifting to caster form.<br />
<br />
Improved Entangling Roots - 3/3 points<br />
Gives you a 100% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting Entangling Roots.<br />
<br />
Omen of Clarity - 1/1 point<br />
Imbue the Druid's weapon with natural energy. Each hit has a chance of causing the caster to enter a Clearcasting state. The Clearcasting state reduces the Mana cost of your next damage or healing spell by 100%. The Omen of Clarity enchantment lasts 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Improved Starfire - 1/5 point<br />
Gives your Starfire spell a 3% chance to stun the target for 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Improved Thorns - 2/5 points<br />
Gives your Thorns spell a 10% chance to cause the target to take an additional 100% damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral Combat Talents (18 points)<br />
<br />
Ferocity - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the cost of your Maul, Swipe, Claw, and Rake abilities by 5 Rage or Energy.<br />
<br />
Sharpened Claws - 5/5 points<br />
Increases your critical strike chance while in Bear or Cat form by 5%.<br />
<br />
Improved Prowl - 5/5 points<br />
Increases your speed while prowling by 15%.<br />
<br />
Feral Charge - 1/1 point<br />
Causes you to charge an enemy, stunning it for 1 second and interrupting any spell being cast for 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Faerie Fire (Cat) - 1/1 point<br />
Decrease the armor of the target by 175 for 40 seconds. While affected, the target cannot stealth or turn invisible.<br />
<br />
Faerie Fire (Bear) - 1/1 point<br />
Decrease the armor of the target by 175 for 40 seconds. While affected, the target cannot stealth or turn invisible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration Talents (16 points)<br />
<br />
Improved Mark of the Wild - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the effects of your Mark of the Wild spell by 35%.<br />
<br />
Furor - 5/5 points<br />
Gives you a 100% chance to gain 10 Rage when you shapeshift into Bear form.<br />
<br />
Nature's Focus - 5/5 points<br />
Gives you a 60% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting the Healing Touch or Regrowth spells.<br />
<br />
Gift of Nature - 1/1 point<br />
Increases the effect of your Healing Touch, Rejuvenation, Regrowth, and Tranquility spells by 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!!!  :cheers:</div></div><hr />

Your list isn't mine exactly, but is similar.  I'd probably put a bit more into restoration.<br />
<br />
The thing is, most of the end of line talents aren't all that great for druids at the moment, imho.  The only one I can see specializing for would be Hurricane at the top of the balance tree.<br />
<br />
Now having said that, its still possible that talents will get further changed before release, so we'll see.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent tried any of the Beast talents yet..I guess just reading the descriptions they dont sound that great, maybe because I dont spend that much time shifted(I almost get better dsp meleeing).  And all the stock default abilities seem to do fine when i do shift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fully feral specced so far (mind you i'm only level 22 as a druid) and I spend almost all my time shifted.  If you spec in feral being in forms greatly improves, though from what i hear at the high end it still needs some adjustment in terms of the bear AC and the cat damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just dont see a point in fighting shifted, my dps isnt that much more shifted than my weapon melee and I can still cast.  <br />
<br />
If i do shift..its just to get come points in and a finishing move from cat, then shift back..i am never a bear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind you, i had one hell of a priest with me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shade Angel</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... Looks like I am going to have to play around with it in open beta and see what fits my play style better. I have a feeling I am going to be shape shifting a lot. Good thing open beta should be soon :)<br />
Thanks for the Info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuin</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree that your playstyle will really determine what tree you put the majority of your points in. Since I know already that I will be in a duo or grouped most of the time, I'm putting most of my points in restoration and a few in balance (mostly to get the swiftshaping ability). Open beta will help me figure that out for sure, however ;)</div></div><hr />
