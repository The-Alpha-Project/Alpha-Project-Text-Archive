Fileplanet ran out of keys in about 2 hours and people trying to create new accounts crashed www.worldofwarcraft.com (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) about halfway through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's saying 26hrs to download.  I guess it's a peer to peer downloader.  I'm guessing that I'm downloading from others and sharing it with others which is fine.  However, my CD drive started spinning like crazy with CnC Generals CD in it.  ....disturbing.</div></div><hr />

I hope Blizzard is breaking records with this distribution to justify the meager download times.  I actually plan on playing this game unless the beta sucks.  Yeah, I know aready - this game is awesome.  Can't wait to see for myself.</div></div><hr />

I am really loving this game.  Like anything, it isn't for everyone, but I think it is definitely worth giving it a try to see if it is for you :) Oh, and while the WoW website seems to be a little flakey, the servers have been very stable so far during the final stress test, if that is any comfort!</div></div><hr />
