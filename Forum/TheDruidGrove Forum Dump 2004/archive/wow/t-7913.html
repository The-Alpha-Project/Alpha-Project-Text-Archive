Rob Pardo has been busy on the World Of Warcraft (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) Forums today, giving us some missing patch notes concerning Item Attribute Changes (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=237633&amp;P=1) and the why of it, as well as enlightening us to Blizzard's Thoughts on Grouping (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=237676&amp;P=1).<br />
<br />
Both are rather interesting reads.<br />
<br />
Join us in discussion of both here (http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?p=114028#post114028).<br />

As for my Hunter Review, well, it's still in the works, it's been hard to get in any play time as some pretty beefy bugs have cropped up where server stability is concerned and it always seems to be down when I can play  :cry:</div></div><hr />
