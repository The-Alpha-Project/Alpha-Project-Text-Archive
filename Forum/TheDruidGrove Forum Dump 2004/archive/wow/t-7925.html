This exclusive set includes a polished collection of World of Warcraft cinematic and in-game movies that were shown at various industry trade shows over the years. Until now, many of these files were only available as separate downloads. <br />
In addition to acquiring a full series of critically acclaimed World of Warcraft movies, when you download the compilation you will be helping us test the new Blizzard Downloader. The Blizzard Downloader is being developed to ensure that we can deliver files such as game patches to you as quickly and as seamlessly as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
And by the looks of things they're back to bit-torrent for their downloaders.  There's been a lot of contraversy concerning bit-torrent as a distrobution method for WoW (I've liked the idea from the start), and after seeing that the alternative is fileplanet?!?! I prefer bit-torrent all the more.  <br />
<br />
What do you think of the media compilation? Which downloader do you prefer?<br />
