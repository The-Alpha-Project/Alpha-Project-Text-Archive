We have created a page on the Hunter. This gives you a heads up on some of the Hunter info prior to it being released. We are looking for your feedback on this page in the form of additions or corrections prior to it being officially posted for everyone. For information on how to submit feedback for the World of Warcraft guide, please go to http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faq/guide.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
Block made the announcement here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&amp;t=181345&amp;p=1#post181345).<br />
Feel free to discuss your thoughts on the new Hunter info here (http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?p=113971#post113971).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, wow, that's a LOT of info, you can see they've done a lot with the class!<br />
<br />
I find the pet happiness/feeding part rather interesting, looks like we'll have to keep an eye on that :)<br />
Also the ability to have multiple pets is a great relief, I was worried about having to retrain them any time i switched, but it's nice to know if i pick a beast that doesn't suit me i haven't lost my other pets :D<br />
<br />
The aspects are interesting, I imagine their either traditional buffs or like the warrior's stances, I'll check into it as soon as the class is playable.<br />
<br />
Feign Death!  I can see me using that a lot... or just dying :) Kinda useless in PvP unless you're against a noob, but great for PvE.<br />
<br />
Soooo, since they're releasing all this info now, i hope the patch will be very early next week.</div></div><hr />
