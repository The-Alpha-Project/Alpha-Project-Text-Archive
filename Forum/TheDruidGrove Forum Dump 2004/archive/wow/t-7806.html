Remember that Alliance areas like Stormwind and Elwynn Forest were our initial zones and have continued to be our test areas. As such, these areas have received the most attention and improvements. <br />
   <br />
 I’m writing this to inform you that we’re planning to implement the fun things found in these areas into all of the locations of the world, including the Horde areas. <br />
   <br />
 Our overall goal is to polish all zones. We’d like to remind everyone that World of Warcraft is still in Beta, and that many of the features in the game will go through changes to make them more appealing for the majority of players. <br />
   <br />
  As a side note, don’t forget the many changes coming to the Barrens (from a previous post): <br />

  The Barrens <br />
   <br />
 The development team appreciates your comments and is already in the process of updating The Barrens. Other zones will be reevaluated in order of their “least favorite” status. <br />
   <br />
  Some of the areas that are being considered in regards to The Barrens: <br />
   <br />
  &lt;body&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adding/Activating new graveyards in the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Adding an additional Inn to the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluating ways to improve transportation in the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Reevaluating quests in the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Reevaluating NPC placement in the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Reevaluating creature placement in the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluating ways to add surprises and suspenseful areas to the zone. <br />
  &lt;li&gt;Adding Landmarks and areas of interest to the zone. <br />
  <br />
 Thanks again for your feedback!  We will keep you updated as content is changed and added. <br />

 ~Kat :) &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</div></div><hr />
