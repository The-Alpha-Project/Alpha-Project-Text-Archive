								This is one of the best threads I have seen on these boards in some time.  It is late for me and I have read most the text - I hope I have not overlooked any major points.
<br>
<br>I agree with the problems Dragonsword has identified - namely - inflation in the economy due to lack of currency control; and lack economic indicators since NPC vendors seem to be the brokers of the economy.
<br>
<br>Based on Everquest and what EQ II is talking about, I believe that EQ now and EQ2 will have superior economic systems to what has so far been said about WoW.  Anyway, borrowing these lessons:
<br>
<br>1.  Item Decay.  This can be implemented many ways - but it's obvious this goes a long way to combat inflation.  In EQ2 the first player to make or obtain a drop has no problem - but the item will slowly decay once it is sold to a second owner.
<br>
<br>2.  The Bazaar and NPC control.  In EQ there is a bazaar where players post their crafted and farmed goods for sale.  No NPC intervention no need for &quot;player shops&quot;.  A window comes up showing you all the prices of the goods by the various vendors.  You can track individual item value over time easily.  Very elegant economic indicator - even for the players to use.
<br>
<br>3.  Trivial Loot Code.  Implemented on the &quot;role playing&quot; server in EQ.  This also combats inflation.  This prevents your level 50 mage from farming special drops that level 30 players are after.  The rule states that if the mob you kill is trivial to you (e.g. you get no experience points) you do not get the special drop from that mob (the uber ring or sword).
<br>
<br>I believe the current EQ economy, at least on the role playing server is superior so far to what has been described for WoW.  Further, the proposed changes to this economy, in EQ2 (item decay) far surpasses WoW based on what we know.
<br>
<br># 1 is the most important rule.  It is the real world.  No need for complex algorithms to track moeny flow and artficially adjust things.

								Yay, my old WoW Economics thread came back! I don’t know why, but even though this thread is pretty serious and long I like it. Thanks for your post Banana Rebellion. Regarding the points you bring up...
<br>
<br>“Do you think having a fixed amount of gold per server could help solve any problems?”
<br>
<br>Yes maybe so, I’ve been thinking about this. The funny thing about money supply is its not as easy to define as you might think. In the real world economists recognise that there are a number of measurements of “supply of money” in an economy, all of which are useful. For example M1 might be money held in cash, M2 might be M1 plus money held in savings accounts, M3 might be M2 plus money held in term deposits and investment accounts, etc.
<br>
<br>As you go up to M4 and beyond money becomes less “liquid”, less free to be exchanged and flow through the economy. So to manage the economy a government will always have an M1 target, an M2 target, an M3 target etc. each of which needs to be monitored and fine-tuned through economic management. So, in the WoW economy I guess M1 will be gold actually held by characters, ready to spend. M2 will be M1 plus gold deposited in player bank accounts.
<br>
<br>M3 might be M2 plus gold held in chests and boxes in guild headquarters and player housing. M4 might be M3 plus gold held by monsters, shopkeepers and NPC characters below a certain rank. M5 might be M4 plus gold reserves held by the highest ranking NPCs like Kings, Warlords and Dragons. So Bliz could have a target for M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 and each of these targets could be monitored and adjusted.
<br>
<br>So by your suggestion to keep the total gold on the server “fixed” we are actually talking about fixing M5. This still leaves Bliz free to encourage movement of currency between M1, M2, M3 and M4 to manage inflation and unemployment. Now I really like it that you have suggested an economic formula, because economists love formulas. So I’m going to suggest some of my own formulas for the WoW economy...
<br>
<br>
<br>  M5 target can be one billion gold (or whatever amount Bliz chooses for the server total)
<br>
<br>  M4 target = (M5 – M3) x 80% + M3
<br>
<br>  M3 target =  C x L x 100 gold
<br>
<br>      Where C = number of Characters active on the server
<br>      Where L = average Level of all characters on the server
<br>
<br>  M2 target = M3 x 80%
<br>
<br>  M1 target = M3 x 20%
<br>
<br>
<br>To put the above into words, this means keep the total gold on the server fixed, let players have some part of that total based on how many characters there are on the server and what levels they are, and the rest is kept by NPCs. The top level NPCs will have 20% of total NPC wealth, the rest will be distributed among shopkeepers, monsters, will be guarded by creeps and NPC gangs etc. Then of the wealth that is held by players, make sure not more that 20% of it is hoarded in chests in guild headquarters and player housing, and not more than 60% of it is saved in the bank.
<br>
<br>I’m going to post some more economic formulas here later for application to the WoW economy, give me some time. Thanks also for your post exter penance, It was well thought out and I will respond to it soon. :D

								Nicely put l)ragonSword!  I think the M1, M2, M3, etc. concept could really help keep the economy balanced in World of Warcraft.  I particularly like your idea of having a maximum percentage of all gold that can be kept in guild chests/player housing.

								This is quickly becoming one of my favorite posts.
<br>
<br>Intelligent, thought out, and well written.
<br>
<br>The thing is, like in real world economies, only time will tell.  There can be a dozen theories thrown about, but again as in life, these are theories, that can only be shown to be true/false through a testing.
<br>
<br>Which is why I think it would be nice if they added this as part of the beta test, with different systems and theories on different servers.
<br>
<br>Some would have NPC as the main holders of wealth, others would have limits on gold on that server, and some perhaps test guild ran shops...
<br>
<br>Only through this test (at latter stages, after bugs have been mostly worked through) can the best economic system for WoW be found.
<br>
<br>...although when I read these posts, I can't help but feel like my mom saying &quot;If you only put as much thought and hard work into school....&quot;

								I'm really unsure that you can accurately test any games economic model thoroughly, let alone several models, in the short time span of a beta test.  When you look at how unnatural the gameplay is during a beta test, it only furthers the difficulty of translating results into expectations for results in retail.  I think the best thing you can do is make a solid robust model, test it as much as you can in beta (which isn't as much as it'd probably need) and then hope, monitor, and finely tune it as you go.

								I agree that the beta isn't the best setting, but it is one that can be manipulated with relative ease. And the beta will last a few months at least, giving a small and slight chance to know which one will for for the meanwhile. While having one robust model is the ideal, it still requires testing to be proven useable, and again, who's to say what's the best and most robust?

								I think there is an inherent problem in this whole discussion which has only been barely touched upon.
<br>
<br>First, the basis of this discussion is based around gold and vendors.
<br>
<br>When in actually, in terms of mmorpgs, the economies are usually based on the barter system.
<br>
<br>Store bought items tend to pale compared to monster drops or player crafted items.
<br>
<br>Also, since tradeskill items are farmed from the environment, there will be very little money being taken out this way.
<br>
<br>In addition, I believe Blizzard said there would be no item decay, so items will exist until destroyed purposely.
<br>
<br>Just looking at this, there will be no way to balance blizzard economy after a decent time of playing.
<br>
<br>1) No one will be buying from vendors, most will eventually either get mob drops or player made items.
<br>
<br>2) Players will continue to accumulate money and there are no apparent money sinks since vendors will be worthless and raw materials are mined.
<br>
<br>
<br>The only possible solution is to implement some form of trading system that has a tax such as possibly the guild houses mentioned earlier, but this can be circumvented.
<br>
<br>
<br>Eventually, money will be worthless and the economy will be based on a barter system.
<br>
<br>This is inevitable in a player crafted and treasure hunting economy.
<br>
<br>
<br>There is nothing that truly can be done since the best items worth acquiring are acquired outside of npc vendors.

								I disagree Heavenlyrain.  Using the fixed gold theory with the M1, M2, M3 thing that l)ragonSword and I discussed, Blizzard can manipulaate the economy to keep the value of gold and the purchasing from vendors from getting too out of balance.  Lets say that the amount of items bought from vendors starts to decline.  Blizzard could lower the prices of the items, reduce the amount of gold gained from creeps, and allow shops to sell more exotic items giving players an incentive to buy.  I think with a proper economic system in place, the economy won't get too barter driven and the value of gold won't get too low.

<br>I will take the route of explaining how it currently works in EQ as I can comment on that best.
<br>
<br>Many items are not bought from vendors after a time.  The armor that vendors first offered as expensive at some point becomes less than trash equipment.  However, there are many basic things that are bought.  Not all materials need necessarily be found by hunting or resource mining.  Also while you can get something from resource mining that doesn't mean you can't purchase it.  For those that want to get quick resources, and are willing to pay, they can purchase them from a merchant.
<br>
<br>Also take into consideration spells or skills that require a reagent.  I haven't heard if there are any, but this is a way to remove money from the player portion of the economy.  You might find the reagents out in the wild, but to have a sure supply on you at all times you would want to stock up at a merchant before setting out.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>2) Players will continue to accumulate money and there are no apparent money sinks since vendors will be worthless and raw materials are mined. <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>As I stated in response to #1, reagents can make up one portion of a money sink.  Any purchase that is made off of a merchant can be a money sink.
<br>
<br>Merchants don't have to be the sole source for an item, but there are always people willing to cut time and spend money buying something quick rather than farming it themselves or waiting for a low price from some player.
<br>
<br>Also as items go.  When the game advances to a certain point all those items that were low end but worth money when the game started become vendor fodder.  These items aren't worth the time selling to other players and so they are sold to vendors.  Now the next level of items becomes the low end tradeable items.  Here we see items are removed from the economy.  The lowest level items that have become vendor fodder are effectively removed from the game or cost much more than they should if somone wants to buy them from a vendor...and this would remove money from the economy win-win situation.

								I'ld like to compliment you |)ragonSword on your incredibly intelligent post for resurfacing, and for the ideas you've brought up, it is a great idea to have a fixed ammount of gold with a growing basis, but I might suggest per account rather than per character, or possibly actually go through, and roll up character by character as if this were D&amp;D, and once you've created each long lasting npc, create no more money in the game itself.
<br>
<br>IE:
<br>
<br>An entire town is comprised of hundreds of peasants, roll up their starting monetary value to an area in copper, and have the local &quot;rich merchant&quot; have all the money that was rolled up for these people, and as this merchant becomes broke from buying adventurer's supplies, his prices might inflate on potions?  Or something similar where an npc actually goes out of business as its total ammount of gold is given to the player base.
<br>
<br>Another town has the same thing happen, and fairly soon the players realize, there is no more gold going to be in the market, it begins to become incredibly valuable(I suppose this could be avoided by like you said having it grow per character) but we have a fixed gold economy, and as long as every player saves one gold per character... shoot I lost my train of thought
<br>
<br>
<br>Mebbe I'm not so good with fixed gold economy, I guess there has to be inflation

								Thanks for all your great posts! So much stuff to think about and respond to... nice. Anyway for starters, here is another economic formula I came up with that may be relevant to the WoW economy. Let me know what you think. :D
<br>
<br>Assuming there will be Guild Shops, or Player Controlled Shops, or a Bazaar, or a Player Market District, or in other words some form of market for exchange of goods and services between players, then:
<br>
<br>S2 Income (weekly) target = (((CS1 x LS1) + (CS2 x LS2)) x 5 gold) – S1 Income (weekly)
<br>
<br>Where S1 Income (weekly) = total income earned in one week by sales of items produced by primary trade skill S1 in all markets (across the server)
<br>
<br>Where S2 Income (weekly) = total income earned in one week by sales of items produced by secondary trade skill S2 in all markets (across the server)
<br>
<br>Where CS1 = total number of (active) characters specialising in primary trade skill S1
<br>Where CS2 = total number of (active) characters specialising in secondary trade skill S2
<br>Where LS1 = average level of characters specialising in primary trade skill S1
<br>Where LS2 = average level of characters specialising in secondary trade skill S2
<br>
<br>This formula can be easily re-arranged as follows:
<br>
<br>S1 Income (weekly) + S2 Income (weekly) target = ((CS1 x LS1) + (CS2 x LS2)) x 5 gold
<br>
<br>Lets put this into plain English. Blizzard has already announced that characters will be able to train and specialise in neutral “trade skills”, and these trade skills will (probably) come in pairs. For example herb gathering and alchemy will be a pair, mining and blacksmithing, food gathering and cooking, lumberjacking and carpentry/fletching, hunting and leatherworking, etc.
<br>
<br>Now we don’t want a situation where people specialising in some trade skills end up far wealthier than those specialising in other trade skills, so we need some mechanism to monitor trade skill related income. Lets look at herb gathering and alchemy (potion making) as an example. Herb gathering is the primary trade skill in this example (the first step) and alchemy (making potions) is the second step.
<br>
<br>Of those characters who gather herbs some will sell their herbs on the market, some will give their herbs directly to a character specialising in alchemy, and some may specialise in both herb gathering and alchemy. We want this group of characters as a whole to receive a certain amount of income each week for their gathering and potion making work. We want to take into consideration that some of their income will come from sale of herbs and some will come from sale of potions.
<br>
<br>So according to our formula the total income for this group should depend on the number of characters on the server with these skill specialisations, and the average level of these characters. Note that if a character specialises in S1 and S2 they will be “double counted” in both CS1 and CS2. This is fair because they will have devoted twice the number of skill points, paid twice as much in neutral skill training costs and made twice the commitment in time spent, so they will expect twice the rewards of a character only specialising in either S1 or S2.
<br>
<br>The formula will work the same way for any pair of trade skills. Therefore if there is a group of miners and blacksmiths on a server, and a group of food gatherers and cooks of equal size, and the average level of players in each group is the same, then these groups should earn more or less the same weekly income from sale of goods on the market produced using their trade skills.
<br>
<br>You can see that using this formula the expected weekly income of a level 20 character specialising in cutting lumber will be 100 gold. If they give their wood to a carpenter for free, then the carpenter creates bows and spears and staffs and wooden shields and sells them, then the carpenter will get about 200 gold and can give 100 to their wood cutting friend. If they specialise in cutting lumber and also specialise in carpentry, and use both skills, then their expected income from sale of wooden goods will be 200 gold.

								OK here is another possible formula for application to the WoW economy:
<br>
<br>AI target (weekly) = CAp x LAp x 5 gold
<br>
<br>Heh, pretty simple isn’t it?
<br>
<br>Where AI = Activity related Income 
<br>
<br>Where CAp = number of Characters who treat the Activity as their Primary activity
<br>
<br>Where LAp = average Level of characters who treat the Activity as their Primary activity
<br>
<br>Lets put this into English. In the World of Warcraft there will be a number of different activities that players can engage in to have fun and earn income. Different players will like doing different things, which is fine. Bliz has said they want the WoW world to be like a big toy that you can play around with, and everyone can enjoy themselves in their own way (world-as-a-toy philosophy).
<br>
<br>Some players will enjoy Solo Questing, which will occur mostly above ground. Some players will love Party Questing, which can be done above ground or down in Dungeons where the monsters are tougher. Some players will love Bounty Hunting and tracking down creeps and monsters on behalf of NPCs. Some players will get a kick out of finding recipes and using their Trade Skills to make and sell things. Some players will love fighting in Arenas in big cities, gambling and winning prizes.
<br>
<br>And some players won’t be able to keep away from the PvP Faction vs Faction battle zones. So, the idea is no matter what you like doing in WoW, you will stand an equal chance of earning a living from your activities. Obviously everyone is going to want to try some of everything, but players will inevitably develop favourite activities that they engage in more often than other activities. Characters may be developed to specialise in a particular type of activity, whether it be Arena Fighting, Party Questing or Crafting.
<br>
<br>Each character (by definition) will have a Primary Activity, which they spend more time on than other income generating activities. Therefore the formula says, if there are a group of characters who have Crafting as their primary activity, and another group who have Solo Questing as their primary activity, and another group who have Faction Wars as their primary activity, and each group is of equal size and the average level of characters in each group is roughly equal, then these groups should earn roughly the same amount of income in a week.
<br>
<br>Here we can’t define income as only gold, because players who quest or engage in PvP combat may receive rewards other than gold. For example in battle zones players will be able to capture buildings and towns, and gain temporary benefits and loot from the buildings captured. However, the fact is every item in WoW will have a value assigned to it by Bliz. This is inevitable so NPC storekeepers know how much to offer for the item when they buy it from you. So in our formula Income means gold plus value of other items obtained through the activity.
<br>
<br>Now we can see a possible conflict between this formula and the formula in my last post relating to distribution of income generated by trade skills. For example, what if we use the previously defined formula to calculate how much income various groups of crafters should receive in a week from the sale of crafted items, but when the weekly income for these various “craft groups” is added up the total is greater that the AI target for total Crafting Activity for that week?
<br>
<br>Here is a possible solution. In the previous Trade Skills income formula we replace “5 gold” with “X”. “X” will be defined as an amount of currency such that total trade skills income will equal the AI target (weekly) for characters whose primary activity is using trade skills. So, first we calculate the AI target (weekly) for Crafting Income using the formula above, maybe it will come to 50,000 gold or whatever. Then we stick the appropriate values into our previous formula and leave X as unknown:
<br>
<br>S1 Income (weekly) + S2 Income (weekly) target = ((CS1 x LS1) + (CS2 x LS2)) x “X”
<br>
<br>Now we define X as an amount of currency such that:
<br>
<br>AI target [for Crafting] (weekly) = Sum (S1 Income (weekly) + S2 Income (weekly) target) [for all S1 and S2]
<br>
<br>This means that when we add-up weekly income generated by sale of goods produced through use of Trade Skills, this total should be more or less the AI target we calculated for Crafting. Through some simple mathematics we can then come to a value for X, which is the only unknown in the equation (Bliz will have access to info on number of characters whose primary activity is crafting, number of characters specialising in each trade skill, average character levels etc).
<br>
<br>Then once X is calculated we go on to calculate how the total income generated by Crafting should be distributed between characters with various skill specialisations, as described in the previous post. X may end up being about 5 gold anyway using this method, this will depend on how much crafting is being done by characters whose primary activity is something other than crafting (flooding the crafted goods market). Remember that characters with Crafting as their “primary activity” will also be taking income from other income pools, e.g. when they quest or do arena battles, so it should even out.

								Dragonsword,
<br>
<br>Your posts seem to depend on NPC vendors, but in an economy with nondegradable items and player crafting, there will be very little interaction with NPC vendors once the server matures.
<br>
<br>Players will buy almost ALL of their goods from other players.
<br>
<br>NPC vendors will be of little value except for beginner players.
<br>
<br>In addition, this leads to NO MONEYSINKS which will lead to the devaluation of currency and the economy will basically thrive as a barter system.
<br>
<br>
<br>There is almost no way to get around this once player made items are introduced and the fact that mob items will be much better than store bought items.
<br>
<br>
<br>The only and i mean only way to get around this would be to FORCE players to INTERACT with NPC vendors by PREVENTING open trade between players and having all goods regulated by game.
<br>IE players must buy all items and sell all items to some NPC vendor.
<br>
<br>However, this limits free market and decreases a players ability to make significant money.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thus, this whole discussion is useless unless one can come up with a way to take money out of the economy cause currently from what we know there will be no way to do that.
<br>
<br>All items appear to be attainable through other players.
<br>
<br>In all likelihood there will be auction houses ala final fantasy where players can easily sell those goods.
<br>
<br>NPC vendors offer nothing.

								Heavenlyrain, how do you know that NPC vendors will offer nothing and that the economy will be a barter system between players?  I fear that you have excluded a very important factor: simple little goods that allow players to craft items (herbs, minerals, etc.)  I have here a very simple counter example to your argument:  Billy is a human mage specializing in alchemy and herbalism.  He needs some herbs to make a potion.  Billy could either look for the herbs himself, buy them from a vendor, or find a player who just happens to have the right amount and right kind of herbs and is willing to either give them, sell them, or trade them to Billy in exchange for something else.  In my opinion, trying to find someone who has the right kind of herbs and is willing to give them to you is too tedious, especially when I could just find them myself or buy them!  So for now, lets temporarily rule out trading for herbs with other players.  Now, lets say that all of the inputs on this server (i.e. total amount of money and total number of players) are fixed.  Most likely, if someone is looking for some herbs they are going to buy them from a vendor.  However, what if it turns out that the demand for herbs is decreasing because players find that the prices are too high and the herb is abundant enough that they can just find it instead?  A simple resolution to this problem would be for Blizzard to lower the price of the desired herb a little bit and make the herb less abundant in the wild.  This would entice players to buy the herbs instead.  This brings me to my next point/suggestion.  I think that along with a fixed amount of gold and number of players per server, the number of items (such as hebrs) should be fixed as well.  For example, lets say that the total number of a particular kind of herb (lets call it herb &quot;x&quot;) is 100,000.  The 100,000 plants of herb &quot;x&quot; must be accounted for in the wild and in the inventories of NPC vendors.  This suggests the simple formula:  HW + HI = TH.
<br>
<br>HW = total herbs in the wild
<br>HI = total herbs in NPC inventories
<br>TH = total herbs on server
<br>
<br>However, since this formula doesn't account for the number of herbs in player inventories, a similar M1, M2, M3 system could be put into place.  Instead of M1 it would be H1 (where H = herbs rather than money).  All in all, the variables might be something like this:
<br>
<br>H4 would be the total amount of herbs
<br>H3 would be the amount of herbs in the wild
<br>H2 would be the amount of herbs in all NPC vendor inventories
<br>H1 would be the amount of herbs in player inventories
<br>
<br>Their relationships are very simplistic and would be as follows:
<br>
<br>H1 + H2 + H3 = H4
<br>H4 - (H2 + H1) = H3
<br>H4 - (H3 + H1) = H2
<br>H4 - H3 - H2 = H1
<br>
<br>I believe that this system would work in combination with price controls on behalf of Blizzard, provided that every input was fixed.  After all, economic models are so much easier and more fun when there are no varying inputs.  It makes equillibrium much easier to achieve and helps eliminate inflation.  Anyways, tell me what you think of this idea.           :D
<br>
<br>P.S. - When it comes to hoarding, I highly doubt that players will hoard herbs unless it is strictly out of spite to other players.  However, if this is the case, GM's will most likely be able to intervene (They could be like the economy police!)
<br>
<br>P.S.S. - Some of you may be asking the question: Where would the herbs go after they have been used by a player?  I think that once an herb has been used it should either go back into the wild or into NPC vendor inventories.  Depending on the number of herbs currently in H3 and the number of herbs in H2, the used herb would go back to the one with the least amount of herbs.  [i.e. A player uses an herb.  The number of herbs in the wild (H3) is less than the number of herbs in NPC vendor inventories (H2).  The herb would then go back into the wild (H3).]  This way there would always be enough herbs to account for H4.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by BananaRebellion ]<br></font></small>

								     This has become my favorite thred on the World of Warcfraft forums.  DragonSword you have a very good scholarship in this subject and have done really well in brining up important factors in MMOG econmy problems.  I think the idea of having player markets where they pay a NPC to sell the goods is a good idea as opposed to a bazaar like EverQuest.  In EverQuest the Introduction of the bazaar caused a massive deflation of item value because it allowed all players in the bazaar to view all of the other prices of the same item and set a lower price causing a consant decrease in prices.  So having a bazaar in this would cause a deflation problem so as I said before a player market where a NPC was payed a few to sell goods would be much better.  Also on JustinJoseph's compiled guild he said that on Zepplins there would be gambling tables not sure if that means gambling against NPCs or other players but it could also be another way for money to get back into the NPC account if NPCs get money out of it.  
<br>     This has been my first post on any forum ever.  Thanks.

								I just thought of another way money could go back into the NPC account; suppose someone had an ability the would acctually take money to use like a spell that used gold as a component of maybe a coin hurl type move.  The money used could go back into the NPC money account.  Not a new idea really in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; made by Nintendo in 1986 when you used an arrow it allways costed one rupie.  Another idea maybe any player who  has more than a certain amount of money stored in the bank the bank chages them interest like .05% for every hour of gameplay; whilst this would not be a very big decrease and many people may regard it as trivial it might give the NPC money account the boost it needs to stay in Sync with the formulas posted by DragonSword and BananaRepuplic.  This second idea makes sense in the way that charging interest for storing large ammounts of money for some seems fair in the real world as in the game world.  Having a set number of gold coins makes sense in that gold is precious because it's a rare element if there were unlimited quantities of it then why is it valuable?

<br>Hi there, I’m checking up on my old WoW Economics post again. So good to see some more intelligent contributions added onto it! Thanks especially for your first ever forum post Arctic Slicer... heh... :D
<br>
<br>I’ve been thinking some more, and I’ve decided to propose that we introduce two new elements to our economic model (still under development). The first is a Treasury, and the second is what I call a Super Macro-Economic Optimiser “O”.
<br>
<br>First the Treasury. This will be a pool of currency that will act as a kind of buffer, to give those in charge of managing the WoW economy a margin for error, and to cover economic cycles and unpredicted events in the WoW world. I propose that the amount of currency in the Treasury be 20% of the gold in the NPC sector. So we now need to introduce M6, which will be M5 plus Treasury. Macroeconomic formulas will be adjusted as follows:
<br>
<br>  M6 target can be one billion gold (or whatever amount Bliz chooses for the server total)
<br>
<br>  M5 target = (M6 – M3) x 80% + M3
<br>
<br>  M4 target = (M6 – M3) x 60% + M3
<br>
<br>  M3 target =  C x L x 100 gold
<br>
<br>    Where C = number of Characters active on the server
<br>    Where L = average Level of all characters on the server
<br>
<br>  M2 target = M3 x 80%
<br>
<br>  M1 target = M3 x 20%
<br>
<br>In WoW there will be some NPCs that take-in money and never need to give out money. They may hold a small amount of gold on them which will drop if they are killed, but they will never buy stuff from players. Examples are Trainers who will exist in all kinds of places around the WoW landscape and who will take in gold in exchange for skills training.
<br>
<br>There will also be NPCs that sell Griffin Rides, Zeppelin Rides, Journeys by Ship, NPCs that collect rent for Player Housing and Guild Headquarter leases, possibly Tattoo services and Hairdressing services and other stuff. I propose that since these NPCs don’t need to hold much gold, their income goes straight to treasury. Gold and item loss penalties from player deaths will also go straight to Treasury. NPCs that buy stuff and sell stuff, on the other hand, will need to hold some amount of gold.
<br>
<br>The amount held by a NPC vendor will be determined by the size of their shop, the range of gear they buy and sell, their location in the world and the amount of player traffic that passes through their shop each week, etc. Each week Treasury will do an automatic clearance of all NPC vendors who hold gold. Those who are holding less than their target amount will receive gold from Treasury, those holding more than their target amount will pass-on the extra to Treasury. Older purchased items held by the vendor will also go to Treasury.
<br>
<br>If a vendor buys heaps of stuff in one week and is running out of gold, then they will automatically offer lower and lower prices when purchasing goods from players, until their (purchase) prices are so low no-one sells to them. This system (aside from working) should add some really useful economic indicators for Bliz. For example if certain vendors are constantly out of gold Bliz can check to see what is happening.
<br>
<br>Is there some resource in that area of the world that is way too easy for players to exploit, making it possible to collect and sell vast quantities to local NPC vendors? If so action can be taken. Or if it’s just that a lot of players are operating in that area at that time for some reason (a quest or guild activity) then maybe the target for gold held by that vendor can be adjusted upwards temporarily.
<br>
<br>Monsters and creeps around the landscape that hold wealth (ready to drop when they are killed) will be supplied with their gold directly from Treasury when they spawn. Gold flowing into and out of Treasury will be monitored, and Bliz will aim to keep these flows in balance so total gold in Treasury remains at about 20% of NPC held wealth. Now remember that the next 20% of NPC wealth will be held in the Strongholds of Key High Ranking NPCs around the world, like Kings and Warlords.
<br>
<br>There will be at least one of these “Key” NPCs living in each major city, and possibly also at other locations around the world (wilderness, dungeons, islands etc.). I therefore propose that when game masters construct quests, they will obtain the gold and items needed for quest rewards from the stronghold of the nearest Key NPC. Treasury will supply gold and rare items to these Key NPC Strongholds each week, and each Stronghold will have a wealth target to be maintained.
<br>
<br>If Treasury finds some Strongholds are emptying out much faster than others and need constant re-supplying they can check why. Are game masters in that part of the world offering too much gold or too many rare items as quest rewards compared to other world locations? If so some game masters will need to be warned to cut back on their wealth distributing activities. There may also be ways for game masters to move wealth from the local economy in their area, to the local Key NPC Stronghold, to even things out.
<br>
<br>
<br>OK enough about Treasury. Now for the Super Macro-Economic Optimiser “O”. You will note that in our macro-economic formulas to-date the relationship between M3 (total wealth in the player economy) and M6 (total currency on the server) is more or less arbitrary, and depends on how many characters are on a server and how much effort they put into levelling-up, stuff that is kind of outside the control of Bliz. So I propose we form a link between M3 and M6 as follows.
<br>
<br>Firstly we replace the 100 gold in the M3 formula with “O”.
<br>
<br>  M3 target =  C x L x O
<br>
<br>    Where C = number of Characters active on the server
<br>    Where L = average Level of all characters on the server
<br>    Where O = super macroeconomic Optimiser
<br>
<br>Now we define O as an amount of currency such that:
<br>
<br>  M6 x SN = Sum (M3st x BT) [for all servers] 
<br>
<br>    Where M6 = the total amount of currency on each WoW server
<br>    Where SN = the total number of WoW servers operating
<br>    Where M3st = the M3 Target for each individual Server
<br>    Where BT = Blizzard [wealth distribution] Target (2) *
<br>
<br>* BT will possibly start at about 20 at game release, and move towards 2 over a period of one year.
<br>
<br>M6 will be assigned by Bliz (known), BT will be assigned by Bliz (known), number of servers will be known, therefore we do some simple substitution and replace M3st with the C x L x O formula. Bliz will obviously know how many Characters are on each server and what their average Level is. So the only unknown is O, which can now be calculated. O may end up being about 100 gold, or some other amount.
<br>
<br>In plain English, what this means is that (assuming BT is 2): on average, across all WoW servers, the target for total gold held by Players will be 50% of the total gold on each server at any point in time. If at game release Bliz sets BT to 20 this will mean that the new (low level) characters flowing into the WoW world will initially only have access to about 5% of total server wealth. As Bliz moves BT from 20 towards 2 over time, they will make it possible for players to get hold of a greater percentage of the wealth on each server.
<br>
<br>The final goal may be for the wealth held by players (on an average server) to be about 50% of the total wealth available (BT = 2). Some servers might have a higher population of characters, and the characters might be (on average) more leveled up, so on those server players might hold 60% of M6. On other servers with a lower, less experienced population players might hold 40% of M6. But across all servers, the Super Macro-Economic Optimiser will ensure that on average players hold about 50% of M6 (or another % if Bliz chooses).
<br>
<br>The beauty of this method is it allows Bliz to directly control “O” through manipulation of BT, and therefore influence the value of the M3 target on every WoW server indirectly. You will note from our macroeconomic formulas above that targets for M1, M2, M4 and M5 are all directly affected by the M3 target, and therefore all monetary targets on all servers will move as a result of movement in the Super Macro-Economic Optimiser. Isn’t that cool? Is there something wrong with me that I actually find this exciting?

								OK I’ve been having fun making up economic formulas for application to the WoW Economy (yes it was fun) and formulating with your help a trial economic model for WoW. Time to take a rest from that and respond to some recent points and criticisms raised by other contributors to this thread.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>
<br>1. Item Decay. This can be implemented many ways - but it's obvious this goes a long way to combat inflation. In EQ2 the first player to make or obtain a drop has no problem - but the item will slowly decay once it is sold to a second owner.
<br>
<br>Exeter Penance
<br>
<br>I think that along with a fixed amount of gold and number of players per server, the number of items (such as herbs) should be fixed as well.

<br>
<br>All right, I admit it, I am a Monetarist! I actually studied Monetary Economics at University. Monetary Economics is a school that focuses on Money Supply above all else. We formulate targets for M1, M2, M3 etc. and develop tools and mechanisms to move currency into (and out of) each of these. We believe that if money supply is handled properly, everything else will kind of take care of itself.
<br>
<br>In the real world I think Monetary Economics is pretty nice, because it is very important to maintain the value of currency and prevent inflation and recession, monitor consumer spending patterns and wealth distribution. However, in the real world its fine if the value of non-currency wealth in the economy (that is &quot;items&quot;) just keeps on increasing. I mean are citizens going to complain if one year they are all riding motor scooters, the next year they are driving hatchbacks, the year after that they are all in Mercedes, etc? No they will love it!
<br>
<br>However in a game world I admit there will be a problem if there are so many good items around that everyone can easily get their hands on the best possible gear for their character. It will take away motivation to buy stuff from NPC vendors, leading to reduced flow of capital from the player economy to the Treasury. It will also detract from the value of performing a variety of activities that have items as their reward (like questing). My previous posts have not ignored this factor, but I focused on money supply first because that is the kind of economist I am. ;P
<br>
<br>So, lets take a closer look at the value of items in the economy. First of all I want to make the point that in WoW every item that exists will have a (hidden) value assigned to it by Bliz. When an item is first introduced into the game world this (hidden) value will be a &quot;rough guess&quot; by Bliz related to how useful the item will be and how badly players will want it. If you want to know the hidden value of an item sell it to a NPC vendor then buy it back. Now add the sale price and the purchase price and divide by 2. This is (roughly) the hidden value, simple.
<br>
<br>Over time Bliz should observe what sort of prices players are paying for this type of item in the player to player market and modify their initial hidden value to reflect real world value. Bliz will also be able to check how fast the item sells from NPC vendor inventories. If the item sells-out in shops really fast it is probably underpriced, if no one buys it then it’s probably overpriced, etc. So, my point is that because of these hidden values Bliz will be able to calculate at any given time the total value of items and equipment on a server.
<br>
<br>I propose we take the approach that value of items and equipment on a server be tied to M6 (amount of currency on the server). Also total value of items held by players should be tied to M3 (the amount of currency held by players). I suggest that if it’s OK for a level 20 character to hold about 2000 gold (including in bank, in house, in guild account) then it should also be fine for that character to have about 8000 gold worth of equipment and items (some worn, some carried, some in storage).
<br>
<br>We can easily produce some formulas backing up this proposition:
<br>
<br>  IET target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 20%
<br>  IEK target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 20%
<br>  IEV target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 20%
<br>  IEC target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 40%
<br>  IES target = (M3 x 4) x 60%
<br>  IEW target = (M3 x 4) x 40%
<br>
<br>    Where IET = total value of Items and Equipment held in Treasury
<br>    Where IEK = total value of Items and Equipment held in the strongholds of Key NPCs (for quest rewards, used by Game Masters etc)
<br>    Where IEV = total value of Items and Equipment held by NPC Vendors in their inventories
<br>    Where IEC = total value of Items and Equipment held or guarded by Creeps, monsters and other NPCs ready to be dropped upon death
<br>    Where IES = total value of Items and Equipment held by players in Storage (in bank deposit boxes, in player housing etc)
<br>    Where IEW = total value of Items and Equipment actually Worn (or carried) by players 
<br>
<br>So, in the above model the total value of items on a server will be held (more or less) constant. This doesn’t mean the server will always contain the same items. It will be up to Treasury to remove items from the game word, introduce items to the game world and adjust (hidden) prices on items and equipment to ensure total item wealth on the server remains close to the target.
<br>
<br>Items will flow to Treasury from purchases by NPC vendors, player death item drop penalties, character deletion (when a character is deleted from a server their items will go to Treasury), item use (drink a potion, eat a chicken, use some iron ore to make a shield, use some magical ingredients to cast a spell, etc.) and possibly also item decay. 
<br>
<br>Items will flow out of Treasury through spawning of creeps and monsters (who hold items ready to drop), distribution of items to the inventories of NPC vendors for sale, distribution of items to Strongholds of Key NPCs for use by Game Masters as quest rewards, gathering of resources from the landscape using neutral skills (herbs, food, wood, jewels, metal) and creation of items through trade skills, item rewards offered for Arena Combat and achievement in PvP Faction War areas, etc.
<br>
<br>So the main problem is to keep the value of items flowing into Treasury roughly equal to the value of items flowing out of Treasury. We already discussed how it would be useful for NPC vendors to hold a certain amount of currency. So it will also be useful for NPC shopkeepers to keep a certain quantity of items in inventory for sale to players. Inventory target levels will be determined by what kind of shop it is, the size and location of the shop, number of players passing through the shop each week etc.
<br>
<br>At the end of each week Treasury should clear all shop inventories across the server, take in any excess stock (resulting from items being purchased from players) and distribute new items to those vendors whose inventories are running low. Again if certain vendors are constantly selling out of certain items Treasury should look into why this is occurring. Are these items seriously underpriced for that part of the world? Or, if there is a good explanation, inventory target levels for the Vendor may need to be adjusted.
<br>
<br>If a NPC vendor finds they are running low on an item they should automatically raise the price for that item until they receive their next shipment from Treasury, and continue raising their price until players stop buying it or they sell out. This will prevent flooding of underpriced items into the game world before Bliz can catch it. 
<br>
<br>Also if Game Masters in some parts of the world are being too generous in distributing items from local Key NPC Strongholds (as rewards for Questing, or Arena Combat, or PvP Faction War achievements etc.) then Treasury will see that refilling those Strongholds each week is becoming too expensive. So they can talk with local GMs about this and take corrective action.
<br>
<br>Still, even with these suggested checks and balances I can see that some posters will still be concerned that flow of items into the game world will outweigh flows out of the game world. 
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>
<br>Eventually, money will be worthless and the economy will be based on a barter system. This is inevitable in a player crafted and treasure hunting economy.
<br>
<br>HeavenlyRain
<br>
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>The point is, if it is possible to get really good stuff through Party Dungeon Questing (or ritual crafting or whatever) then once this equipment is obtained it will never leave the player controlled sector of the economy. Players will just keep it, pass it from character to character and never give it up to a NPC vendor. Player held item wealth (IES + IEW) will then increase over time regardless of what Treasury does, wont it?
<br>
<br>Bliz has already said that rare and unique items will be pretty hard to get hold of in WoW, but even so they will flow into the player economy over time, so how do we get them out again? Item drop penalties for player death are a possibility, but this has not been confirmed and may not be in the game. However there is a concept that will be in the game (confirmed) that relates to this point, and that is Soul Bound Items.
<br>
<br>Really high end items in WoW will be Soul Bound, which means if your character obtains one of these items it will be bound to your character and can’t be exchanged with another character. So if you get tired of the item, or find a better one, or decide to delete your character, your only choice will be to sell the item to a NPC vendor. This comes back to the point of item decay raised by Exeter Penance.
<br>
<br>So, Soul Bound Items will be able to pass from player to player 0 (zero) times before going back to the NPC sector of the economy. Are we then to assume that all other items will be able to pass from player to player [infinity] times before going back to the NPC sector of the economy? I don’t think so. Wouldn’t it be more logical for other items that are rare (but not &quot;Soul Bound&quot;) to also have a limit on number of times they can be exchanged (e.g. 10 times) before going to a NPC Vendor?
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>
<br>The thing is, like in real world economies, only time will tell. There can be a dozen theories thrown about, but again as in life, these are theories, that can only be shown to be true/false through a testing.
<br>
<br>Which is why I think it would be nice if they added this as part of the beta test, with different systems and theories on different servers.
<br>
<br>American_Might
<br>
<br>I think the best thing you can do is make a solid robust model, test it as much as you can in beta (which isn't as much as it'd probably need) and then hope, monitor, and finely tune it as you go.
<br>
<br>JRavey
<br>
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>I agree, all the formulas, theories and models we are throwing around represent only a rough hypothetical model for economic management of the WoW economy. But seriously, Bliz needs to have some kind of economic model or plan to test and refine, through the beta and beyond, if they want the economy of WoW to be successful (or at least more successful than the Diablo economy). I really wonder if Bliz even has anything as advanced as the model that is being formulated through this post at this stage. :P
<br>
<br>I challenge any Blizzard Representative reading this to tell us how far you have got to date with your economic planning. You know what I think would be really helpful at this stage - for people posting to this thread (especially those with lots of online gaming experience) to suggest economic tools and mechanisms Bliz could use to move currency between M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 and move items between IET, IEK, IEV, IEC, IES and IEW. 
<br>
<br>Because having economic targets is not useful unless you have the means to achieve those targets. I’ve already suggested some economic adjustment mechanisms, and so have other posters, but with our combined creativity I’m sure we can come up with heaps more. What do you think?
