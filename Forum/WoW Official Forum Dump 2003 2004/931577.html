								I think fixed amounts are cool too, can't wait for the first person to try to corner the market on something!
<br>
<br>The one problem I see offhand (if I remember reading the fixed input idea from way back when right) is, it favors people that start early vs people that start late, especially with rarer items.
<br>
<br>Now that I think of it, in general that would be the problem with hard (there are 3 doomhammers in the world) or soft (1 doomhammer per 2000 players) solid limits... they favor the people that get there first.
<br>
<br>For GOLD tho, I think a hard limit would be great.  Its super unlikely that anyone could get enough money to put a real dent in the cap, bit it puts a permanent stop in inflation (if all the gold is in circulation its value won't drop too much).  
<br>
<br>edit: Looking back, perhaps using the term 'doomhammer' wasn't wise ;)  /Unique/ items should be pretty unique and super limited, but not much better.  But latecomers need the ability to get top quality goods.  
<br>
<br>Also: thinking a back, a hard limit on rare trade components would only work I think if they're likely to be recycled...  Otherwise you'll end up running out of (say) 'meteoric iron' pretty fast as the game progresses.

								Thanks for the replies.  Anyways, fixed inputs are a great idea, but I do not think that they necessarily favor firstcomers.  If an item is really rare, then there aren't going to be many of those items anyway.  And if an item isn't so rare, there will probably be enough to go around.  Furthermore, if a limit is high enough, people will still have the opportunity to obtain that item no matter how early or late they start the game.  Moreover, not everyone will be the same class, race, or specialize in the same skills, so it isn't very likely for a situation to occur where someone is not being eligible to acquire an item due to how early or late they started the game.
<br>
<br>The whole reason for item limits came about when I first suggested a fixed amount gold on a server and fixed amount of players on a server.  Since gold can take many forms, including items, we would not only have to have a fixed level of gold, but fixed items as well.  This theory then led me to the fixed player idea.  With a fixed amount of players on a server, it would be easier to achieve and maintain equillibrium.  Anyways, back to the discussion at hand.  I suppose I ought to clarify something.  When I say fixed inputs, fixed items, fixed gold, etc., I don't mean small limits here.  I mean limits large enough to accommodate a great many players.  For instance, earlier in this thread I talked about Billy the Mage and how he was making potions.  The potion required a few reagents, one in particular being Silverleaf.  Now, if memory serves, I said the Silverleaf limit on the server was 10,000.  Aw heck, forget this, I'm going to compile some of posts on fixed inputs, including Bill the Mage!  I'll post back soon!
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

								In this post (and some of the ones following this one) you will find a compilation of some of my posts regarding fixed inputs.  However, keep in mind that I)ragonSword came up with many interesting ideas concerning the M1, M2, M3 system.  We sort of used both of our theories and worked from there.  There were also many others who contributed during this time, one in particular is Arctic_Slicer.  Anyways, here goes nothing!  Wait, why don't I just put some of I)ragonSword's posts as well?  It will make it easier to understand!  (P.S. - BR = BananaRebellion and DS = I)ragonSword).
<br>
<br>BR - First post on fixed inputs:
<br>
<br>l)ragonSword, do you think having a fixed amount of gold per server could help solve any problems? Lets say that a particular server has, to pick an arbitrary number, 1,000,000,000,000 gold on it. This would mean that no more than one trillion gold can be found on that server. This one trillion gold has to be accounted for in both the amount of money all the players on a given server possess and the total amount that is in the economy (shops and every single creep camp on the entire world) Since the amount of money would be fixed, Blizzard could then use some form of price control to bring the economy into equillibrium. For instance, lets say that Blizzard finds that on one server there is a surplus of a certain kind of item(s), or not a lot of people are spending money. Blizzard could then lower prices (which would include cost of items, skill trainers, and money gained by creeping) to entice people to buy more and put money back into the economy so that other players can gain it some way (creeping, selling items, etc.) and spend it again. Also, if there was a shortage of a certain kind of item(s), or too many people were spending money, Blizzard could raise prices to prevent this mass spending. When it comes to people or guilds hoarding money, Blizzard could probably give GM's the ability to send thieves to steal money and put it back into the economy (kind of like Robin Hood - steal from the rich and give to the needy) I believe that having a constant amount of money per server will make it easier for Blizzard to control the economy and make sure gold doesn't become too scarce and valuable, or too abundant and worthless. 
<br>
<br>P.S. - A formula to describe the conditions in which the economy would be in equillibrium would be: Amount of gold all players possess (including money in banks) = Amount of gold all shops and creep camps possess 
<br>As money flows into the economy (shops, trainers, etc.) via players spending or trading, money flows back to the players via creep camps, selling items, trading. This keeps it all in balance in combination with Blizzard's price controls.
<br>
<br>DS - M1, M2, M3:
<br>
<br>“Do you think having a fixed amount of gold per server could help solve any problems?” 
<br>
<br>Yes maybe so, I’ve been thinking about this. The funny thing about money supply is its not as easy to define as you might think. In the real world economists recognise that there are a number of measurements of “supply of money” in an economy, all of which are useful. For example M1 might be money held in cash, M2 might be M1 plus money held in savings accounts, M3 might be M2 plus money held in term deposits and investment accounts, etc. 
<br>
<br>As you go up to M4 and beyond money becomes less “liquid”, less free to be exchanged and flow through the economy. So to manage the economy a government will always have an M1 target, an M2 target, an M3 target etc. each of which needs to be monitored and fine-tuned through economic management. So, in the WoW economy I guess M1 will be gold actually held by characters, ready to spend. M2 will be M1 plus gold deposited in player bank accounts. 
<br>
<br>M3 might be M2 plus gold held in chests and boxes in guild headquarters and player housing. M4 might be M3 plus gold held by monsters, shopkeepers and NPC characters below a certain rank. M5 might be M4 plus gold reserves held by the highest ranking NPCs like Kings, Warlords and Dragons. So Bliz could have a target for M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 and each of these targets could be monitored and adjusted. 
<br>
<br>So by your suggestion to keep the total gold on the server “fixed” we are actually talking about fixing M5. This still leaves Bliz free to encourage movement of currency between M1, M2, M3 and M4 to manage inflation and unemployment. Now I really like it that you have suggested an economic formula, because economists love formulas. So I’m going to suggest some of my own formulas for the WoW economy... 
<br>
<br>
<br>M5 target can be one billion gold (or whatever amount Bliz chooses for the server total) 
<br>
<br>M4 target = (M5 – M3) x 80% + M3 
<br>
<br>M3 target = C x L x 100 gold 
<br>
<br>Where C = number of Characters active on the server 
<br>Where L = average Level of all characters on the server 
<br>
<br>M2 target = M3 x 80% 
<br>
<br>M1 target = M3 x 20% 
<br>
<br>
<br>To put the above into words, this means keep the total gold on the server fixed, let players have some part of that total based on how many characters there are on the server and what levels they are, and the rest is kept by NPCs. The top level NPCs will have 20% of total NPC wealth, the rest will be distributed among shopkeepers, monsters, will be guarded by creeps and NPC gangs etc. Then of the wealth that is held by players, make sure not more that 20% of it is hoarded in chests in guild headquarters and player housing, and not more than 60% of it is saved in the bank. 
<br>
<br>BR - Second Post fixed inputs:
<br>
<br>Heavenlyrain, how do you know that NPC vendors will offer nothing and that the economy will be a barter system between players? I fear that you have excluded a very important factor: simple little goods that allow players to craft items (herbs, minerals, etc.) I have here a very simple counter example to your argument: Billy is a human mage specializing in alchemy and herbalism. He needs some herbs to make a potion. Billy could either look for the herbs himself, buy them from a vendor, or find a player who just happens to have the right amount and right kind of herbs and is willing to either give them, sell them, or trade them to Billy in exchange for something else. In my opinion, trying to find someone who has the right kind of herbs and is willing to give them to you is too tedious, especially when I could just find them myself or buy them! So for now, lets temporarily rule out trading for herbs with other players. Now, lets say that all of the inputs on this server (i.e. total amount of money and total number of players) are fixed. Most likely, if someone is looking for some herbs they are going to buy them from a vendor. However, what if it turns out that the demand for herbs is decreasing because players find that the prices are too high and the herb is abundant enough that they can just find it instead? A simple resolution to this problem would be for Blizzard to lower the price of the desired herb a little bit and make the herb less abundant in the wild. This would entice players to buy the herbs instead. This brings me to my next point/suggestion. I think that along with a fixed amount of gold and number of players per server, the number of items (such as hebrs) should be fixed as well. For example, lets say that the total number of a particular kind of herb (lets call it herb &quot;x&quot;) is 100,000. The 100,000 plants of herb &quot;x&quot; must be accounted for in the wild and in the inventories of NPC vendors. This suggests the simple formula: HW + HI = TH. 
<br>
<br>HW = total herbs in the wild 
<br>HI = total herbs in NPC inventories 
<br>TH = total herbs on server 
<br>
<br>However, since this formula doesn't account for the number of herbs in player inventories, a similar M1, M2, M3 system could be put into place. Instead of M1 it would be H1 (where H = herbs rather than money). All in all, the variables might be something like this: 
<br>
<br>H4 would be the total amount of herbs 
<br>H3 would be the amount of herbs in the wild 
<br>H2 would be the amount of herbs in all NPC vendor inventories 
<br>H1 would be the amount of herbs in player inventories 
<br>
<br>Their relationships are very simplistic and would be as follows: 
<br>
<br>H1 + H2 + H3 = H4 
<br>H4 - (H2 + H1) = H3 
<br>H4 - (H3 + H1) = H2 
<br>H4 - H3 - H2 = H1 
<br>
<br>I believe that this system would work in combination with price controls on behalf of Blizzard, provided that every input was fixed. After all, economic models are so much easier and more fun when there are no varying inputs. It makes equillibrium much easier to achieve and helps eliminate inflation. Anyways, tell me what you think of this idea. :D 
<br>
<br>P.S. - When it comes to hoarding, I highly doubt that players will hoard herbs unless it is strictly out of spite to other players. However, if this is the case, GM's will most likely be able to intervene (They could be like the economy police!) 
<br>
<br>P.S.S. - Some of you may be asking the question: Where would the herbs go after they have been used by a player? I think that once an herb has been used it should either go back into the wild or into NPC vendor inventories. Depending on the number of herbs currently in H3 and the number of herbs in H2, the used herb would go back to the one with the least amount of herbs. [i.e. A player uses an herb. The number of herbs in the wild (H3) is less than the number of herbs in NPC vendor inventories (H2). The herb would then go back into the wild (H3).] This way there would always be enough herbs to account for H4.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by BananaRebellion ]<br></font></small>

								DS - Items and Equipment:
<br>
<br>OK I’ve been having fun making up economic formulas for application to the WoW Economy (yes it was fun) and formulating with your help a trial economic model for WoW. Time to take a rest from that and respond to some recent points and criticisms raised by other contributors to this thread. 
<br>
<br>Q u o t e:
<br>
<br>
<br>1. Item Decay. This can be implemented many ways - but it's obvious this goes a long way to combat inflation. In EQ2 the first player to make or obtain a drop has no problem - but the item will slowly decay once it is sold to a second owner. 
<br>
<br>Exeter Penance 
<br>
<br>I think that along with a fixed amount of gold and number of players per server, the number of items (such as herbs) should be fixed as well. 
<br>
<br>Banana Rebellion 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>All right, I admit it, I am a Monetarist! I actually studied Monetary Economics at University. Monetary Economics is a school that focuses on Money Supply above all else. We formulate targets for M1, M2, M3 etc. and develop tools and mechanisms to move currency into (and out of) each of these. We believe that if money supply is handled properly, everything else will kind of take care of itself. 
<br>
<br>In the real world I think Monetary Economics is pretty nice, because it is very important to maintain the value of currency and prevent inflation and recession, monitor consumer spending patterns and wealth distribution. However, in the real world its fine if the value of non-currency wealth in the economy (that is &quot;items&quot;) just keeps on increasing. I mean are citizens going to complain if one year they are all riding motor scooters, the next year they are driving hatchbacks, the year after that they are all in Mercedes, etc? No they will love it! 
<br>
<br>However in a game world I admit there will be a problem if there are so many good items around that everyone can easily get their hands on the best possible gear for their character. It will take away motivation to buy stuff from NPC vendors, leading to reduced flow of capital from the player economy to the Treasury. It will also detract from the value of performing a variety of activities that have items as their reward (like questing). My previous posts have not ignored this factor, but I focused on money supply first because that is the kind of economist I am. ;P 
<br>
<br>So, lets take a closer look at the value of items in the economy. First of all I want to make the point that in WoW every item that exists will have a (hidden) value assigned to it by Bliz. When an item is first introduced into the game world this (hidden) value will be a &quot;rough guess&quot; by Bliz related to how useful the item will be and how badly players will want it. If you want to know the hidden value of an item sell it to a NPC vendor then buy it back. Now add the sale price and the purchase price and divide by 2. This is (roughly) the hidden value, simple. 
<br>
<br>Over time Bliz should observe what sort of prices players are paying for this type of item in the player to player market and modify their initial hidden value to reflect real world value. Bliz will also be able to check how fast the item sells from NPC vendor inventories. If the item sells-out in shops really fast it is probably underpriced, if no one buys it then it’s probably overpriced, etc. So, my point is that because of these hidden values Bliz will be able to calculate at any given time the total value of items and equipment on a server. 
<br>
<br>I propose we take the approach that value of items and equipment on a server be tied to M6 (amount of currency on the server). Also total value of items held by players should be tied to M3 (the amount of currency held by players). I suggest that if it’s OK for a level 20 character to hold about 2000 gold (including in bank, in house, in guild account) then it should also be fine for that character to have about 8000 gold worth of equipment and items (some worn, some carried, some in storage). 
<br>
<br>We can easily produce some formulas backing up this proposition: 
<br>
<br>IET target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 20% 
<br>IEK target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 20% 
<br>IEV target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 20% 
<br>IEC target = ((M6 – M3) x 4) x 40% 
<br>IES target = (M3 x 4) x 60% 
<br>IEW target = (M3 x 4) x 40% 
<br>
<br>Where IET = total value of Items and Equipment held in Treasury 
<br>Where IEK = total value of Items and Equipment held in the strongholds of Key NPCs (for quest rewards, used by Game Masters etc) 
<br>Where IEV = total value of Items and Equipment held by NPC Vendors in their inventories 
<br>Where IEC = total value of Items and Equipment held or guarded by Creeps, monsters and other NPCs ready to be dropped upon death 
<br>Where IES = total value of Items and Equipment held by players in Storage (in bank deposit boxes, in player housing etc) 
<br>Where IEW = total value of Items and Equipment actually Worn (or carried) by players 
<br>
<br>So, in the above model the total value of items on a server will be held (more or less) constant. This doesn’t mean the server will always contain the same items. It will be up to Treasury to remove items from the game word, introduce items to the game world and adjust (hidden) prices on items and equipment to ensure total item wealth on the server remains close to the target. 
<br>
<br>Items will flow to Treasury from purchases by NPC vendors, player death item drop penalties, character deletion (when a character is deleted from a server their items will go to Treasury), item use (drink a potion, eat a chicken, use some iron ore to make a shield, use some magical ingredients to cast a spell, etc.) and possibly also item decay. 
<br>
<br>Items will flow out of Treasury through spawning of creeps and monsters (who hold items ready to drop), distribution of items to the inventories of NPC vendors for sale, distribution of items to Strongholds of Key NPCs for use by Game Masters as quest rewards, gathering of resources from the landscape using neutral skills (herbs, food, wood, jewels, metal) and creation of items through trade skills, item rewards offered for Arena Combat and achievement in PvP Faction War areas, etc. 
<br>
<br>So the main problem is to keep the value of items flowing into Treasury roughly equal to the value of items flowing out of Treasury. We already discussed how it would be useful for NPC vendors to hold a certain amount of currency. So it will also be useful for NPC shopkeepers to keep a certain quantity of items in inventory for sale to players. Inventory target levels will be determined by what kind of shop it is, the size and location of the shop, number of players passing through the shop each week etc. 
<br>
<br>At the end of each week Treasury should clear all shop inventories across the server, take in any excess stock (resulting from items being purchased from players) and distribute new items to those vendors whose inventories are running low. Again if certain vendors are constantly selling out of certain items Treasury should look into why this is occurring. Are these items seriously underpriced for that part of the world? Or, if there is a good explanation, inventory target levels for the Vendor may need to be adjusted. 
<br>
<br>If a NPC vendor finds they are running low on an item they should automatically raise the price for that item until they receive their next shipment from Treasury, and continue raising their price until players stop buying it or they sell out. This will prevent flooding of underpriced items into the game world before Bliz can catch it. 
<br>
<br>Also if Game Masters in some parts of the world are being too generous in distributing items from local Key NPC Strongholds (as rewards for Questing, or Arena Combat, or PvP Faction War achievements etc.) then Treasury will see that refilling those Strongholds each week is becoming too expensive. So they can talk with local GMs about this and take corrective action. 
<br>
<br>Still, even with these suggested checks and balances I can see that some posters will still be concerned that flow of items into the game world will outweigh flows out of the game world. 
<br>
<br>Q u o t e:
<br>
<br>
<br>Eventually, money will be worthless and the economy will be based on a barter system. This is inevitable in a player crafted and treasure hunting economy. 
<br>
<br>HeavenlyRain 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The point is, if it is possible to get really good stuff through Party Dungeon Questing (or ritual crafting or whatever) then once this equipment is obtained it will never leave the player controlled sector of the economy. Players will just keep it, pass it from character to character and never give it up to a NPC vendor. Player held item wealth (IES + IEW) will then increase over time regardless of what Treasury does, wont it? 
<br>
<br>Bliz has already said that rare and unique items will be pretty hard to get hold of in WoW, but even so they will flow into the player economy over time, so how do we get them out again? Item drop penalties for player death are a possibility, but this has not been confirmed and may not be in the game. However there is a concept that will be in the game (confirmed) that relates to this point, and that is Soul Bound Items. 
<br>
<br>Really high end items in WoW will be Soul Bound, which means if your character obtains one of these items it will be bound to your character and can’t be exchanged with another character. So if you get tired of the item, or find a better one, or decide to delete your character, your only choice will be to sell the item to a NPC vendor. This comes back to the point of item decay raised by Exeter Penance. 
<br>
<br>So, Soul Bound Items will be able to pass from player to player 0 (zero) times before going back to the NPC sector of the economy. Are we then to assume that all other items will be able to pass from player to player [infinity] times before going back to the NPC sector of the economy? I don’t think so. Wouldn’t it be more logical for other items that are rare (but not &quot;Soul Bound&quot;) to also have a limit on number of times they can be exchanged (e.g. 10 times) before going to a NPC Vendor? 
<br>
<br>Q u o t e:
<br>
<br>
<br>The thing is, like in real world economies, only time will tell. There can be a dozen theories thrown about, but again as in life, these are theories, that can only be shown to be true/false through a testing. 
<br>
<br>Which is why I think it would be nice if they added this as part of the beta test, with different systems and theories on different servers. 
<br>
<br>American_Might 
<br>
<br>I think the best thing you can do is make a solid robust model, test it as much as you can in beta (which isn't as much as it'd probably need) and then hope, monitor, and finely tune it as you go. 
<br>
<br>JRavey 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>I agree, all the formulas, theories and models we are throwing around represent only a rough hypothetical model for economic management of the WoW economy. But seriously, Bliz needs to have some kind of economic model or plan to test and refine, through the beta and beyond, if they want the economy of WoW to be successful (or at least more successful than the Diablo economy). I really wonder if Bliz even has anything as advanced as the model that is being formulated through this post at this stage. :P 
<br>
<br>I challenge any Blizzard Representative reading this to tell us how far you have got to date with your economic planning. You know what I think would be really helpful at this stage - for people posting to this thread (especially those with lots of online gaming experience) to suggest economic tools and mechanisms Bliz could use to move currency between M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 and move items between IET, IEK, IEV, IEC, IES and IEW. 
<br>
<br>Because having economic targets is not useful unless you have the means to achieve those targets. I’ve already suggested some economic adjustment mechanisms, and so have other posters, but with our combined creativity I’m sure we can come up with heaps more. What do you think?

								BR - Third Post Billy the Mage:
<br>
<br>Hmmm. I see your point about crafted items Artic_Slicer, but I feel that having a total amount of crafted items is inevitable. However, I think I have a really good solution that would make it so that a player would never run into that issue you described earlier while keeping the total number of gold constant and accounted for. Let's say that there are a total of one million different recipies for every kind of equipment. (when I say equipment I mean every kind player crafted item be it a sword, potion, etc.) This means that the total number of different recipies that can be found by a player, regardless of what kind of item it will make, is one million. Now, have you ever heard of the substition property in math? (If A=B then B can be substituted for A in a formula) This property could be applied to help keep inputs fixed and the number of gold constant even with crafted items. Here's how: 
<br>
<br>An Elixir of Lion's Strength requires one snakeroot, one silverleaf, and one empty vial. Now, lets say that the total value of all of these ingredients is 25 gold. This means that the final product, the Elixir of Lion's Strength, would have to be worth 25 gold. A simple formula could be: VTI = VFCI 
<br>
<br>Value of total ingredients = Value of final crafted item 
<br>
<br>Furthermore, this new Elixir would have the snakeroot, silverleaf, and vial in it (in it meaning Elixir of Lion's Strength = one snakeroot, one silverleaf, one vial) at all times until the potion was consumed or sold to an NPC vendor. If the potion was to be used or sold, all of the ingredients would go back into the environment or into NPC vendor inventories, depending on whose stock is lower at the time. So, temporarily, as long as one Elixir of Lion's Strength is in existence, then one snakeroot, one silverleaf, and one vial do not exist. Well, they do exist, but they are just in a new form, the Elixir. Furthermore, the money value of these ingreidents is still there and accounted for but is just taking a new form as well. 
<br>
<br>Now, let me simplify this and show you my point: 
<br>
<br>Total silverleaf plants on server: 10,000 
<br>Total silverleaf plants in wild: 5,000 
<br>Total silverleaf plants in NPC vendor inventories: 5,000 
<br>Total silverleaf plants in player inventories: 0 
<br>Total silverleaf plants in crafted items: 0 
<br>
<br>Total snakeroot plants on server: 10,000 
<br>Total snakeroot plants in wild: 5,000 
<br>Total snakeroot plants in NPC vendor inventories: 5,000

<br>Total snakeroot plants in crafted items: 0 
<br>
<br>Total vials on server: 10,000 
<br>Total vials in wild: 0(you buy vials, not find them in the wild) 
<br>Total vials in NPC vendor inventories: 10,000 
<br>Total vials in player inventories: 0 
<br>Total vials in crafted items: 0 
<br>
<br>(Now, let's say that Billy the Mage collects the ingredients necessary for Elixir of Lion's Strength) 
<br>
<br>One silverleaf + One snakeroot + One vial = One Elixir of Lion's Strength 
<br>
<br>Total silverleaf plants on server: 10,000 
<br>Total silverleaf plants in wild: 4,999 
<br>Total silverleaf plants in NPC vendor inventories: 5,000

<br>Value of vials in player inventories: 0 gold 
<br>Value of vials in crafted items: 5 gold 
<br>Value of one vial: 5 gold 
<br>
<br>(Now, Billy sells/uses the Elixir) 
<br>
<br>Total value of all silverleaf plants: 100,000 gold 
<br>Value of silverleaf plants in wild: 50,000 gold 
<br>Value of silverleaf plants in NPC vendor inventories: 50,000 gold 
<br>Value of silverleaf plants in player inventories: 0 gold 
<br>Value of silverleaf plants in crafted items: 0 gold 
<br>Value of one silverleaf plant: 10 gold 
<br>
<br>Total value of all snakeroot plants: 100,000 gold 
<br>Value of snakeroot plants in wild: 50,000 gold 
<br>Value of snakeroot plants in NPC vendor inventories: 50,000 gold 
<br>Value of snakeroot plants in player inventories: 0 gold 
<br>Value of snakeroot plants in crafted items: 0 gold 
<br>Value of one snakeroot plant: 10 gold 
<br>
<br>Total value of all vials: 100,000 gold 
<br>Value of vials in wild: 0 gold 
<br>Value of vials in NPC vendor inventories: 100,000 gold 
<br>Value of vials in player inventories: 0 gold 
<br>Value of vials in crafted items: 0 gold 
<br>Value of one vial: 5 gold 
<br>
<br>[note, this does not include possible items drops from creeps] 
<br>
<br>Now, the value of one Eilixir of Lion's Strength would be 25 gold. 
<br>
<br>Value of one silverleaf + Value of one snakeroot + Value of one vial = Value of one Elixir of Lion's Strength 
<br>
<br>10 gold + 10 gold + 5 gold = 25 gold 
<br>
<br>Phew, now that has been said, I will tell you my next point. Arctic_Slicer identified the possible problem of limited crafted items. This would certainly stink if you couldn't make the sword that you wanted to because the max amount has already been reached. So, the solution is as follows: Make it so that every player on a given server may have a quantity of a particular item that is proportional to the rarity, strength and level of the item and the ingredients necessary to craft that item. For example. the total amount of level 100 Psycho Doom Swords per player would be extremely low compared to the amount of level 1 Noob Potions per player. To be specific, there may end up being some items that are only one per server, others that are limited to one per every 10 players, some that are one per player, or some items so common that they are like 20 per player. Since the kind of items you can craft depends on your proficiency level, what kind of skill you specialize in, your class, and what kind of recipies you have, the odds of high level players not being able to craft a powerful item is very unlikely. 
<br>
<br>Ok, I know this post was kind of long, but I would like to hear if you guys have any comments, questions, suggestions, or new ideas. Post back when you can. :D

<br>Q u o t e:
<br>
<br>do you think that there should be a total amount of all kinds of items as well as just a total amount of gold and players? If all of the inputs in the economy are fixed, then would you not agree that equillibrium could be reached simply by adjusting prices and the kind of items dropped by creeps? 
<br>
<br>BananaRebellion 
<br>
<br>Oh my god, I thought I had a problem making my forum posts too long, you put me to shame! :D I read through your all your points and arguments though, nice one. Billy the Mage sure is a busy fellow. About fixing the number of each item type on a server, Bliz could do this if they wanted to, and actually they have indicated that there will be fixed numbers of some high-end items like rare or unique “soul bound” weapons and armour. 
<br>
<br>For more common items however, like food and potions and low quality equipment, I was thinking that Bliz might like to allow for a fair amount of fluctuation in item quantities. So if a lot of players all decide to be sword fighters they can all go out and get nice swords, or if players decide they love eating apple pies they can gather apples, make heaps of them and eat them, or if players on a server decide they love killing snow trolls then they can go troll hunting and obtain large quantities of the types of items dropped by trolls, etc. 
<br>
<br>Also from time to time Bliz might like to introduce completely new items onto servers, and remove large quantities of older items that players are getting bored with (this would be done through Treasury). I thought the more important thing would be to try to keep the total value of items on each server close to a particular target, and also the total value of items held by players close to a particular target (IES + IEW). This would allow for consumer trends in WoW, so that certain items might become popular for a period of time, and then players would get tired of these items and hand them over to NPC vendors (to be removed to treasury). 
<br>
<br>Q u o t e:
<br>
<br>So, temporarily, as long as one Elixir of Lion's Strength is in existence, then one snakeroot, one silverleaf, and one vial do not exist. Well, they do exist, but they are just in a new form, the Elixir. Furthermore, the money value of these ingreidents is still there and accounted for but is just taking a new form as well. 
<br>
<br>BananaRebellion 
<br>
<br>I think that when a player crafts an item the ingredients used to craft the item should go to treasury at the time of crafting, and the finished item should be pulled from treasury at the same time and put into the game world. This way treasury will have constant information about quantities of ingredients being used in crafting and the quantity and value of items being crafted by players on a server. This information should be very useful in economic planning. 
<br>
<br>However, should a crafted item have a hidden value equal to the hidden value of all ingredients used in the crafting? To actually craft an item will require collecting and combining the right quantities of ingredients with the use of a recipe and will take time and possibly a crafting facility or building (e.g. use of a blacksmith building to craft armour). Recipes will also require time and effort to get, and some recipes may only be obtained through difficult quests. 
<br>
<br>So if a finished product has the same value as its ingredients, what is the motivation to craft it? Why not just sell the raw ingredients to a vendor for the same price and save a lot of trouble? This is why I would expect crafted items to actually be worth more than their base ingredients. Of course I don’t know if it will be like this, the game hasn’t even gone Beta yet so who knows what Bliz is up to with their economic planning.. :D 
<br>
<br>By the way, I have thought of a way to encourage movement of wealth from M3 and M2 to M1. That is, to encourage players to hold less gold in chests and in the bank and carry more gold in character inventory. Of course the amount of gold held in character inventory will depend partly on how much gold monsters drop when killed, as this gold will need to be carried back to town and will therefore be in inventory for a while. However, Bliz will want to use monster kill drops mainly as a tool to adjust movement of wealth from Treasury to Players (that is from M6 to M3). 
<br>
<br>So, to encourage movement from M3 and M2 to M1 I suggest we look at items and services available for purchase outside of towns and cities. Firstly let’s assume that if you buy something from a vendor in town you can either deduct the purchase price directly from your bank balance, or you can make a withdrawal from the nearest branch then walk over and make the purchase. These types of purchases don’t encourage you to hold gold in inventory once you leave town, they encourage you to use wealth that is already banked. 
<br>
<br>However, if (as Bliz has hinted) there will be services and equipment available for purchase outside of towns (and away from banks), then the more valuable the out-of-town equipment and services are the more gold players are going to want to carry in case they are given the opportunity to make such a purchase far from any bank. For example, it seems likely that there will be trainers who live in the wilderness and offer special skills training to players who seek them out and can afford the training fees. 
<br>
<br>By encouraging players in this way to carry currency around (instead of banking it all) Bliz should be able to stimulate spending in the WoW economy. Because as everyone knows, money in your wallet is much more likely to be spent than money in the bank or money that is invested. Encouraging players to carry currency around will also stimulate player-to-player trade outside of towns and cities, as players will be able to buy stuff from each other without travelling to the nearest bank. 
<br>
<br>Also this way players will have gold in their inventory ready to drop (and presumably go back to treasury) if they are killed, presuming there will be gold loss death penalties. By the way, did you guys see the latest tradeskills addition to the WoW homepage? It says &quot;all of these abilities fall under the heading of tradeskills, and specializing in certain disciplines by selecting and perfecting them could allow your character to seize an important role in the dynamic economy of the world.&quot; Just what we’ve been talking about for the last month. :P

								Actually I went over alot of the thread the other day.  Yeah That was definatly one of the most defining sections of this thread.  In that week I think we had more progress made than the whole 2 months this thread has existed.  Well one day short of two months. 
<br>
<br>Also One of the recent posters said something about consignment.  This seems like a good idea in some ways but I don't think it would work well with a person trying to get the prices they want for the set items.  There probabally is a way for it to work though.

								Yea,  I agree Arctic_Slicer, those were some really good posts, and we did make a ton of progress during that week!  However, there is a very tiny point that I just wanted to bring up.  It was in I)ragonSword's last post above.
<br>
<br>So if a finished product has the same value as its ingredients, what is the motivation to craft it? Why not just sell the raw ingredients to a vendor for the same price and save a lot of trouble? This is why I would expect crafted items to actually be worth more than their base ingredients. Of course I don’t know if it will be like this, the game hasn’t even gone Beta yet so who knows what Bliz is up to with their economic planning.. :D     -I)ragonSword
<br>
<br>I)ragonSword, there is still motivation in crafting, because the final porduct will be better than gold becuase of the item's effects.  For instance, you could sell all of the ingredients or the final product and make some money, but you couldn't use that money to go slay an ogre.  If you used the ingredients to craft a sword, even though it is worth the same, you could kill that creep that you have been meaning to do.  Anyways, that's all I wanted to say about that.  I don't really want to start a discussion about it since it will interfere with the fixed inputs discussion!  :D  IoI  Post back when you can, I need some more responses so we can have a good conversation.

								About the limits thing, the main concern in all this is in the endgame anyways.  MOST of the MMO economies out there hold on pretty well until people  start maxing out their characters and don't need to upgrade.
<br>
<br>The problem is that later in the game, good items, money, et cetera tend to accumulate in the hands of the players that are at the top.  And unlike the real world, there don't need to be effective money sinks.  What I'm thinking right now is, despite the idea of adjusting costs, et cetera, we just change our problems.  
<br>
<br>Now instead of the top players ammasing totally obscene wealth and wrecking the economy, you are limiting their income some, but not addressing that they can gain wealth comparatively faster than lower level people.  
<br>
<br>I'm not (unlike at least 3 of you people :p) a real studen of economic theory, but explain to me how just limiting the wealth supply will fix the endgame problem?  Because the higher level people can make more money compared to the low level people, hard limite in the end hurt the low levels more than the high levels.
<br>
<br>I can already see you saying, &quot;Well, when the top level people have too much money/too many items, those drops are specifically slowed down/stopped.&quot;  This might work to a certain degree, and almost totally with the gold. With items, however, you're asking for trouble if the drop rate gets too low.  
<br>
<br>Remember we're dealing with a human community playing a game they've paid for.  Whats Blizzard gonna say when they complain &quot;Why are we being punished for being good at YOUR game and playing alot?&quot;  It would be extremely hard for the company not to fold to that.  I'll admit that all of the theories here come down to punishing those folks, but reducing item drops/money drops is VERY obvious, and is gonna make people very angry.  (and believe me that segment of the playing population is extremely vocal).
<br>
<br>I guess this comes back around to effective money sinks again, tho (funny how you go full circle :))
<br>
<br>
<br>P.S. I'm not trying to be a naysayer, (I seem to post objections alot) so sorry :(
<br>
<br>P.P.S.  And yeah I read all that stuff.

								Thanks for the reply Windie!  You've got some good points, but nothing that I can't handle.  :D  IoI  I'll try my best to answer your questions and to solve some potential problems.
<br>
<br>The first problem that you brought up is about high level players amassing all of the wealth.  My response is this:  I do not think that high level characters will possess all of the wealth.  It will still be distributed evenly amongst everyone on the server.  In a fixed input economy, the Treasury possesses every cent of currency and every single item when the server first starts out.  This includes all crafted items, ingredients, quest items, creep drops, gold, all noobie items, all intermediate items, and all leet items.  Since everything has to be accounted for in the Player side and the Treasury, the maximum limits are always accounted for, but in different forms and places.  As the economy gets going, let's say beginning as the very first creep falls to the ground, gold and items are gained from creep drops and quests.  More and more people join the server, more and more quests are accepted, more gold and items start to flow from Treasury to Players and back again.  Meanwhile, the initial players are leveling up and maturing.  They then lose the need for their initial equipment and begin to gain more advanced gear.  (Now this transition is seamless and occurs gradually, not all at once.)  As the more experienced players drop or sell their gear, it goes back into the Treasury where the new players that join the server pick it up, use it, and then in turn pass it on to the new players as they advance.  This cycle keeps on going, and going, and going.  However, one might ask:  What happens when there are no new players starting out?  The answer is like this, for one that most likely won't happen.  People will continue to try new characters and races and keep on playing from the start.  Although, there will be a point where the server gets very mature and a majority of the characters are very high levels.  At this point in the economy, the little items aren't being traded around as much as the more &quot;leet&quot; ones.  So, let's say that there are a certain number of very advanced players who have some really good gear and and lots of cash.  So what?  I really don't see the problem here.  I don't think it is possible for a bunch of high level characters to wreck the economy.  There are a couple of reasons why I say this.  One, is storage capabilities.  People will only be able to store so many items.  Plus, if high level people have lots of cash, then there should be some really extravagent activities that they can participate in.  These activities would have a certain level requirement and cost a lot of gold.  I)ragonSword mentioned this earlier in this thread, he thought of the idea of &quot;Luxury Cruises&quot;.  Now, the whole idea of Luxury Cruises isn't necessarily a boat ride (although it could be), so much as a big money sink.  High level players could spend their money on one of these events, and have a real good time.  This would be a good way to get money back into the Treasury.  However, Blizzard did mention that they will be constantly adding new things to the game and that they will always be putting out stuff for the more advanced players to do.  To be perfectly honest, I don't think that there will be a problem with too many high level characters.  Especially since storage is limited and gold appears as if it will be something hard to come by in WoW.  Also, is it a big deal if advanced players have really good gear?  Will that even effect the low level players?  I don't think so.  I could be wrong, but I think it has no impact on newbie players whatsoever.  Another thing is the race/class factor.  Not everyone is the same race or class, nor does he or she specialize in the same skills.  Therefore, the odds of some player not getting a desired item are slim.  Plus, many characters will be doing a lot of crafting and trading, plus they will be gaining lots of quest specific gear.  So to answer your question, high level players will never have their incomes halted.  They will always have new, exciting things to do since Blizzard will be providing new stuff!  And also, the limits and maximums that we are talking about here aren't tiny.  They probably aren't even noticable by players.  In fact, the main reason we have them is so Blizzard can see where all the wealth is and more effectively achieve equillibrium and prevent inflation.  (Of course some price controls would be necessary as well and some tweaking of other little inputs.)  Finally, a fixed input economy works the best when all of the items and cash are flowing and are in both the Treasury and Player side of the economy.
<br>
<br>Phew, I know that was a big long rambling thing, but I hope I answered your questions Windie.  Please respond if you have any comments or further questions!  I would like to hear everyones feedback!  Thanks.   :D
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>Have a nice day.

								I wish I could find the other post now where people went into this more (it was the other LOOOONG economic post, which appears to have rolled off of the forums now :( )
<br>
<br>I hear what you're saying and you're right, I totally withdraw the comment about it hurting the low level players ;)
<br>
<br>The other idea of my objection tho (stolen from Tehsuq, thx sir!) is that when people get to max level (and blizzard says 3-4 months for that) they'll quickly get to the point where they have the BEST of each kind of equipment.  At this point, they either sell all the loot they get, save it for twinking, or trash it.  The bag thing helps with twinking for sure, and price adjustments will help with income from selling and supplies (altho supplies aren't REALLY necessary by most accounts).  When you get to a point where costs are effectively zero and income is fairly steady you're going to have inflation. (even if vendor prices for the drop items are going down player prices will probably always be pretty good, if they aren't good at all, you're still getting overpowered items dumped constantly into the economy).  Thats the problem with max level characters.
<br>
<br>And I'll admit a good number of people will go on cruises, buy houses, do whatever, (I sure would if I ever got there :p)  But theres that terrible core in every game of people who just don't, and it doesn't take many to start really harming things.  
<br>
<br>In summation, maybe I'm just being to cynical about how the players are gonna react, aaand (looking back at my ramblings) the the fixed input would certainly help things alot (you were right :p) But the 'endgame' problem is still really real :)

<br>
<br>No matter how many cool things they put into the endgame to spend money on, there will ALWAYS be the gold hoarders.  These dragons in player-form will without mercy suck up all the wealth on the entire server, then sleep on it.  
<br>
<br>In any tightly controlled economy there will always be the one kid who thinks it's cool he has absolutely all the gold on his server.  So I am saying for the sake of truly new people that come into a mature server that the new stuff be immune to increases or decreases based on the current treasury formulas.
<br>
<br>As far as consignment on existing NPC merchants Artic, I think it would be easier for a programmer to implement a new feature to an existing NPC (and save worldspace by doing so) than to create totally new sellers completely under the PC's control.  I do like the idea of personal merchants, but I think it should be an endgame purchase, and having existing NPCs able to consign items for you would allow all levels to sell without having to yell on a chat channel all day.
<br>
<br>And I am all for not having people yell on chat channels…

								Consignment is great and all but I really don't see how that will actually get your goods sold.  In EverQuest it wasn't impossible to find really good items on regular vendors because someone sold it to them.  Usually though the price was more than they were willing to pay so it just disapeared when the next patch came.  The biggest possible problem I see with the consignment merchant is that many people will not use them will instead go about shouting out their wares; which as you said did not want.
<br>
<br>According to TehSuq's GenCon report the representative said that money sinks are a neccasary evil.  Having a number like  1,000,000,000,000 gold coins on a server at start should be more than plenty to keep a few people from hoarding gold.  If it turns out that there is not enough gold to go around they could raise the ammount of gold on the server.  If there is too much they can lower the ammount of gold on the server.  Also higher level characters will be able to get money easier than lower level characters but will also be spending more money as well.  If there are enough things that a player may find worth while to put their money into it is unlikely that a player could hoard all of the money.  Also a player will probabally have to be able to sell stuff while they are hunting or offline to be able to get large ammounts of money.  With consignment merchants or personal vendors a person will be paying them money on a regular basis to keep shop.  Money will always be flowing out of the economy.  There will likely be an expansion after a year or so.  This expansion will likely introduce new things to spend money on so the people who have hoarded money will be the first to give it all up.  Keep in mind I really don't like item standard changing with each expansion.  I was thinking more on the lines of new minigames or having a fee to go to certain places.  Of course the simpilist soulution is to limit the total ammount of money a person can carry and store in the bank.  1,000,000 sounds like  a reasonable limit.  
<br>
<br>Anyway these are my thought about these subjects.  I will post again later.

								Ha, you beat me to it Arctic!  That was the next thing that I was going to suggest!  Simply put a limit on how much cash any given individual can hold.  The limit should be high enough that the only people who would notice it are money hoarders.  Otherwise, normal players would never know that this limit is in place.  I think it would work.  It's a very simple but effective solution.
<br>
<br>P.S. - Plus, no one would be able to whine if Blizzard made the limit high enough.  Meaning players will never need more than the maximum amount of gold simply becuase there wouldn't be enough for them to spend it on.  So, all Blizzard would have to do is find the right limits on all of the inputs (including gold, items, players, ingredients, etc.) and everything would work out ok.  Of course, if Blizzard needed to, they could adjust the limits on particular items as they see fit as the game goes on.
<br>
<br>P.P.S. - Tell me what you think!

								That was something that was actually cool about AC1.  you had a definite hard limit on the currency you could carry.  (Due to encumberance but still)
<br>
<br>An idea about that, they could make there be a max # of units of currency per stack, so you have to balance cash on hand vs bag capacity :)  (you could do this in the bank too, if you wanted)
<br>
<br>Seems like a pretty integrated way to do it, if making inventory management harder...
