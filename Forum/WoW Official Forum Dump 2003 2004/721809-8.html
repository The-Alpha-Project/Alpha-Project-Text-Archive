								After reading the posts in this thread (in which my head was swimming in equations), I came to realize... you guys have way to much time on your hands. But alas, you are right in your calculations. However, you have overlooked a few things. One such thing is that as an Multiplayer Online Game, you cannot have limiations, nor can you have a system that is mainly based on one particular economic solution.
<br>
<br>I would like to propose my own view to look at. It's not an monetary equation, but more of an observation on how the economy would operate in a typical fashion. Yes, I know there will be several people who will disagree with what I am about to write.
<br>
<br>First off, take off the ideas of a Treasury, a limited number of items, etc.
<br>Money and items (equipment, quest items, other loot) are not limited in how much can exist at one exact time. The number of items on a particular server can be endless. That gets rid of the worries of someone cornering a particular market based on particular item.
<br>Next, lets look at vendors. Vendors themselves have the ability to sell a pre-generated list of items. This list cannot change, and will contain some form of normal items that are used by players as equipment or consumed itesms. Thus you have one vendor who would sell swords as his pre-generated list type, and another who would sell gems as his pre-generated list type. Next, add in the ability for each vendor to accept (buy) items from players. When the vendor buys this item, it is added to another list on the vendor, we will call it the Temporary Stock. It is called temporary because each time the server is reset or brought down for maintainance, all information about this stock is reduced to zero (which effectively takes out items in the economy). Now the key thing about vendors is that they sell low-grade items in terms of equipment (the more valuable armors and weapons would be obtained through other means), however, they would be the primary source of various other necessities. This could come in the guise of BASE items required for tradeskills (such as a vial, a spit, a flask, or a bowl) or the guise of REAGENTS (in which are instantly consumed when the spell is successfully cast). Add to the fact that there would be different types of consumables (you would have higher grade/quality items for higher skills and spells) and that you would need to buy some of these in bulk. Since these items would mainly be supplied by vendors, it would make these items extremely hard to find in other means. However, what about the other items, such as armor and weapons (and various other equipment).
<br>Well, these items would serve as the basis of the player-run portion of the economy. Lets start off be adding the fact that not all creatures will drop some type of loot. Thus, there is already an edge on the amount of items coming into the world (as opposed to a game like Diablo 2). Next, lets add the fact that there will not always be items useful to a particular character, and not everyone will horde items just to sell them to another player. So many of those items would go to vendors (into their Temporary Stock) while provide the player with meager cash (adding a miniscule portion of money into the economy). However, some creatures will drop weapons or armor. Depending on the quality of the said armor or weapons (which can range from store-bought, sub-store-bought, and above store-bought) would determine the economic value to players. A low grade items that is less in effectiveness than, say, the lowest sword availible in the vendor's inventory would automatically be considered as vendor loot (in which the player sells, adding to the Temporary Stock again, and recieves a small portion of money) or intended to rot on the corpse of the monster. The average weapons could be looted and sold as well, but they would most likely stay on a corpse to rot as well. While the above standard items (mainly the magical ones and player-created items) would have a different role.
<br>The key thing to realize in a player-run system is that not everything is desireable. There are some things people want more than others. That is also limited to what people can afford. I will set up an example.
<br>
<br>There are four total players:
<br>Bob, who is selling a Keen Longsword (he is asking for 100 gold).
<br>John, who is looking to buy a better sword (but only has 75 gold), but has an Enhanced Club (which he wants to sell for 25 gold).
<br>Jane, who has 25 gold and wants to buy a better weapon.
<br>Davis, who has a Shortsword of Might and a Keen Dagger (which he is selling for 75 gold and 15 gold, respectively). However, he has 150 gold in his pocket, and himself is looking for a better weapon.
<br>
<br>Bob auctions off his sword for 100 gold. John, being the first to see that Bob is selling a weapon he wants realizes he only has 75 gold, but if he sells his club, he can get the sword. So he auctions off his club. About this time, Jane comes up and sees that John is selling his club (a better weapon than the one she has currently), however, she doesn't want a blunt weapon (either by choice, or by class restriction, etc.). However, Davis shows up and see's Bob's auction and buys the sword. Davis buys the sword, and puts up his newly-replaced sword for sale. John sees this new sword up for sale and sees that it is 75 gold, the same amount that he has, so John goes to buy that sword instead. However, he wants to buy a meal or two for health, so he still wants to sell his club. Davis, seeing as he had no trouble selling his current item, decides to sell the dagger he had in his backpack. Jane sees the dagger, which she can use, and chooses to buy it. Everyone, except John, is satisfied with their transactions and they decide to leave. However, John realizes after awhile that his club isn't selling, so he decides to leave.
<br>
<br>So, in the end results:
<br>Bob sold his sword and made 100 gold.
<br>John didn't sell his club, but still bought a sword that he could use, even though it isn't what he wanted.
<br>Jane bought her new dagger, and still has 10 gold that she can spend or save up.
<br>Davis, being the excellent businessman he is, sold both of his weapons, and obtained a new weapon, and has 140 gold.
<br>
<br>What does this prove? Player economies are set up in a way that not everything will be dependent on the most typical item that everyone will want, especially at one time. However, this line of thinking changes when we stop focusing on a small player group, and look at a larger player group.
<br>
<br>Lets say a particular monster drops two weapons: a Longsword of Swift Justice, and a Dagger of Maiming. The items that drops from this weapon do not both drop at the same time, and in all factuallity, the Longsword of Swift Justice is a fairly rare item that drops. Say, his chances of dropping the item are 1 in 100. However, the Dagger of Maiming drops 74 of those 99 times that Longsword does not drop, and there are 25 kills in which nothing drops at all. To top it off, the chances of the weapon dropping reset each time the monster respawns. This is where we enter a state of over-supply and demand.
<br>It seems that the Longsword of Swift Justice is all the rage, and that many people want one. So, people start killing the monsters that are supposed to drop them. In the begininng, the Longsword of Swift Justice already will cost a large ammount. Lets say 500 gold. The Dagger of Maiming, which isn't that bad a weapon itself, opens the market price around 300 gold. Now, it may not be on the same level as the sword, but a lot of people are buying the dagger. As a result that the dagger is wanted and fairly easy to obtain, the dagger's price will actually go UP. However, as time goes on, more and more daggers are entering the equation. Eventually, the market for the dagger goes down. So, we start seeing the price of the dagger dropping to as low as 50 gold.
<br>But, what about the Sword? Well, lets say that there are 6000 people playing on one server, and that 3000 of them are wanting the Longsword of Maiming. However, at the current rate that they appear in the economy, they are quite rare. So, while the dagger is lowering in price, the sword itself is raising in price, not solely because people are wanting to make a profit, but because the rate of the sword entering the economy is so stagnant, that the player demand forces the price up. It's reasons like this that make a player economy hard, but viable (and this example holds true to many real-world applications, but not for the length of period in a game).
<br>However, the key to all of it, is that while some items are more desired than others, not all of them are going to be predominate than the others. There are exceptions to this.
<br>What is an exception? Well, lets take an example from Everquest. The majority of all higher-end items are generally no-drop. What does this do to the high-end items that are not no-drop? Their price increases in range because their are a desired commodity in he community that are viable sources of equipment.
<br>
<br>Now, this system is not without it's flaws. In fact, my arguement is not as strong as the ones from American_Might or the rest. The idea of having a limitless economy is hard to work around, but the idea is to curb it from going out of hand. However, this is a system that has proven to work, as strange as it might sound.
<br>In any place, you will have those people who hoard cash and items. And while that might seem like a viable option to compensate for the imbalance, that compensation is an imbalance in itself. Not because it balances everything, but because it is limiting what people can do. And it makes it easier for someone to corner a market.
<br>
<br>If you find anything in my post that doesn't make sense to you, just ask and I will try to clarify it.

								Wow, ton of great posts, guys. I'm impressed with the understanding of economics most of you have shown. One major thing I believe you are all overlooking is the danger of controlled cash and item flows within a game. Let's take a look at the successes and failures of games like DAoC that have fairly dynamic currency systems combined with restriction of currency generation. First, setting any specific amount of gold for one NPC is a good way to guarantee that NPC, and likely the village/outpost/town he is located in will become obsolete as times passes. The sheer amount of gold the average merchant in a city like Camelot in DAoC dishes out in terms of loot bought from characters each day is staggering. Likewise, the only merchants who receive siginificant amounts of gold daily are those who sell specific supplies, especially crafting supplies. The basis of the fairly successful DAoC carfting economy is the fact that crafting is a staggering expense. To increase my characters crafting level to it's highest possible status, I relied not only on my own quests for coin, but also on the collective work of my entire guild, many of whom had higher level characters and spent quite a large amount of time either adventuring for gold to give me or plying their own crafts to generate funds for the guild. What matters is not the total amount of gold within a server, but rather the amount of money burned by players creating and using items. To successfully create an economy that won't become flooded by currency, all that is required is creation of somewhat necessary sources of money burn. Horse and griffon rides, rent, reagents and ingredients in recipes, etc... money burn off associated with any given item being tied to the generation of that item and the item's power level. Creating a mighty sword might require considerable investment by a smith. The smith invests 500 &quot;gold&quot; as well as several hours of his time questing for ultra rare ingredients. When he completes the sword he sells it for 700 &quot;gold&quot; to a warrior who has generated money by both crafting lesser items and adventuring. Only the gold wich was gained specifically by the warrior from adventuring has been added to the economy. At the same time the 500 gold worth of ingredients has been burned off by giving it to an NPC vendor. 
<br>    The problem with comparing games like Diablo with an MMORPG is that Diablo IS NOT an MMORPG. It's a multiplayer online game, yes, however the lack of a constant world in which the players interact change the nature of the economy dramatically. At any given time in Diablo there could be 25,000+ people doing Pindleskin runs to generate gobs of ultra high level items. A similar creature in WoW will only be campable by a small group, probably no more than the amount of people in one adventuring group. This limits the influx of gold from that creature into each server. Because players are unable to then leave that server and take their items/currency to another server, farming a specific creature becomes vastly less viable as a source of currency/item generation. In that sense Diablo and Diablo II are so unlike an MMORPG that their economies cannot be used as a viable economic model when being compared to MMORPG economies.
<br>   By severely restricting influx of currency/items into a server, Blizzard can avoid almost all of your proposed concerns without any of the vaunted formulae you've used. An economy in which only adventurers partake and in which the number of different goods being sold is miniscule by comparison to a real world economy is almost laughably simplistic. The only concern for Blizzard is to create viable sources of money burn off, as mentioned above, so that the amount of gold in the player economy doesn't become ridiculous.
<br>   As for sources of money burn other than NPC bought gear, potions, etc..consider player vanity as well as advanced item decay. The beauty of games like DAoC is that, although my gear is probably the best I can get for my character as his level, it is also player made and player spellcrafted. It also decays. So every month or so I am commissioning and replacing one or two parts of my gear. I'm able to maintain the level of use because there are a number of powerful spellcrafters on my server who can easily enchant the exact same thing I had before. The difference, of course, is that I am always using a portion of my money to buy new equipment. Say I pay 500 &quot;gold&quot; for an armband. After several months that armband decays from constant repair and abuse (damn trolls drooling on my armor again...). I pay another 500 gold to get the same gear back. So I go to my friend the crafter and his partner the spellcrafter. I give them the gold and they make my armband. The crafter pays 150 gold in materials, or spends gold on adventuring to get the materials, and receives 200 of the 500 gold. Next, the spellcrafter spends 250 gold on materials, and receives 300 of the 500 gold. So now both the crafter and spell crafter are 50 gold richer. I am 500 gold poorer. The net loss of 400 gold within the PLAYER economy has gone to materials, or the cost of griffin rides, healing potions, and repair of gear incurred by the crafters in their quests to gain materials in order to craft for me.
<br>  So simply by adventuring for loot I cause a certain amount of gold to be burned off of the economy, because the cost of adventuring includes not only NPC direct costs such as griffin rides, any kind of ressurection sickness type healing, and basic repairs if i can't do that myself, but also NPC indirect costs because the people who I need to craft my gear have to burn their own gold to craft/adventure. In the long run the cost of item decay burns off a massive amount of gold. There is no need to keep a specific amount of gold with NPCs because they are not, in truth, part of the economy, and to add to it, if they run out of gold, and their surrounding merchants run out of gold, their locales become obsolete and less player populated. This creates a whole slew of problems for players and Blizzard alike.
<br>  Now for item limits. As it has been pointed out, item limits would encourage hoarding and monopolistic prices. Imagine, not only will people be selling Gold on ebay, but basic reagents for healing potions. If a single powerful guild decides to do so, its members could easily concentrate on cornering the market of one reagent from nearly every recipe in the game. Imagine, several years into the game, your character no longer being playable because the prestigous guild on your server has nearly wiped out the availability of a large number of important ingredients and will only sell them to certain people or for outrageous prices. In this item caps become very dangerous. At the same time limiting player inventories or the amount of a specific item a player can have will lead not only to lag caused by constant logging of mules and mains, but also to an economy in which player run stores and consignment merchants become difficult to produce. Limiting palyer inventory in games like Diablo, where infinite instancing means sickening masses of items per player, is perfectly logical. In smaller worlds where instancing is rare, such as an MMORPG server, it just creates muling and other such annoyances and leads to less flavor for people who want to role play a merchant. 
<br>  Well, it looks like my post has gotten ridiculously long. I'll post more later, let me know what you all think.

								A lot has happenend on this thread since last I posted so I am going to backtrack to rewards recieved for quests.  This idea has somewhat relates to my last post as well as the idea of life quests.  Suppose there are some quests that take a bit of extra effort and time to complete.  The rewards for these quests will be greater than the usual quests.  Suppose the reward for the quests is an item that cannot be transfered; I don't exactly like nontranferable items as I feel they take away from the roleplay value of the game but they do help with economic balancing.  The reward could possibly also be permanent to stat increase, skill up, or maybe a new ability.  rewards such as these have no economic value but are better than the usual cash or item.  This is just and idea that only includes a small percentage of quests and doesn't solve the economic problems of much more common quests.  Now moving to more recent topics on this thread
<br>
<br>The recent posts on this thread seem to be ingnorant of what I believe to be the most important part of a successful economy.  Having a set number of coin and or items prevents them from losing value.  In EverQuest they introduced a feature in a zone called &quot;The Bazaar&quot; that allowed all players in that zone to sell items at what ever prices they chose as well as view what items other people where selling and the price they were asking.  This makes it easy to find the item you are looking for as well as compare prices.  This allowed players who were selling items to set their price lower than all other players who were selling the same item.  This doesn't affect rare items too as they were usually priced much higher than most people could afford.  I once bought a Shard of Night for my Shadow Knight for 7000 platnium pieces a few months later I could buy the same dagger for 3500 platnium peices.  This is an amizing rate of economic deflation which is contrary to our goal.  
<br>
<br>When the idea of item decay was first proposed I thought it was a good idea to create yet another way to make people spend their money.  After thinking about it for awhile I realized how tedious that it would be and way Blizzard Entertainment opts not to have it.  Item decay does a great job on keeping the economy stable in a controlled character only economy.  As the average level of controlled characters becomes higher the controlled character economy becomes more and more likely to becoming victim of being raped by significant inflations or deflations.  With DragonSword's Equation System and the idea of treasury the economy is controlled equally by all characters controlled and uncontrolled.  As cash continues to flow through all of the different DragonSword Equation System the ammount of cash will deviate somewhat from the numeric targets.  When this deviation is noticed a few changes can be made to how money transfers between the different values to get them back on target.  With DragonSword's Equation System, the treasury, and the constant additions of new ideas from erudite minds we can become ever closer to a stable economy.
<br>
<br>Epifany:
<br>
<br>All characters controlled and uncontrolled have equal importance within a stable economy.

								Some would argue that a 'stable economy' is an oxymoron.
<br>
<br>Even in real life, economy is not stable, or should I say, could never be stable. We see the same aspects that happen in the terms of Everquest happen in every day life, just at a lower scale.
<br>
<br>I'm not saying that you do not bring up a few valid points. You do. I'm just saying that the stable economy you are envisioning won't be able to be maintainable at the rate you are figuring.
<br>
<br>Something such as item desirability can quickly throw off the balance of such vision. Yes, there are ways to combat this, but there is so much you can do before you mess something becoming a free market and a sanctioned trade.
<br>
<br>Edit:
<br>The issue on the bazaar function in Everquest is a prime example of bad mechanics in a game. The ability to set up a shop like you could in the bazaar was just asking for ecnomical problems. In fact, most games that I have played that had systems of player run shops, have poor economies. The Everquest economy was better run when it was based on a true person-to-person system, and not 500 people selling stuff at one time.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Pexx ]<br></font></small>

								Hmmm.  I'm sort of at a loss of words here.  But I do think that a lot of the ideas mentioned above have already been taken into account and incorporated in some very complex systems to make sure things were balanced and people couldn't hoard money or items.  Also, I think that I)ragonSword's nice formulas, M1, M2, M3 system, and treasury ideas were awesome and would work.  I can't really think of much else to say.  I)ragonSword, what do you think?<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by BananaRebellion ]<br></font></small>

								I dont know if this fits in with the rest of the posts, but I would like to thrown in an example of how not limiting certain items can severely screw up a game.
<br>
<br>In star-wars: galaxies, the lootable item &quot;Holocrons&quot; were introduced, and these were there to help players get a &quot;jedi&quot; character. The holocrons were lootable from a few specific MOBs, and the drop rate was quite low, but still after a day or two at it, you could have a few of them.
<br>
<br>Since killing the creatures that had theese holocrons, was not at all impossible, but required a quite good combat level, very many fighter types, would constantly hunt common spawn places and really farm holocrons of creatures. 
<br>
<br>Eventually as some people figured out the best way of killing the holocron dropping creautres, they dedicated all their ingame time to get hold of these, and made it very hard for others to get holocrons. 
<br>
<br>Now crafters offcourse have no chance of killing one of these, so all they could do was buy them, and as some players got more advanced, they almost totally controlled the holocron market, and the price that people payed for them went about 300% up in a few weeks. 
<br>
<br>This made some VERY rich, for just standing in the same place killing semi-high leveled creatures.
<br>
<br>Now this example from SWG could certainly be relevant to quest rewards and rare drops in WoW.
<br>It is important that blizzard make sure that very high-demand quest items can only be recieved once. This would make hoarding impossible, and it wouldnt make the economy unbalanced by letting a few individuals make crazy money for something not that hard (the hard part would be to outdamage the others after holocrons to get the loot).
<br>
<br>Anyuways, what the implementing of these holocrons did to SWG, was that prices of everytihng rocketed sky-high. Because now a few people could pay very much for a good weapon, so crafters would imidiately adjust to this and raise prices on good weapons. This led to only very rich people beeing able to get hold of above average weapons, just because they were the only ones who could outbid eachother into infinity.
<br>
<br>Now making certain quest rewards one-time only avaliable, and making them non-tradable, would certainly help to keep economy balanced. But the problem of keeping certain creature spawns constantly camped because of good loot, still remains. Camping in a certain place could still allow you too get extreamely rich. Only by making it pointless to camp spots would hoarding certain creature spawns stop. But how can you do that?
<br>
<br>I hope this example from SWG can help blizzard make sure that economy does not get unbalanced just from adding one lootable item to the game, And also hinder spawn/quest hoarding. And im sry if I didnt stick to the current topic :)<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by h3nkoS ]<br></font></small>

<br>Ummm. Actually, according to Blizzard, quests that have special quest item rewards cannont be done again once they have been completed. However, there are some minor quests that can be repeated such as delivering mail to an NPC or gathering materials for a blacksmith. These quests only give rewards such as gold or little &quot;ingredient items&quot; (herbs, metals, potions, etc.) So, I think that wraps up this little discussion about quests. :D 
<br>
<br>BananaRebellion
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>Yea, actually I realised this when I made my last post, and later on I thought maybe I should have made my point clearer. What I meant when I said most quests would be “repeatable” is that they would be offered again and again, not to the same character but to lots of different characters passing through the same town. One character wont be able to do a quest more than once, but many different characters can take on the same quest and thereby the quest rewards will be claimed multiple times.
<br>
<br>So if a particular quest or group of quests are emptying out a NPC stronghold too fast, they may be cancelled in that they are no longer offered, but can still be completed by players with the quest in their log. On the other hand there will be minor quests known as “tasks” that can be completed multiple times by the same character. Also, since Bliz has announced that some items will be completely unique (one per server) I think there will be super rare epic quests that can only be performed once by one player (or party of players) and are not repeatable in any sense.
<br>
<br>On the point of what happens if a Key NPC Stronghold actually runs dry, quests out of that stronghold have been cancelled but some players still have them in their quest log. First of all think about what this would imply in the game world. According to our model the Key NPC Strongholds will together hold more than 10% of the total currency wealth and item wealth on the server, depending on how far we are from game release (operation of optimiser “O” etc). 
<br>
<br>If one of these Strongholds completely empties, this means the GMs in that area have managed to increase the item wealth AND currency wealth held by players in that area by more than 20% in just one week through quest rewards alone. If this actually happens and some quests are still being completed, I see quest rewards still being handed out and the stronghold automatically taking out an emergency loan from Treasury. However, I also see Treasury management staff coming down on the local Game Masters like a ton of bricks “WTF have you guys done???!!!”.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>Lets just hope that major exploits that exist in these games get stomped out. Namely credit duping, gold duping, item duping, what ever you want to call it. 
<br>
<br>If for some reason a gold duping exploit exists, it better get fixed real quick or any hope of any kind of economy is ruined.
<br>
<br>ZDan
<br>
<br>In response to ZDan, I wouldn't worry about item duping or gold duping etc. In a MMORPG all your character information is stored on Blizzard's server farm, not on your computer. Essentially this is why Diablo is easy to hack into, where as WoW will be MUCH harder. Also since it is all server side it is almost impossible to do it without Blizzard knowing. I know all you hackers are gonna say it is easy, but that is just not the case.
<br>
<br>Bannas
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>Yea, I hope you are right on this Bannas. It has to be acknowledged that one of the main reasons the Diablo economy crashed was from the introduction of vast quantities of super hacked items, and the sale and trade of these items on servers. You could call this the “Black Economy” just like real life societies have a black economy made up of activities such as sale of illegal goods, avoidance of taxes and counterfeiting of currency.
<br>
<br>The recent “Rust Storm” patch for Diablo was actually an effort by Bliz to take control of the black economy in Diablo and wipe hacked items out of the game. It will be interesting to see if a black economy (or hacking economy) makes its way into WoW, and if it does how Bliz handles it. Like you I hope that the combination of storage of character information server side, and the connection of your character to your monthly account will make it much more difficult to hack and get away with it.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>The idea of having a limitless economy is hard to work around, but the idea is to curb it from going out of hand. However, this is a system that has proven to work, as strange as it might sound. In any place, you will have those people who hoard cash and items. And while that might seem like a viable option to compensate for the imbalance, that compensation is an imbalance in itself. Not because it balances everything, but because it is limiting what people can do. And it makes it easier for someone to corner a market.
<br>
<br>Pexx
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>Yea, this reminds me a bit of the Keynesian economics “helicopter” theory. The theory is, if the economy is performing sluggishly and you want to stimulate it, why not just fill up a helicopter (or in our case a gyrocopter) with cash, fly it over cities and throw money out? Yay, all those players down there will be so happy and can buy stuff, and the economy will start moving again! (By the way this is a real economic theory, I’m not making it up).
<br>
<br>Lets just have limitless amounts of cash and items flowing all over the place, and you can get whatever you want. Lets not worry about inflation and massive hoarding of items and currency by players and guilds and boring stuff like that. So what if most characters on a server have everything they want already, and have no motivation at all to seek quest rewards or PvP combat rewards. So what if Game Masters have to offer more and more incredible loot just to get players to accept and perform quests.
<br>
<br>So what if all characters are carrying so much magic stuff their actual stats are almost irrelevant. So what if newly created characters are so weak compared to established characters of a similar level (with super items) that they stand no chance in any sort of combat. So what if you can get hold of the resources necessary to learn all possible skills for your character in a matter of a couple of weeks. So what if the only worthwhile activity left in the game world is camping uber mob spawns to get level-ups.
<br>
<br>Yea, you could take that approach to the game economy of WoW if you wanted to, sure. I mean the game would probably suck, but you could do it. But thankfully Bliz has already stated clearly that they intend to manage the WoW economy very carefully and not let it get out of control like this. Thankfully they are already talking in terms of loot pools and soul bound items and limited storage space and who knows what other economic tools to keep things under control.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>By severely restricting influx of currency/items into a server, Blizzard can avoid almost all of your proposed concerns without any of the vaunted formulae you've used. An economy in which only adventurers partake and in which the number of different goods being sold is miniscule by comparison to a real world economy is almost laughably simplistic. The only concern for Blizzard is to create viable sources of money burn off, as mentioned above, so that the amount of gold in the player economy doesn't become ridiculous.
<br>
<br>Seawulf7
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>If managing an MMORPG economy is so laughably simplistic, why is it that other companies that have released MMORPGs in the recent past have put a LOT of effort into formulating economic management tools and theories, and still failed in many key areas? Have you seen the posts by players of competing MMORPGs complaining about economic mismanagement in those games? I personally think the economic formulas and models discussed so far in this post are if anything too simplistic to work perfectly, and would need a lot of filling out before application to WoW.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>Limiting palyer inventory in games like Diablo, where infinite instancing means sickening masses of items per player, is perfectly logical. In smaller worlds where instancing is rare, such as an MMORPG server, it just creates muling and other such annoyances and leads to less flavor for people who want to role play a merchant. 
<br>Well, it looks like my post has gotten ridiculously long. I'll post more later, let me know what you all think.
<br>
<br>Seawulf7
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>The thing is, we already know that Bliz intends to force high end items out of circulation in the player economy by making them “Soul Bound” (and possibly also putting limits on number of player to player exchanges for items slightly less rare than soul bound items). So now we need a way to make sure there are not infinite quantities of low end items building up in the player economy.
<br>
<br>Limiting storage space per character, combined with ensuring that NPC vendors pay fair prices for items sold by players, could be a perfect way to accomplish this. The info released by Bliz so far suggests that storage space will be limited, and to make the most of your storage space it will be a good idea to get your hands on high quality “bags” that can hold a lot of items. Good bags will be damn expensive in WoW.
<br>
<br>There is the possibility that you will be able to rent extra storage space at the bank, or rent player housing with some storage space included, and guilds may be able to rent guild halls and store items inside. However in all these examples you are paying an ongoing fee for the extra space, so you won’t want to fill it up with low end items anyway. Number of characters per account will be limited to 8 or 10, so creating “mule” characters won’t be an option.
<br>
<br>This seems like an acceptable solution to me. No need for crazy inflation of average item properties and mob power over time to encourage players to give up old less powerful items. You can only store so much stuff, so you will store your best stuff and sell the low quality stuff. But the really good stuff will have player to player exchange limitations, so when you get tired of it it will go back to the NPC sector anyway.
<br>
<br>The other option is item decay so that as lower quality items get used they “wear out” and eventually break or become worthless. Even if you can pay to get lower quality gear repaired, the “maximum properties” of the gear should still fall over time with use, so you can never repair gear back to its original condition. High quality “Soul Bound” gear probably wouldn’t decay in this way. This would also work as a mechanism for getting items out of the player economy, but Bliz has already said they don’t like it because it detracts too much from the fun of the game.
<br>
<br>So, if you want to be a merchant get yourself some good bags, and possibly some extra bank storage space or a personal house, and make sure you sell enough stuff each month to cover the ongoing rental of your player housing or whatever. Should be fine. :D

								Stable economy does have oxymoron properties; the goal of this thread is to find ways to get around that so that economy stays at the greatest possible stability so that it doesn't hinder gameplay.  If it's impossible to get money it's not fun.  If it's too easy to get money then what's the point of having money?  I believe that with the ideas that have been presented in this thread will do very well in maintaining economic balance.  As we get more information on World of Warcraft and the economy we will be able to gather new ideas and adjust our solutions accordinly.

<br>With most threads on these forums it is possible to give good comments from reading the initial post.  This thread is unlike most threads and needs to be read in it's entirety.  This is an idea thread that has a change of thesis with every new post.  A is unable to know the location of our conversation unless they have taken the time to read this length thread.  This thread is now 8 pages with 149 posts a person would have to spend hours to read it all and most people simply do not have the time to spend reading forum threads.

<br>Stable economy does have oxymoron properties; the goal of this thread is to find ways to get around that so that economy stays at the greatest possible stability so that it doesn't hinder gameplay. If it's impossible to get money it's not fun. If it's too easy to get money then what's the point of having money? I believe that with the ideas that have been presented in this thread will do very well in maintaining economic balance. As we get more information on World of Warcraft and the economy we will be able to gather new ideas and adjust our solutions accordinly.

<br>Yea exactly Arctic. I mean talking about game economics might sound pretty boring, and some people will say why bother thinking about the economics of the game so much? We just want to play and have battles and collect stuff and make stuff and go on quests, all this economics stuff is just irrelevant.
<br>
<br>The thing is, the economic management tools and economic models will work in the background of the world, you wont see them. An Ice Troll will never say &quot;sorry, I'm not going to drop much loot when you kill me because I am waiting for my loot pool to be refreshed from treasury&quot;. The point of these models is to keep the game world working properly without players even realising it.
<br>
<br>You might think a game works just fine without any economic planning, but if you actually spend some time playing a MMORPG where the economy is broken you will probably change your mind soon enough. Besides, I ask you, how many other posts are there on this forum that are actually interesting, intelligent and worth contributing to anyway? :)

<br>Heh, yea that's true. It's kind of a dilemma, we want to attract new input into our model but when new posters come in they can't bring themselves to read all the previously posted stuff. Frustrating but kind of funny. :D

								One of the biggest reasons I hardly ever play EverQuest anymore is the broken economy the other reason is the newbizing of game mechanics to attract new players.  The game lost it's ooooo and aaaaa.  The number of threads really worth contributing to and I acctually contribute to are very different numbers.  I have posted on dozens of threads because I like to give comments if I have something I would like to say even if I think the original idea of the thread was a complete waste.  The number of actually intellegent threads I have seen is maybe about a half dozen.

								Wow!  Amazing posts I)ragonSword!  I agree with all that you said.  And yes, it is funny how this thread has become so long and so complex.  :D  Anyways, on a more serious topic, I think I may have an idea to help fix the quest problem and help prevent the GMs from getting a concussion from the Treasury Management Staff.  :D  Now, this may sound sort of outrageous, but what if every NPC that offered a non-repeatable quest had enough rewards for every player on the server.  Even though it is unlikely, but if it just so happened that every single player embarked on the same quest, there would be an item reward for each of them.  Now, this is not including the major quests that can only be done by one person or party only once that will have a very rare item as a reward.  This idea was simply talking about quests that have really noobie rewards, if you know what I mean.  Now, let's say that NPC's who offer quests with rarer rewards than newbie items will have a number of items and quests to dish out proportional to the reward's value.  This way, even if the NPC has no more quests to give out, all of the rewards would be in circulation and players would realize the value of these items because that quest can't be done again!  This would make these items a hot ticket, so to speak.  I don't know about you, but I think it's ok that some rarer items won't be available to all players, that is what makes them rare!  Also, there is one final thing to consider.  Many, if not all, quests have multiple item rewards for you to choose from.  So, even if quest X has run dry of Pink Muskets of Dwarven Feminity, people could still do the quest but just get a different reward.  I think it would all work out in the end.  This way there would be a quest for everyone, but some players who who get different rewards.  However, Blizzard may decide to have every single NPC quest giver have enough rewards and quests for every player on the server.  This would also be a solution, but you would have to bank on the assumption that not every single player would do some quest way over in Stormwind.  Anyways, what do you think?  Any comments, suggestions?

								nice ideas but how bout this,mobs NEVER drop gold, only items,  when wow is first released and everyone starts off they shuld have an x amount of gold in their possession, lets say 10, they would use that 10 gold to buy their starting equipment, etc. so they woud be able to fight mobs to get items of varying levels of rarity, use those items or sell them to NPC's so they can buy NPC items. NPCs shouldnt only carry crap though, if u wanted a considerably high level item an NPC somewhere in the world should be selling it but for a high price and only selling it to you if u meet the qualifications for that item (lvl, str, dex, etc.), that will force players to fight mobs more and sell items found more, those items wouldnt end up in the NPC inventory though they would either be deleted from the server or sent out into the world as raw materials if a server had a set amoutn of gold. no NPC should carry more than one of each item for say one day-3days-week depending on the level of rarity, cept for potions, and the prices of all items would go up as more and more people buy them from NPCs, that way once items were bought from the NPC's people owuld have to find items from mobs, blizz would be aware of the situation and make monsters temporarily tougher and make item drops less rare thus making players resort to finding raw materials, so blizz could make raw materials harder to obtain, that would force players to buy and sell their raw materials to each other to craft items and/or trade those crafted items for items they would need, use those items to go fight mobs and sell items from them to the NPC's or save the money until their seleceted item from the NPC's was in stock. And to keep it even more balanced items woulndnt stay in one town with one vendor, players would recieve news that the next--should we say &quot;shipment&quot;-- of that kind of item would be available in another town, that makes players rent modes of transportation, pay for housing, mabey wear and tear on their equipment etc. keeping a healthy amount of gold out in the hands of NPC's, then as people become higher in lvl and mroe items are being bought now NPC's start to increase the prices of their services and higher increasing item prices,services such as equipment repair, housing rent, transportation rent, and adding taxes to everything that would end up in the &quot;pot&quot; that was talked about earlier that can be distributed in the form of non-interest loans to needy players or sent out to the NPCs or deleted from the world. Even with all this there will be rich players and ultra rich guilds, they will have to store their gold somewhere, so depending on the amoutn of gold they would like to store prices for storage for THEM would increase, no free storage in mass quantaties.
<br>
<br>GOLD STORAGE:
<br>CHESTS: X amount
<br>BANKS(something that allows mass storing): Y amount with a 5-20% storage fee after the amoutn of gold is greater than the X amount. 
<br>
<br>the fee would then be sent into the allmighty &quot;pot&quot; which the GM's would have LIMITED control over, no giving away 100000 gold to someone because theyre an elven sorceress showing mucho clevage(this happens). that way even in an economy where the amoutn of gold in a server isnt fixed, any extra gold or mass piles gathering dust wouldnt cause the price of gold everywhere to fall. also having a guild/player shop should cost an X amoutn of money depending on the city, area in the city ur setting up shop, and a flexible fee that rises and falls depending on the types and rarity and demand of equipment you are selling, all which goes into the pot or is destroyed.

<br>I think I may have an idea to help fix the quest problem and help prevent the GMs from getting a concussion from the Treasury Management Staff. :D Now, this may sound sort of outrageous, but what if every NPC that offered a non-repeatable quest had enough rewards for every player on the server.
<br>
<br>Many, if not all, quests have multiple item rewards for you to choose from. So, even if quest X has run dry of Pink Muskets of Dwarven Feminity, people could still do the quest but just get a different reward.

<br>Hi Banana. Nice post, the problem I see with your first suggestion though is that if you did this the NPC strongholds would probably end up holding more than 20% of NPC wealth. The amount of wealth we have already suggested they hold may be to much if they are refreshed on a weekly basis. The whole idea of having &quot;loot pools&quot; (such as NPC strongholds) is to act as a limitation or safety mechanism on the distrubution of wealth, so the economy doesn't get out of control.
<br>
<br>Without limited &quot;loot pools&quot; that rewards are drawn out of mobs and NPCs could distribute huge amounts of wealth very quickly when players find ways to exploit sections of the economy, before Bliz finds out and can do anything about it. The idea is the existance of &quot;loot pools&quot; will be pretty much invisible to players most of the time, unless something goes wrong.
<br>
<br>It's only when something weird happens and wealth starts flooding out of a particular loot pool at a faster than expected (budgeted) rate that loot pool limitations will come into play and tighten wealth distribution from that activity automatically. This is why we shouldn't allocate too much loot for distrubution through quest rewards, or arena combat or factional PvP rewards or whatever.
<br>
<br>Regarding your second point, I'm thinking that loot pools will probably hold a certain amount of currency and a certain &quot;value of items&quot; (rather than actual items). Then when items are distributed from a loot pool the item hidden value will be deducted from the total &quot;value of items&quot; held in the pool. So it won't matter if most players choose one reward or another, the pool won't run out of that item.

<br>Interesting ideas. Actually I'm guessing from the screenshots released so far that mobs won't [usually] drop much currency at all, and item drops will be much more common. In particular some valuable crafting ingredients will come from mob drops, maybe stuff like the &quot;Holocrons&quot; that h3nkoS talked about. Mobs will drop some currency as well though, especially high end ones like Dragons who spend their time sitting on treasure. :)

<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>I guess a short summary of the current economic model would be something like &quot;ok we don't want the amount of gold in the player economy to get out of hand, and we don't want the amount of powerful items held by players to increase infinitely until you can get anything you want just by asking. Lets try to work out ways to keep the amount of currency and total value of items on the server more or less fixed, and encourage flow of currency and items between various sectors (e.g. the player economy and the NPC sector) to keep the economy functioning properly.&quot;
<br>
<br>Then there are some formulas and theories that have been developed to back up this proposition, which you can see by going back to previous pages. :)

								Thanks for the reply I)ragonSword!  I see your point about loot pools.  It does make more sense for quest rewards to be drawn from a particular pool than to have a fixed amount of each item.  The idea that a loot pool has a certain &quot;total value of items&quot; is a good one as well.  This way it wouldn't matter which item you choose, because the gold will still be drawn out of the pool and into the player's inventory.  It makes a lot of sense to me and I think it would work.  All one would have to do is set the values of these loot pools so that they are appropriate to the difficulty of the quest.  Example:  
<br>
<br>Easy quests = low total value of rewards
<br>Hard quests = high total value of rewards
<br>
<br>Huh.  I can't think of anything more to say.  I'm awestruck by the simplistic beauty of this theory!  (drools all over key board)  :D   
<br>
<br>P.S. - I'll post back later with more thoughts and comments.   :D

								My understanding of the last couple of posts is that rewards recived from quests have a certain value depending on the difficulty of the quest.  There are no item limits so long as they are given the same value worth of items for the quest.  There is one problem I see with this solution; if the same item is given out every time that item will become more common making it less valuable.  To compensate the amount of money also recieved would have to be greater every time the quest was completed so the quest rewards will have the same value.  That is my understanding of it though.  If I am wrong please explain.

<br>
<br>Blizzard needs an economy that won't spiral out of control, hence the economy will need to be monitored and constantly tweaked as the game goes on. BUT they need to keep things simple enough so that the WoW economy rules don't wind up looking like the American Constitution, and so they don't need to employ a permenant staff of college graduates with Advanced Economics degrees to manage the game.
<br>
<br>Good luck, Bliz. If you succeed, give someone in the Oval Office a call, I'm sure he could use your help.
<br>
<br>In all seriousness, though...what are the chances the WoW economy will NEED to be so unlimited that it works 10 or 20 years from now? In that time, surely Blizzard would have given us something flashier still to play with?

								If this game does make an economy that could last decades then its a success otherwise it could be better.  Sure there will be flashier games to play in the decades to come but people will still be playing World of Warcraft.  Meridian 59 was the first MMPOG ever made.  It was made in 1995 by 3DO and is now owned by Near Death Studios.  People still play Meridian 59 even though you could find better graphics on the playstation game console.  Enough people are still playing it that they are changing the graphics engine for a new look but it will still look old in comparison to all the other MMPOGs.  If it is possible it would be best if they could come up with an economic system that would require little maintenance and would never fail.
<br>
<br>New idea regarding instanced areas.  It has been long known that there will be instanced areas in World of Warcraft now that more info has been realease I am curious on how this will affect loot as everbody will be able to fight the rare monsters themselves.  Does this mean that the loot on these rare monsters becomes more common because they can instance their own encounter?  I am not quite sure how the instancing works to be honest but I understand it as any group of players can make an area just for them and other groups of players can also do the same so everyone has equal opportunity to hunt the monsters in those areas and not have as much competetion for loot.  This gets back into having a limited number of a certain item in the game and soulbound items.  I will post again after I have more ideas on this subject.

<br>Yea I think this is pretty true. Although remember that the rules governing the economy will work in the background, so even if they are pretty complex players won’t know about it. I mean rules governing combat will be pretty complex too when you think about it, all the calculations that will need to be made during a fight, taking into account buffs and debuffs, bonuses, spells and skill use etc. But it’s ok because all you see as a player is that “you hit the monster for 20 damage” or whatever.
<br>
<br>For example I’m pretty sure loot drop rules will be quite complex and will take into account lots of stuff including value of currency and items left in the loot pool for that monster class, relative strength of the monster, possibly also your own level (or the average level in your party), some randomness worked into the formula, maybe other stuff too. It won’t be the case that a certain type of creep always drops exactly the same stuff. 
<br>
<br>Rules governing what price a NPC vendor offers you for an item will be pretty complex too and will probably depend on stuff like your reputation with the faction the NPC is tied to, your skill in “trading”, the amount of cash the vendor has left in his “kitty” at the time, possibly the relative scarcity of the item in that part of the world, etc. Rules governing when various “loot pools” are refreshed by Treasury (or whatever Bliz decides to call it) may also be quite complex, rather than the simple “once a week” solution discussed so far.
<br>
<br>The main thing is to put together an economic system that works, that has properly defined targets, budgets and objectives as well as safety mechanisms that come into effect automatically to prevent sections of the economy getting out of control before actual Bliz staff can step in and prevent it. A stitch in time saves nine they say, and setting up a system that is complex but well designed from the start will probably (I think) save a lot of time trying to fix up economic problems further down the track.
<br>
<br>By the way, I wanted to talk about the new Dungeons page on the official WoW site as it contains some info relevant to the WoW economy. Especially a couple of the screenshots:
<br>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040115170801/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=5&amp;Set=49" target="_new">http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=5&amp;Set=49</a>
<br>
<br>This is the first screenshot I’ve seen where they show a “soul bound” item going into inventory. The item is a Lavishly Jewelled BLUE RING which gives +3 Intellect and +2 Stamina, has a minimum level of 10 and, most importantly, is unique and “binds when equipped”. Moridin the Dwarf doesn’t equip the ring but instead offers it to his friend Roont. I guess we assume then that when Roont equips the ring it will be bound to him till he decides to take it off. 
<br>
<br>Maybe when Roont finally takes it off it will be destroyed, or maybe it can be sold to a vendor (we don’t know). Anyway, my point is these Dwarves are only level 20, they are going through the “common” area of a dungeon and haven’t come to the special “instanced” area yet where the high-end monsters and NPCs are, yet they are already coming across soul bound items and passing them around. Even if the Dwarf was level 10 he could still use the item.
<br>
<br>Consider that characters won’t be able to choose a hero specialisation until they reach level 40, and total max level will probably be 100. So it looks like soul bound items are going to be much easier to get your hands on (and use) than I originally expected. Seems like Bliz is going to take the approach that even a level 20 character will come across soul bound stuff pretty often, and will have to think carefully about whether to “equip” it or not. Fairly effective tool to prevent build up of valuable items in the player economy I guess.
<br>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040115170801/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=7&amp;Set=49" target="_new">http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=7&amp;Set=49</a>
<br>
<br>This is the first screenshot I’ve seen where we can see a lot of detail about how the “bag” item storage system will work. Looks like a character will have 5 bag slots and can carry 5 bags at a time. There will be different types of bags, this character has three woollen bags, a green leather bag and a backpack. Each bag contains slots to store things, and you can put more than one of the same type of item in a slot (up to 20 it looks like in this example). 
<br>
<br>So, combined with “weight carried” restrictions this is how Bliz is going to affect how much items characters can carry around with them at once. I’ve heard there will be a similar “bag” system when you go to access your bank account, so that overall item storage space is limited and characters can’t hoard too much stuff. Some higher quality (and more expensive) bags may allow for storage of more than 20 items in one slot, or may have more slots available or whatever.
<br>
<br>What do you think? :P
