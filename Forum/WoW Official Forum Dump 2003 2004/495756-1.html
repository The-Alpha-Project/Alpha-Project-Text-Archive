								<b>.::Noob Information Guide::.</b>
<br>I have put this guide together with all of the information we have been gathering over at (www.warcraftcentral.com) since the game was announced several moons ago, so that the &quot;noobs&quot; may better understand World of Warcraft in hope of building some constructive coversations on the forums instead of &quot;dead horse's&quot; ( posts that were answered and asked many times before )
<br>
<br>A special thanks to everyone who requested I &quot;compile&quot; the guide's in to one. If anyone see's something wrong in the guide, please post and I will do the research and if you are correct I will fix the mistake.  ( I am not perfect ) :)

								<b>:: Introduction to the WoW Universe</b>
<br>The game is set four years after the end of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, in a ravaged Azeroth, wracked with tension. It is up to players to develop the skills and forge the alliances that allow them to survive in this time of strife. - Blizzard World of Warcraft is a MMORPG type game, which stands for Massively Multiplayer, Online Role Playing Game. Basically, tons of people playing together in one world and interacting with each other. WoW features a full 3D world that will include day/night passage, towns, dungeons, castles. This type of game however has a small drawback, Blizzard will have to charge a monthly fee to keep the servers updated. But don't get me wrong there, the quality will be much better than the Battle.Net we know of right now. MMORPGs usually offer an advanced help system online, with many GMs (Game Masters) online that will answer pages of stuck players or ones that are affected by a bug. Cheaters, harassers, etc , are also dealt with easily since the support is active, but also since they can get completely blocked off the server if they get cough.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>:: Combat system</b>
<br>From what we know right now, I can tell that combats won't be action-filled like you might be used to in other RPGs. Blizzard has decided to make it a random-skill system for the battles. making it more balanced for the players with modem connections etc. That kind of system works in that way : your character will have a defense rating, attack rating, damage , etc, and with random rolls, they will be compared with your opponent's in order to decide who has it, and if you block it. There will be a life bar at the top much like Diablo showing the remaining health of the enemy, as well as its name. The battle can end if either one of the two opponents dies (lets hope here its not you :) or you will have the option to flee, but the monster will receive an extra blow and might start running after you. 
<br>
<br>Basically, combat will be quite simple if that method is used, but also more convenient if you need to use spells or items, because browsing a list of 100 items or spells might be hard if you have to interact with the combat (click everywhere etc)
<br>
<br><b>:: Interface</b>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031008175321/http://www.warcraftcentral.com/library/basics/interface1.jpg" target="_new">http://www.warcraftcentral.com/library/basics/interface1.jpg</a>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031008175321/http://www.warcraftcentral.com/library/basics/interface2.jpg" target="_new">http://www.warcraftcentral.com/library/basics/interface2.jpg</a>
<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031008175321/http://www.warcraftcentral.com/library/basics/interface3.jpg" target="_new">http://www.warcraftcentral.com/library/basics/interface3.jpg</a>
<br>
<br>If we refer to these shots, the interface is quite simple, and that's a good thing. At the bottom of the screen are many buttons that will get you through the various statistics and status of your character. We can also notice a 'quick-item' slot at the bottom left that could let you switch through some weapons faster than going into the inventory and looking for it. Your status will be shown at the top left, with what could be your avatar, a health and mana bar. The always useful minimap is located in the top right part of the screen, and you can also notice the chat window at the bottom. The way the character screen pages are open, like the spell one, is quite useful since its not very big and wont hide the game itself. 
<br>
<br>Although the shots above are old, the same principal is used.  WarCry put up a interactive interface to try out to better get you ready for WoW: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031008175321/http://wow.warcry.com/content/interface/" target="_new">http://wow.warcry.com/content/interface/</a>
<br>
<br><b>:: Inventory</b>
<br>
<br><b><i>:Weapons:</i></b>
<br>  <b>Main hand:</b>
<br>Primary weapon or tool will go in this hand. 
<br>Off hand Either shield , another weapon or probably disabled if you use a 2-handed weapon in the main hand. 
<br><b>Ranged weapon:</b>
<br>Secondary (or primary for certain characters) weapon, could be a bow and such. 
<br>Ammunition
<br> Either arrows, bolts, rocks etc. Ammos used in ranged weapons will be stored there. 
<br>
<br><b><i>:Armor:</i></b>
<br> <b>Body:</b>
<br>Body armor and clothes. 
<br><b>Belt:</b>
<br> Used to store potions and scrolls. Different type of belts might have more and less slots, as in Diablo 2. 
<br><b>Fret:</b>
<br> Sleeves 
<br><b>Hands:</b>
<br> Gloves, gauntlets 
<br><b>Head:</b>
<br> Probably an helmet or mask. Anything you could wear on your head ... 
<br><b>Legs:</b>
<br> Leggings, pants and such. 
<br>
<br><b>:Accessories:</b>
<br> <b>Fingers (2):</b>
<br> Most probably rings, as you can find in 99.9% of the RPGs 
<br><b>Neck:</b>
<br> Necklaces or amulets. Still unknown how they will be called. 
<br><b>Trinkets (4):</b>
<br> All sorts of miscellaneous things that you can use. Torches, matches, glasses etc. 
<br><b>Wrists (2):</b>
<br> Bracers will be equipped there. There might be some other stuff, like watches and such. Who knows :) 
<br>
<br><b>::Death Management</b>
<br>Blizzard has been quite quiet on this matter, but they did tell us their wish not to make death stop you from doing heroic actions : 
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>One of the things that we wanted to do was not to distance people from doing any cool heroic things like exploring the world to dying for their friends. We didn't want the penalties for death to be so sever that everybody has to play super conservatively. So of course we're going to have some penalties so players don't do things totally frivolously, but it shouldn't be so painful that it ruins your play experience for the entire night.&quot; <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br><b>:: Skill System </b>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>&quot;One of the things we wanted to achieve with the skill system in this game is to make it easily understandable and accessible and at the same time let you flavor your character and make independant choices so that your level 50 warrior would feel different from another level 50 warrior but not give you so much flexibility that you could screw yourself.&quot; <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>It seems like Blizzard chose a level / skill system much like Diablo 2, but they didn't go very deep yet in the details of how it'll work. There will be core skills, like magic for a mage, where even if you don't spend points you can't be terrible at using it, and that will be learned faster. Each class will also have a variety of secondary skills, from which each person will be able to customize his character differently, to some extent of course.
<br>
<br><b>::Traveling</b>
<br>Have you ever wondered what will it be like to travel long distances in WoW ? If you played previous MMORPGs, you probably already know it can be really tedious, not to say boring, to travel from one place to another while walking or barely running. Blizzard even said that WoW's world would be one of the biggest in any MMORPG to date, so there has to be some way to ease this traveling! Past online games brought a few solutions, here are a few:
<br>
<br>Transportation portal, or 'ringways (Asherons Call) 
<br>Scripted horses, i.e. you don't control it, it goes from point A to B (Camelot) 
<br>Player controlled mouts : You actually buy an animal you can ride (EQ, UO) 
<br>Teleportation NPC rituals (DAoC)...
<br>
<br><b>:: Mounts</b>
<br>Each race has a unique mount (apart from Tauren which are mounts themselves), which they can control freely through the world. Through a Riding skill, players will be able to gain greater benefit from their mount, as well as gain the ability to use other race's animals or even wild ones. From what we have heard from Blizzard, only high level players will have access to the good mounts, while low-level player will have to rely on their own race's mounts or travel by other means (read below). The reputation with the race you wish to use a pet also plays a role, since you won't be able to buy one from an Orc if you don't have a good reputation with them (he won't sell you one). Once bought, mounts are summonable through a scroll in your inventory. They cannot die or be lost, and instantly appear / disappear when you use the scroll. They should also provide some bonus armour while riding, but such bonuses are still secretly discussed at Blizzard. 
<br>
<br>Most race's get their own mounts: 
<br><b>Humans - Horses</b> 
<br><b>Orcs - Wolves</b> 
<br><b>Tauren - None</b> 
<br><b>Dwarf - Ram</b>
<br><b>Night Elf - Night Saber panther</b>
<br><b>Undead - Nightmares</b>
<br><b>Gnome - Unknown</b>
<br><b>Troll: Unkown</b>
<br>
<br><b>:: Transport</b>
<br>Unlike mounts, the other transportation means like Ships, Gryphons and Zeppelins cannot be freely controlled and must be set on course to a valid destination point that you previously 'flagged', or visited. As an example, a human player will go to a Gryphon nest in Dun Morogh, and ask to be traveled to Stormwind, which he was born in. The player will then start flying and will be able to look around the world while he travels. Boats and Zeppelins work the same, but they also add bring some mini-games to make the time pass faster. Ships will get mini-quests (fighting invaders etc) while Zeppelins will get some gambling games. 
<br>
<br>The known transports are: 
<br><b>Gryphon</b> (for human, gnome, and dwarf) 
<br><b>Hippogryph</b> (for NE) 
<br><b>Wyvern</b> (for tauren, orc, and troll) 
<br><b>Some bat creature</b> (for UD) 
<br><b>Zepplin </b>
<br><b>Boat</b> 
<br>
<br><b>::Skills &amp; Potions</b>
<br>In addition to those two traditional traveling ways, various magic scrolls and potions will be available to the player to enhance their speed, or grant them temporary immunity to travel in dangerous locations. Warrior class wouldn't get such spells, but would still be able to use a potion for example. Taurens also get their unique 'sprint' ability which will allow them to travel as fast as another race's mounted players.

								<b>:: Classes</b>
<br>Classes are what makes each race and character diffrent, and is also the core of character evolution in WoW. By choosing one, you get access to a variety of skills, some primary ones related to your class, and secondary trading skills. The class section will eventually offer strategy and guides to choosing your favorite class, but for the time being we only have what Blizzard wants us to have, which is only small information on the overview of each class. You may select a class from the list below for more information. 
<br>
<br><b>Druid:</b>
<br>Druids are a nature-base class with healing, summoning and shapeshifting abilities. When shifted, they can only use that form's abilities. These forms include bear, condor, and most interestly, rabbit. The rabbit form cannot attack, but also does not get attacked by normal monsters, making it a good scout. While in the rabbit form, you also appear the same &quot;color&quot; has neutral monsters, as not to attract suspicion. 
<br>
<br><b>Skills:</b>
<br>Bear 
<br>Condor 
<br>Faerie Fire 
<br>Heal 
<br>Leopard 
<br>Rejuvenation 
<br>Ward 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Tauren 
<br>Night Elf 
<br>
<br><b>Hunter:</b>
<br>The Hunter is a class that is based on ranged weapons such as bows or muskets (for the Dwarves). They prosses the ability to tame beasts as their pet which will fight for them, and could also be used as mount. You will be able to tame your pet as well as have him gain level by fighting. They are similar to the hirelings in Diablo 2 expansion - they get various skills, and level as you do, but a little slower. 
<br>
<br><b>Skills:</b>
<br>Axes 
<br>Beast Soothe 
<br>Beast Tracking 
<br>Defense 
<br>Dual Wield 
<br>Guns 
<br>Pathfinding 
<br>Piercing Weapon 
<br>Ranged Weapon 
<br>Recall Pet 
<br>Swords 
<br>Tame 
<br>Thrown 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Orc 
<br>Tauren 
<br>Dwarf 
<br>Night Elf 
<br>
<br><b>Mage:</b>
<br>From a popular idea, you'd think a mage is a weak character that does a tremendous amount of damage, but can't really survive a monster on his own. Blizzard wants to make this different, by making them tough enough to be able to solo when they can't, or don't want to join a group. Some of Diablo 2's spells are back to help this, such as Frozen Armor, which protects and freezes enemies, as well as Fire shield, which damages enemies over time, and of course a lot of offensive spells (Blizzard, Rain of Fire, etc). 
<br>
<br>Following this path might not be the easiest, but it sure will be one of the most rewarding, both by giving the player an incredible firepower, but also grant them with stunning spell visual effects. You can take a look at our extensive spell list to learn more about the mage's powers. 
<br>
<br><b>Skills:</b>

<br>Charged Bolt 
<br>Death Touch 
<br>Fiery Blast 
<br>Fire Shield 
<br>Fire Strike 
<br>Fireball 
<br>Firebolt 
<br>Freeze 
<br>Frigid Limbs 
<br>Frost Armor 
<br>Frost Blast 
<br>Frozen Plating 
<br>Frozen Touch 
<br>Inferno 
<br>Invisibility
<br>Numb 
<br>Rain of fire 
<br>Scorching Blast 
<br>Summon Elemental  
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Human 
<br>Dwarf 
<br>Undead
<br>
<br><b>Paladin:</b>
<br>This alliance-only class is the combination tank/healer/buffer. Heavy on the defense, paladins can also create seals (fixed areas that provide useful benefits) and auras (such as Devotion or True Sight in Warcraft 3). Paladins can also imbue weapons with magical holy propreties. 
<br>
<br><b>Skills:</b>
<br>Devotion 
<br>Imbue 
<br>Seal 
<br>True Sight 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Human 
<br>Dwarf 
<br>
<br><b>Priest:</b>
<br>These guys are diffrent than traditional clerics, typically chainmail-wearing badasses that heal. Priests can only wear cloth armor, but their spells are based on messing with your target's mind. Besides being the best healer and buffer in the game, the other priest powers (into either Shadow or Holy magic) make him seem more like an inquisitor than a medicine cabinet. Priests use Shadow/Holy Words, which are instant-cast and include: Dominate (make an enemy become your pet), confusion (stop attacking), and fumble (causes opponent to miss). 
<br>
<br><b>Skills:</b>
<br>Confusion 
<br>Dominate 
<br>Fumble 
<br>Heal 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Human 
<br>Dwarf 
<br>Night Elf 
<br>Unead 
<br>
<br><b>Rogue:</b>
<br>Your standard stealthly rogue, but the most damaging in direct offense; warriors are tanks who can take damage, but rogues are the ones who deliver damage. In addition to a bunch of slick attack moves (backstab, swift strikes, sap/knockouts), rogues can also poison their weapons (either enhancing damage or adding damage-over-time effects) and use disguises to get past enemies (stealth). 
<br>
<br><b>Skills:</b>
<br>Backstab 
<br>Knockout 
<br>Swift Strike 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Human 
<br>Orc 
<br>Dwarf 
<br>Night Elf 
<br>Unead
<br>
<br><b>Shaman:</b>
<br>The shaman doesn't seem to have a different look so far, or might not be revealed yet. Still here, Blizzard stays small with details, throw away a bunch of screenshots for us to decipher! From what we know about shamans, they tend to be the healing and buffing class, in the way that they use spells to power up allies, such as bloodlust, unholy armor, etc. They will also be able to go on their own, attacking monsters from various ways, such as using a weapon, or nature based spell like root, which makes the monster unable to move, and an easy target for a ranged weapon or spell.
<br>
<br>Since shamans call upon the spirits of the spirit world rather than energy like the mage, it often doesn't have much direct-damage spell-based attacks (still has a few ...), and could be classified as a hybrid warrior-mage, much like a druid would be, allthough 'shaman' refers to summoning nature where a druid is more likely to use nature's powers.

<br>Lightning Bolt 
<br>Lightning Shield 
<br>Restoration 
<br>RockSkin 
<br>Root 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Orc 
<br>Tauren 
<br>
<br><b>Warlock:</b>
<br>The warlock is a fire and shadow magic caster who can cast direct-damage spells, like Firebolt and Death Coil, as well as spells that cause damage over time, like Immolation and Corruption, which drain hit points continually. Most important, the warlock is an expert in demonic magic who, as he/she levels up, will accumulate a suite of demons-including (in increasing order of strength) imps, felhounds, succubi, and void walkers-that can be summoned as pets. Unlike other summoning classes, however, the warlock develops a specific relationship with his pets. The imp he summons will be the same imp with the same name every time (A demon that dies in combat will revert to a demonic plane and recharge over time.) Unlike mage pets, you can control demons directly-they'll have their own interface so you can use them to attack specific targets or use specific abilities. Finally, warlocks can create a powerful item called a Soul Stone that will instantly revive anyone who is carrying it upon death.

<br>Summon Void Walker 
<br>Unarmed 
<br><b>Possible races:</b>
<br>Human 
<br>Orc
<br>Undead
<br>
<br><b>Warrior:</b>
<br>Well known by anyone, warriors are pure fighters, who wield many types of weapons in order to vanquish their enemies. &quot;We wanted to give the warriors a lot of in combat abilities.&quot; As early as the first few levels, they will be equipped with a variety of skills so that they can reach higher skill level with fast, and then specialize. Defend is one of the first skill you'll get, which you can recognize out of Warcraft 3's footman, and now increases armor class for a period of time. 
<br>
<br>While being 'magical', these are purely power-up skills and will probably use some kind of mana or concentration points, and wear off after a time. 
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>&quot;Warriors in a lot of these games don't feel like they have a lot of things that they can do. That won't be the case in our game, he'll have as nearly as many options as a spellcaster would, but they'll just take a different form, like that of slice and dice and defend. Through the course of your play experience, we're intending to give players fundamental changes to their mechanics. That means lots of abilities.&quot; - Blizzard Entertainment <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>

								<b>:: Races</b>
<br><b>Introduction to character creation:</b>
<br>When you start the game, you will be able to choose from the 8 (Blizzard said there would be 8) available racse. There will also be a choice between male and female characters for all races. You will probably enjoy customizing them, as you can choose skin color, face model, hair stile and such. You will be able to see what you are building since there is a full-3D avatar that you see while you setup your attributes. As of now, there are no reports saying that you assign any stat points, so I guess Blizzard wanted it to remain simple. When you're done with that , the adventure begins, but you should take a look at this section so that you know exactly what character to choose :)
<br>
<br><b>Affiliation:</b>
<br>Players in WoW will see themselves affiliated with a group of races, the Horde or the Alliance (might have more, but that's all we know more). Each alliance will provide their racial members with a better faction, and more compatible items. On the other hand, the opposite faction towns and items will be hostile to them, thus much harder to visit and cooperate with. 
<br>
<br><b>Possible Others:</b>
<br>It has been mentioned and even rumored that Blizzard will add more races.  The final races known were just introduced in the October issue of Computer Gaming World ( Go get yourself a copy )
<br>
<br><b>Tauren:</b>
<br>The Tauren are huge, bestial creatures who live in the grassy, open barrens of central Kalimdor. They live to serve nature and maintain the balance between the wild things of the land and the restless spirit of the elements. Despite their enormous size and brute strength, the remarkably peaceful Tauren cultivate a quiet, tribal society. However, when roused by conflict, Tauren are implacable enemies who will use every ounce of their strength to smash their enemies under hoof. Under the leadership of their ancient chief, Cairne Bloodhoof, the Tauren allied themselves with the Orcs during the invasion of the Burning Legion. The two races have remained steadfast allies ever since. Like the Orcs, the Tauren struggle to retain their sense of tradition and noble identity.
<br>
<br><b>Available classes:</b>
<br>Druid
<br>Hunter
<br>Shaman
<br>Warrior
<br><b>Start Location:</b>
<br>Redrock Mesa, Mulgore 
<br><b>Affiliation:</b> 
<br>Horde
<br><b>Mount:</b> 
<br>Since Taurens are too big to ride an animal, they get an enhanced speed bonus, called Planes Running, which allows them to run as fast as a mount.
<br>
<br><b>Dwarf:</b>
<br>The stoic dwarves of Ironforge are an ancient race of robust humanoids who live beneath the snow-capped mountains of Khaz Modan. The Dwarves have always been fast allies with the Humans, and they revel in the prospects of battle and storytelling alike. In past ages, the Dwarves rarely left the safety of their mountain fortresses. However, whenever the call to battle sounded, they rose up to defend their friends and allies with unmatched courage and valor. Due to a recent discovery that uncovered fragments of their ancient origins, the Dwarves have undergone a remarkable transformation. The discovery convinced the Dwarves that the mighty Titans created them from stone when the world was young. They feel that their destiny is now to search the world over for more signs and proof of their enchanted heritage and to rediscover the Titans' hidden legacies. To this end, the Dwarves have sent out their Prospectors to all ends of the world in the hopes of discovering new insight into their shrouded past. These journeys led to Dwarven excavation sites all over the known world, some of which serve as outposts and some of which serve as potential hunting grounds for enemies of the Dwarven race.

<br>Ram
<br>
<br><b>Human:</b>
<br>The Humans of Stormwind are a resilient breed, having survived an invasion by the savage Orcs during the First War. During the Second War, the armies of Stormwind rallied with the Alliance to reclaim their homeland of Azeroth. After the success of the Second War, Stormwind was rebuilt and Human civilization began to flourish once again throughout the southlands. With the recent invasion of the Burning Legion - which left the northern kingdom of Lordaeron in ruins - Stormwind now stands as the last bastion of human civilization. Following the heroic examples of the legendary Sir Lothar and King Llane, the defenders of Stormwind are considered to be among the fiercest warriors in the land. They stand resolute in their charge to maintain the honor and might of humanity in an ever-darkening world.

<br><b>Mount:</b> 
<br>Horse
<br>
<br><b>Orc:</b>
<br>The savage, green-skinned Orcs are one of the most prolific races of Azeroth. They are commonly believed to be brutal and mindless, possessing no humanity or empathy for other races. Born on the hellish world of Draenor, the Orcs were brought into the kingdom of Stormwind through the dimensional gateway known as the Dark Portal and forced to wage war on the Humans. Although few are aware of their history, the Orcs once cultivated a noble, Shamanistic society on the world of Draenor. Tragically, the proud Orc clans were corrupted by the Burning Legion and used as pawns in the Legion's invasion of Azeroth. The Orcs managed to rebel, however, and they were ultimately able to help turn the tide against their demon masters. Led by the young Warchief, Thrall, the Orcs have reclaimed their strength and honor. Now, the Orcs stand ready to fight not for the sake of conquest, but for their right to survive in their adopted world.

<br>Horde
<br><b>Mount:</b> 
<br>Wolf
<br>
<br><b>Night Elf:</b>
<br>The reclusive Night Elves were the first race to awaken in the World of Warcraft. These shadowy, immortal beings were the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before Warcraft I. The Night Elves' reckless use of magic drew the Burning Legion into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their wondrous homeland was shattered and drowned by the sea. Ever since, the Night Elves refused to use magic for fear that the dreaded Legion would return. The Night Elves closed themselves off from the rest of the world and remained hidden atop their holy mountain of Hyjal for many thousands of years. As a race, Night Elves are typically honorable and just, but they are very distrusting of the 'lesser races' of the world. They are nocturnal by nature and their shadowy powers often elicit the same distrust that they have for their mortal neighbors.

<br>Nightsabers (white tigers)?
<br>
<br><b>Undead:</b>
<br>Having broken free from the tyrannical rule of the Lich King, a renegade group of undead seek to retain their own free will while destroying all those who oppose them. Known as the Forsaken, this group is dedicated to serving their leader, the banshee queen Sylvanas Windrunner. These dark warriors have established a secret stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron's former capital city. Situated deep beneath the cursed Tirisfal Glades, the labyrinthine Undercity is a sprawling bastion of evil. Within its shadowy confines, Sylvanas' royal apothecaries scramble to develop a devastating new plague - one which will not only eradicate their hated Scourge rivals, but the rest of humanity as well. To further their dark aims, the Forsaken have entered into an alliance of convenience with the primitive, brutish races of the Horde. Holding no real loyalty for their newfound comrades, the Forsaken have duped them into fighting against their common enemy - the Lich King. Only time will tell how these disciples of doom will fair in their mission of vengeance.

								<b>:: Bestiary</b>
<br><b>Basalisk</b>
<br>These powerful, enchanted creatures are something of an anomaly throughout the land of Azeroth. They are not known for their ill temper, but if provoked, these hulking creatures will defend themselves and their nesting grounds with ferocity. Fond of the legendary &quot;singing crystals&quot; of Stranglethorn, the Basilisk have learned that consuming these crystals will give them exceptional powers to lull their prey to sleep or even turn them to stone. As a side effect of eating the crystals, the Basilisk have mutated: the mystical crystals now grow from their scaly hides, giving them have even greater power against their enemies.
<br>
<br>   <b>Bear</b>
<br>Rencently seen beside a Night Elf in a recent screenshot update, bears seem to be tamable by Night Elves, or could be summoned by druids. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Boar</b>
<br>Recently seen in a screenshot from Blizzard's Insider (#12), this boar seems to be roaming around pumpkin fields in Westfall. Not much information is known about them yet though, they might as well just be some critter. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Furbolg</b>
<br>What once were believed to be only whispers and rumors of attacks by savage and cruel bands of furbolgs in the night elves' enchanted forest have become and increasing concern for the Sentinels. It is thought that the passing of the Burning Legion and the vestiges of its demonic taint drove the simple and peaceful bear-men to madness. Their aged and wizened leaders have been replaced by ruthless firebrrands who lead the crazed furbolgs to prey upon the denizens of Ashenvale Forest. Where the furbolgs coexisted peacefully with the night elves for ages, with claw and fang they now seek to carve out their own home in the endless forest. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Gnoll</b>
<br>The cunning Gnoll packs of the Redridge Mountains have notoriously plagued the Human and Dwarven kingdoms alike. Recent times, however, have seen the Riverpaw Pack of Gnolls became a more ominous threat, raiding farms and Human villages throughout Elwynn forest. Many speculate that the historically dimwitted Gnolls have conspired with another force, which is equipping them with weapons, tactical leadership, and magic. Though it is unclear what the Gnolls are after, the Stormwind Marshals have now realized that the creatures pose an obvious threat to the kingdom and must be eradicated. 
<br>
<br>  <b>Murloc</b>
<br>No real information yet. Some water creature seen in Warcraft 3, can be of multiple classes.  
<br> 
<br>  <b>Raptor</b>
<br>Dinosaurs are a mighty prehistoric race capable of great strenght in battle when required. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Tarantula</b>
<br>This monster has been updated to a new 'Venom Spider' version on Blizzard's site. It is unknown right now wether tarantulas will stay or if Venom Spiders will replace them. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Tiger</b>
<br>Not much information yet from Blizzard, but you probably know what a tiger is! 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Venom Spider</b>
<br>Long ago, Elynn Forest was populated with a group of Spiders that lived peacefully among the woods. However, when the curse fell over Duskwood - turning the once peaceful woodland into a realm of terror - the Spiders begain to mutate and grow to monstrous proportions. Now, the lurking Venom Spider hunt their hapless prey in all of the shadowed corners of the land. Possessing both dedaly acidic venom and powerful webbing, these cruel beasts stalk any foolish wanderers who stray too far into the haunted woods. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Wolf</b>
<br>Well, wolves are wolves. They are creatures that usualy travel in clans, so encountering one of those alone is somewhat rare. They are fierce opponents even with the lack of weapons as their they have a powerful jaw to counter this. 
<br>
<br>  <b>Defias Thief</b>
<br>Legend holds that the Defias Brotherhood was founded by a group of noblemen who once stood for freedom and justice. Having long ago forsaken those noble virtues, the mysterious Defias faction is now composed of thieves, bandits, and vicious mercenaries. This vile group is determined to wreak havoc upon and ultimately destroy the House of Nobles in Stormwind City. Convinced that the Nobles are corrupt and villainous, the Defias Brotherhood has waged an underground war in their quest to rid the land of their hated enemies.  
<br> 
<br>  <b>Frostmane Troll</b>
<br>The Frostmane Trolls once ruled over the frigid lands of Dun Morogh, only to have their empire fall to Dwarven armies. These tribal creatures were driven to the hills in retreat -- a shameful blow to their warring nature. With King Magni’s forces split between the Alliance Wars and quelling the Trogg invasion, the Frostmane Trolls have seized the opportunity to reclaim Dun Morogh in an attempt to restore the kingdom that crumbled under Dwarven might ages ago. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Harpy</b>
<br>Once content to confine themselves to their ancestral home in th epeaks of the Stonealon Mountains, the feral and vicious harpies of Kalimdor have spread their influence across the length and breadth of the continent. The vicious winged women have taken to raiding unsuspecting caravans and savaging any who cross into their territories. Their nests, littered with the gruesome remains of their victims, are now a common sight from the arid mesas of Durotar to the lush forests of Kalidar. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Harvest Golem</b>
<br>The terrifying Harvest Golems are mechanical constructs programmed to hunt down and terminate the Human inhabitants of Westfall. Though their origin is uncertain, some believe that only the wily Goblins could have created these mechanical monstrosities. Others speculate that the Defias Thieves had the Harvest Golems built to scare off the local inhabitants of Westfall so that they could run their smuggling operations with greater impunity. Whatever the case may be, the Harvest Golems have done their jobs well - eliciting terror in anyone foolish enough to roam the fallow fields of Westfall alone. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Jungle Troll</b>
<br>The Jungle Trolls are dark, superstitious creatures who revel in the hunt and the rigors of personal combat. In ancient times, the Jungle Trolls reigned over the lands south of the Redridge Mountains. Though their glorious kingdoms have since fallen to ruin, they seek to reclaim the dark majesty of their former empire. Equipped with voodoo magics and unparalleled combat skills, these Trolls have become relentless in their efforts to reclaim their jungle homeland. 
<br>
<br>  <b>Kobold</b>
<br>The grimy, vermin-like Kobolds dwell deep within the crags and rocky caves of the Redridge Mountains. These slovenly creatures are best known for their penchant for digging and their underground excavations. Most recently, the Kobolds have found themselves falling prey to the merciless Riverpaw Pack of Gnolls. These cunning Gnolls have proven themselves to be merciless taskmasters, forcing the Kobolds into an existence of neverending drudgery. Since their enslavement, the historically meek Kobolds have grown bitter and aggressive toward any creature that meddles with their ceaseless labor. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Ogre</b>
<br>Ogres appeared early in the Warcraft games, and never left them since. They are big and strong creatures that use pure strenght to fight their opponents. However, there are new species of ogres, called ogremages, that are gifted with magical powers, making them even more deadly.  
<br> 
<br>  <b>Worgen</b>
<br>The wolf-like worgen creatures are still quite unknown for Warcraft fans. They were introduced in the March 2003 gameplay movie, where a bunch of players would fight arena monsters. Blizzard later explained that they would be in ! 
<br>
<br>  <b>Ghoul</b>
<br>Much like their weaker brothers, skeletons, ghouls are slow and clumsy. Probably one of the easiest early monsters in the game, these can sometimes be found in town at night and in cemeteries (i.e. Darkshire). There are a few shots of a female warrior fighting them in the screenshot gallery. Image is courtesy of Computer Gaming World. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Skeleton</b>
<br>A strange darkness has recently engulfed the region of Duskwood, bringing out Skeletons and other Undead creatures from deep within the shadows. While gangly and seemingly frail, the Skeletons possess superhuman strength and are highly resistant to most physical attacks. Though it is unclear whom the Skeletons work for or whether they serve a greater purpose at all, it is alarmingly clear that they seek to destroy anything in their paths. 
<br>
<br>  <b>Bog Beast</b>
<br>Nothing is known about this creature, and even its name is only temporary. He was revealed in February 2002 in Gamespy's preview. It looks qite similar to the treant, having a green tree-like body and such, and we wouldn't be surprised to see them side by side in StrangleThorn. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Dark Hound</b>
<br>Dark hounds are known for being the ones guarding the gate to hell ; they have sharp and deadly claws and can inflict deadly damage. No in-game screenshot has been released so far.
<br> 
<br>  <b>Green Dragon Spawn</b>
<br>Heeding the call of their goddess, Ysera, the Green Dragonspawn stand to protect Azeroth from the waking evil within the Sunken Temple. Dragonspawn form the ranks of the ground army within each of the five great dragonflights. Among the murk-ridden marshes of the Swamp of Sorrows, the Green Dragonspawn patrol at the behest of their dreaming mistress; Ysera has warned of a lurking terror within the temple, and her loyal servants are determined to protect the land from the emerging doom. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Rockjaw Trogg</b>
<br>According to early legend, after the Titans chained the Ancient Gods beneath the world, they attempted to forge a race to protect the harmony of the planet. Their first experiment failed, however, and the land was riddled with violent creatures known as Troggs. Recognizing their mistake, the Titans buried the Troggs far beneath the soil. In recent times, the eager digging of the Dwarves has released Troggs upon Khaz-Modan once again. In Dun Morogh, the Rockjaw tribe found its way to daylight when the Dwarven tunneling at the Gol'Bolar Quarry delved too deeply under the snowy mountains. 
<br>
<br>  <b>Treant</b>
<br>Featured in the gameplay trailer, this creature is a humanoid tree. It could be quite strong since trees are big, but we have some reports that this is part of one of the easiest quests (Firestar Sword). You can have a look at our Quests section to know more about it.. :)

								So far we have covered a lot of the &quot;basic information&quot; with a little advance info added here and there, but not to overly powering for the noob mind.  This part of the guide is a little more advanced, however it is still not too much.   :)
<br>
<br><b>:: Primary Skills</b>
<br>Magic has always been present and impressive in RPGs, and from the info we gathered, they will be even more spectacular in WoW. Here is the actual list of spells that should be in WoW. Of course, we will update this section every time we learn something new about spells and/or their effects.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>&quot; Yes, quite a few even. World of Warcraft has the spells that you know from Warcraft 2 and quite a few new interesting ones. The usage of spells is through the mouse in a very easy way on the screen.&quot; 
<br>Because of that fact, we decided to include possible spells from Warcraft 2.<hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br><b>.: Mage :.</b>  
<br><b>Cold Magic</b>  
<br>  <b>Blizzard:</b>
<br>Ice shards falling from the sky are summoned in order to deal massive damage to every foes in the casting area. This spell was seen in action in the ECTS gameplay trailer, so no icon available for it yet, but it looks quite powerful. 
<br>In-game shot here 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Chains of Ice:</b>
<br>Sends a cold blast to a target causing damage. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Freeze:</b>
<br>Sends a bolt of cold magic to an opponent and freezes him for a time, allowing the caster and his group to finish down the unfortunate aggressor. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Frigid Limbs:</b>
<br>This is another cold spell that attacks and damages the legs and arms of a target with biting cold, like other cold spells this slows the enemy down considerably. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Frost Armor:</b>
<br>Back from Diablo 2, this is a mage armor that once cast, will raise the caster's armor rating as well as slowing attackers. 
<br>In-game shot here 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Frost Blast:</b>
<br>Once a sorceress' spell in diablo 2, this is now a damage-only cold-based spells that you can cast at opponents. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Frozen Touch:</b>
<br>This spell covers the target with ice, stunning him for quite a while. It has been reported to have a huge delay before you can recast it. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Frozen Plating:</b>
<br>Another cold-based spell, this one will increase the armor rating of the character by even more. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Numb:</b>
<br>A cold-based spell that once cast, slows and damages the target for a time. 
<br> 
<br><b>Fire Magic</b> 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Fiery Blast:</b>
<br>Direct-damage fire-based spell. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Fireball</b>
<br>A common spell in most RPGs, fireball usualy shoots an area-effect fire-based spell that damages enemies in a small radius where the blast is. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Firebolt</b>
<br>Direct-damage fire-based spell. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Fire Shield:</b>
<br>Creates an aura of fire around the mage, damaging anything going melee with the character. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Inferno:</b>
<br>Seed on some E3 screenshots, inferno is a 'breat' of fire released that constantly strikes for a small amount of damage / second. 
<br>
<br>  <b>Rain of fire:</b>
<br>Probably much like Blizzard, this spell will call flames that will fall from the sky and burn your enemies. This should be a area-type spell. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Scorching Blast:</b>
<br>Another direct damage fire spell. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Fire Strike:</b>
<br>Direct-damage fire-based spell. 
<br> 
<br><b>Other Magic:</b>  
<br>  
<br>  <b>Death Touch:</b>
<br>You summon swirling clouds of death around enemies that causes damage to them. No movie of this spell in action was seen, but some previews report an instant-kill to a human enemy. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Charged Bolt:</b>
<br>This is a spell that was shown in the gameplay trailer released at ECTS. It seems quite strong, based on the movie. It is still unknown what the name is, only speculations here. 
<br>In-game shot here 
<br>
<br>  <b>Invisibility:</b>
<br>Whether a mage needs to infiltrate an enemy camp or quickly avoid a bad situation, they can make themselves undetectable using the Invisibility spell.

<br>High level mages will be able to summon elemental to assist them 
<br> 
<br> 
<br><b>.: Shaman :.</b>

<br>  <b>Ancestral Healing:</b>
<br>A higher version of the heal spell, allthough it cannot be used in combat, it can fully heal a character after a fight. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Bark Skin:</b>
<br>Much like the mage's frozen armor spell, this is a weaker version of the rock skin spell and increases AR (Armor Rating). 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Bloodlust</b>
<br>Strenght buff spell available to the Shaman class. Raises the target's carry limit as well as damage for a time. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Heal:</b>
<br>The good old heal spell, it is used to recover your health and sometimes cure from poison and other diseases. Cannot be cased while in combat. 
<br>In-game shot here

<br>Shaman-only buff, this is similar to Fireshield and damages enemies with Energy magic instead of Fire.

<br>Does not do any damage, but stuns the target in ice for a time. The ice prison breaks if the target is attacked. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Lightning Bolt:</b>
<br>Seen on the tauren shaman screenshot, a lightning falls from the sky and strikes the target. This is a suggested name, and might not be used at all. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Root:</b>
<br>Root is a shaman spell used to brind enemies to the ground so that they cannot attack until the spell is dispelled or ends. Useful for taking down monsters from afar or for hunting groups.

<br>Not much is known about this spell. It has been confirmed in the CGW's November 2001 issue that it would be part of the game. This would require many people to cast, a ritual of some sort involving lot of work. It could be used to access special quest-areas and such, and looks quite awesome right now. Group-cast spells is a feature that a lot of people would like to see, and this is likely to be implemented in the game. 
<br> 
<br>  <b>Word of Recall:</b>
<br>A spell used to warp to a previously marked bind spot or to the nearest town. This kind of spell is always very useful in MMORPGs, since the world is so big that it can take hours to travel from one side to another . Think of this as the rune/recall system from UO if you know about it.

								<b>:: Secondary Skills</b>
<br>
<br>Secondary skills are similar to primary class skill in the way that they need to be trained in order to be efficient in a particular ability. However, the way to train these might differ from primary skill (usage instead of points). Secondary skills won't be as much class-specific as primary ones, but still will only be available for certain classes (herbalism for mages for example). 
<br>
<br>Skills are displayed through a list in the character sheet. Skills with red text are hardest to use (ingrediants rarer), but make skill raise faster when you are successful. Grey is easy (as a matter of fact you always succeed) but much much less skill gain. 
<br>
<br>The list below only contains a basic list of what we have heard, as well as short description of what it should do. Blizzard hasn't released more information on this yet. 
<br>
<br><b>Global Skills</b> 
<br>
<br> <b>Alchemy:</b> 
<br>In combination with herbalism and other various skills, alchemy is an ability in creating various healing and stat enhancement potions. This is probably related with spell-user classes.  
<br>
<br> <b>Cooking:</b> 
<br>Not sure yet what you'll be able to cook, but it seems Blizzard is planning to have trade skills work with another one. Cooking could be used with fishing for example to make the fish you catch worth more life point when you 'use' them.  
<br>
<br> <b>First Aid:</b> 
<br>This will probably be used with health kits, bandages, and such items, and most probably available for Warrior classes.  
<br>
<br> <b>Fishing:</b> 
<br>Ability to use a fishing rod to catch various kind of fishes. We still don't know what you will be able to do with fish though.  
<br>
<br> <b>Gathering:</b> 
<br>By learning this skill you can extract ingredients from bushes “herb”, it will also shows dots on the minimap where herbs are.  
<br>
<br> <b>Herbalism:</b> 
<br>As mentionned before, this skill is used to create and transform various kind of herb for medicinal (first aid) usage or potion-making (alchemy). Using your &quot;find herbs&quot; ability, you can quickly pinpoint spots on your minimap that have useful plants.Specific types that give specific ingrediants only spawn in specific areas, like in caves, coasts, etc.  
<br>
<br> <b>Language:</b> 
<br>Language will be a secondary skill and it will require you to upgrade to speak to another race, for example a Human and Orc cannot understand each other until they learn the language.  
<br>
<br> <b>Leatherworking:</b> 
<br>Most probably the ability to craft leather-based armor and components.  
<br>
<br> <b>Lockpicking:</b> 
<br>Ability to pick various door and chest locks with the use of lockpicks.  
<br>
<br> <b>Mining:</b> 
<br>Seen on two screenshots published on May 13th, we can see that dwarves at least will have that ability. More to be known soon hopefully !  
<br>
<br> <b>Riding:</b> 
<br>The riding skill will allow a character to use a mount that isn't native to his race, as well as enhanced speed.  
<br>
<br> <b>Tailoring:</b> 
<br>This skill reflects how good a character is in making shirts, pants, as well as cloth armor. We are not sure if tailoring and leatherworking have anything in common yet.  
<br>
<br> <b>Trade:</b> 
<br>Bonus to merchant prices/costs. Higher level trade skills might require the player to go to Lab/Smith.  
<br>
<br> <b>Wilderness Survival:</b> 
<br>Various potion and item effeciveness will be determined by this skill.  
<br>
<br><b>::World</b>
<br>This information about the world is based on Brann's Journal from the first WoW Official Site.  These are the areas and what you lands you will find there:
<br>
<br><b>Azeroth</b> 
<br>Duskwood
<br>Elwynn Forest
<br>Stranglethorn Vale
<br>Swamp of Sorrows
<br>WestFall

<br>
<br><b>Undermine</b> 
<br>Deadmines  
<br>
<br>Not very interesting is it?  Ok.. lets get a little more informative shall we?
<br>
<br><b>Duskwood:</b>
<br>Once the lush southern belt of Elwynn Forest, the land of Duskwood has transformed into a dark and mysterious land. Many speculate that its proximity to the mysterious Deadwind Pass brings monstrous horrors out at night. Others wonder if an ancient curse has been cast upon the land. No matter the reason, Duskwood has become a land of terror and superstition. The Human farmers who once toiled over the rich land have become dark and brooding - unwilling to leave their ancestral home but unable to lift the terrible cloud that has settled over their lives. Bordered by the fallow fields of Westfall to the west and the dark, treacherous Deadwind Pass to the east, Duskwood has become a tainted realm where shadows and evil permeate the atmosphere even during the brightest hours of day.

<br>
<br><b>Elwynn Forest:</b>
<br>Elwynn Forest is a vast woodland that cradles the Human civilization of Azeroth. Though much of the area was burned or destroyed during the First War - when the Orcs laid siege to Stormwind - the giant trees and lush glades have grown anew. Heavily patrolled by the mighty Stormwind Garrison, Elwynn has remained a peaceful land since the war's end. Several farms stretch across the fertile fields, and the Garrison Guard Towers stand vigilant every few miles, helping to keep the forest safe from the rampaging forces of the Horde. The tranquil forest is also inhabited by wild Boars and Wolves that hunt throughout the woodlands in hope of finding easy prey. Scraggly Gnolls and grimy Kobolds wander the forest's outlying regions, but seldom do these timorous creatures attack property in Elwynn or Stormwind directly. For the most part, Elwynn exudes a feeling of comfort and serenity. However, if travelers wander too far off the main roads they may still encounter hidden dangers lurking within the shadows.

<br>
<br><b>StrangleThorn:</b>
<br>Stranglethorn is a vast jungle south of Duskwood. Once the extended homeland of the mysterious Jungle Trolls, Stranglethorn is now dotted with ancient ruins and crumbling Troll cities. In recent years, the Humans of Stormwind attempted to forge trade routes through this savage jungle. Though they did manage to establish the small port town of Blackwater Cove, they were quickly overwhelmed by a crazed pack of Trolls and driven back to their homeland. In the wake of the Humans' departure, the crafty Goblin Trade Princes arrived on the jungle's shores and quickly set up their mining and deforesting operations. The Goblins have maintained a tenuous hold over these remote facilities, but they remain threatened by the Jungle Trolls' growing obsession with purging their ancient lands of any and all foreign invaders.

<br>
<br><b>Westfall:</b>
<br>Once the breadbasket of the kingdom of Stormwind, the land of Westfall has now grown fallow from years of conflict and neglect. Crops are no longer cultivated in the fields, and the once abundant mines have been deserted. Even the former defenders, the Stormwind Garrisons, pulled stake and abandoned the lonely realm when the cost of upkeep became too great. Due to this lack of military protection, Westfall has been all but destroyed by the rebel Defias Brotherhood and its demi-human minions. The Brotherhood, composed of thieves and bandits, have made Westfall their refuge. Employing everything from local superstitions to mechanical Harvest Golems, the Brotherhood will stop at nothing to scare away trespassers and protect their malicious schemes from being unraveled.

<br>
<br><b>Kalidar:</b>
<br>Off Kalimdor's northern coast lies the island of Kalidar, the new home of the reclusive Night Elves and a stunning testament to the power of their magic and their connection with nature. After the cataclysmic events that followed the invasion of the Burning Legion, the Circle of Ancients and powerful druids combined their powers to grow an immense new world tree on Kalidar. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning &quot;crown of the earth&quot; in their native tongue. The night elves made their new home in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time. However, the calm of the enchanted forest has slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Crazed furbolgs and fouler beasts have appeared in Kalidar, and it occupies all the attention of the vigilant Sentinels and the wise druids to ensure the safety of their new home.

<br>
<br><b>Dun Morogh:</b>
<br>The jagged, snowy peaks of Dun Morogh provide the Ironforge Dwarves with a limitless supply of ore and stone for their ambitious engineering endeavors. From the city of Ironforge, dug deep into the mountains, to Anvilmar in the Coldridge Valley, the marvels of Dwarven ingenuity mark the land. Not all is at peace in Dun Morogh, however. The Dwarves’ insatiable digging at the Gol’Bolar Quarry unleashed a menacing tribe of Rockjaw Troggs from their subterranean den. While the massing Trogg invasion looms over the lands of King Magni Bronzebeard, the Frostmane Trolls have taken advantage of the distraction to attempt to reclaim their ancestral home. Life is harsh in the white-powdered mountains of Dun Morogh, but what the Dwarven people lack in height they make up for in heart and valor.

<br>
<br><b>RedRidge</b>
<br>South of Dun Morogh are the Redridge Mountains, where kobold miners dig deep into the mountain and gnoll parties patrol the riverlands. One ambitious clan, the Riverpaw Gnolls, have enslaved the kobolds, making the latter even more irritable when you come across them. While most Dwarves care little for the suffering of a few kobolds, particularly with the new menace of the Troggs and Trolls, the fact that the Riverpaw Gnolls suddenly have their act together is cause for alarm. Whether the newfound competence is the result of dark magic or a Tony Robbin's confidence-building seminar has yet to be determined. 
<br>
<br>The Redridge Mountains are also home to Blackrock Spire, originally built by the Dwarves and taken over by the Orcs in Warcraft 2. Built on Blackrock Mountain (naturally) it links Dwarven and Human kingdoms together. As players venture through the passageway linking the two peoples, they'll have a chance to see the huge rivers of lava flowing beneath narrow bridges supported by huge chains.

<br>
<br><b>Teldrassil Island:</b> 
<br>Off Kalimdor's northern coast lies the island of Teldrassil, the new home of the reclusive Night Elves and a stunning testament to the power of their magic and their connection with nature. After the cataclysmic events that followed the invasion of the Burning Legion, the Circle of Ancients and powerful druids combined their powers to grow an immense new world tree on Teldrassil.

However, the calm of the enchanted forest has slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Crazed furbolgs and fouler beasts have appeared in Teldrassil, and it occupies all the attention of the vigilant Sentinels and the wise druids to ensure the safety of their new home.
<br>
<br>A sprawling city of moonstone and wood, the night elf capital of Darnassus stands as a shining beacon atop Teldrassil. Within its mighty walls are housed countless druids, hunters, and warriors, led by the priestess of Elune, Tyrande Whisperwind. A stunning marvel to the ability of night elven craftsmen, the ethereal Temple of the Moon rises above the tree line, balanced by the druids' meticulously cultivated meditative grove. Trade from the main continent bustles through the city's trade quarter, where night elves, dwarves and humans alike haggle for wares and services. Delicate bridges and pathways crisscross the serene waterways of the city, the pristine waters reflecting the glowing light from the moons above.

<br><b>:: Major Cities</b>
<br>In addition to small towns, forts, and outposts there are 6 major cities in the world of Azeroth. Each of the major cities represents the capital and a major hub for the races that inhabit them. The cities are all radically different from each other in themes and appearances. More than just a collection of buildings with NPCs standing around, the cities will serve as a place for adventuring, shopping, training, socializing, and much more.

<br>
<br><b>:: Legendary Heroes of WoW</b>
<br>Welcome to the Legendary Heroes. Here you will learn about your favourite heroes and their place in the Warcraft universe up to WoW.
<br>
<br><b>Alleria:</b>
<br>
<br>Class : Ranger 
<br>Affiliation : The Alliance 
<br>
<br>This great elf ranger known as Alleria witnessed the destructive forces of the Horde when she was looking for her family among ashes of the old city of Quel’Thalas. 
<br>
<br>Her legendary hatred for the Orcs drove her in the land of Azeroth where she led elite troops of rangers to hunt Bleeding Hollow clan orcs. Sent in Draenor during the Third War, she supposely died, probably during its explosion, in year 606.
<br>
<br><b>Antonidas:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Archmage 
<br>Affiliation: The alliance 
<br>
<br>Antonidas ruled over Kirin Tor, a group of magicians who rule over the magic kingdom of Dalara, up to year 624. His health condition was getting worse, and he was forced not to leave his beloved city. His apprentice, Jaina Proudmoore, served him as eyes and ears in the vast outside world. Antonidas patiently waited the day he would transmit Jaina all her powers and responsabilities. Alas for him, this moment was rushed forward by the siege of Dalaran from Kel'Thuzad's armies. Even with the help of his apprentices, Antonidas could not stop the Scourge, and died from the hands of Arthas.
<br>
<br><b>Archimonde:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Demon 
<br>Affiliation: The Burning Legion 
<br>
<br>Archimonde was cold and brutal, but intelligent and wise. He had unlimited magic powers and incredible might. He dreamed of becoming a god and having powers as strong as Sargeras. 
<br>
<br>After centuries, he was ready to invade Azeroth. His mission was to invade in the name of Sargeras, but what Archimonde wanted the most was to keep all energies of this world for himself. That is what killed him: by going to close to Nordrassil, the World Tree, he didn't detect the trap: at the moment his feet touched the roots, ancient Ashenvale Guardians, called by Malfurion, massively attacked him and finally killed him.
<br>
<br><b>Arthas:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Paladin / Dark Knight 
<br>Affiliation: The Alliance / The Sourge 
<br>
<br>Arthas was the only son of the king Terenas. He was a young, idealist but unwise, man who dreamt to become the king of Lordaeron, as his father. He became a paladin at nineteen and was the favorite disciple of Uther Lightbringer. Arthas loved Uther as a member of his own family, and he only wanted to become a hero like the ones that fought the Horde during the Second War. 
<br>
<br>A day, he decided to hunt Mal’Ganis, Lord of Fear, in the cold lands of Northend. There, he took the risk to hold Frostmourne, the cursed weapon forged by Ner’zhul himself, the only weapon that could defeat Mal’ganis. The young Prince of Lordaeron succumbed to the influence of the blade: he walked days and nights in frozen stroms. He finally reached Icecrown and offered his soul to Ner’zhul. He became an anti-paladin and led the army of the Lich King. He destroyed Lordaeron and killed Antonidas and his father, King Terenas.
<br>
<br><b>Cairne Bloodhoof:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Chiefain 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>Mighty chiefain of the Tauren Bloodhoof clan, Cairne is a fearless warrior and a wise leader for his people. Even if he’s a bit old, he still has the valor and courage of twenty men. Cairne knew his clan was seriously threatened by wandering centaurs, and he hoped he could find a safe place to establish them. His people were protected by the help of Thrall and the new Horde during the attack of year 624. On the other hand, he revealed to the young warchief the existance of the Oracle of Kalimdor and its sanctuary, within the Peak of Stonetalon.
<br>
<br><b>Cho’gall:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Ogremagi 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>Member of the fifth circle of the Shodow Council and chief of the Twilight’s Hammer clan, Cho’gall was one of the most terrible and most respected chief of the Horde. He was one of the first Ogremagies in History. He learnt magic before Horde even invaded Azeroth. Gul’dan taught Cho’gall everything about evil energy. Cho’gall was sure his clan had a sacred mission: to annihilate every nation. He was killed on the orders of Doomhammer, just after he quitted the Horde to accomplish Gul’dan will.
<br>
<br><b>Danath:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Knight 
<br>Affiliation: The Alliance 
<br>
<br>Veteran mercenary of the Stormgarde milicia and hero of the Second War, Danath acquired a great leader reputation during the final battle of Khaz Modan. He lived for a while in New Stormwind, in Azeroth, as a supervisor of the prison camps where were held Orcs. Sent in Draenor, he disappeared when that world collapsed.
<br>
<br><b>Deathwing:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Unknown 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>Deathwing was one of the most feared being of the known world. During the Second War, alchemist dwarves covered the dragon with dark steel. The best became almost invulnerable. Since then, Deathwing took the head ofa renegade dragon force and settled at the summit of a mount located north-east of Draenor. In year 606, he was brought down by the forces of the Alliance.
<br>
<br><b>Dentarg:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Ogremagi 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>The Ogre-mage Dentarg was a good servant of Ner’zhul of the Shadow Moon Clan. He was called to rally of the unsubdued clans in war times. His job also consisted in making sure all clans were respecting the absolute autority of Ner’zhul. Maybe he succeeded in following his master through the portal at the end of the Third War. Nobody knows.
<br>
<br><b>Garona:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Assassin 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>Garona was born in Azeroth. She was captured by humans and saved from death because of her human side. However, she lived as a slave but escaped and joined the Horde. She served Gul'dan and was accepted in the Shadow Council as a translator and a very educated person. 
<br>
<br>Garona became Gul'dan's personal spy and assassin; he treated her like his daughter. She was involved in the death of king Llane and the destruction of Northshire abbey. When Gul'dan felt in a misterious deep sleep, Garona was captured by Doomhammer who wanted to know all the secrets of the Shadow Council. Tortured, she finally escaped for a second time and no one ever heard of her again.
<br>
<br><b>Grom Hellscream:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Blademaster 
<br>Affiliation: Orcish Horde 
<br>
<br>Chief of the Warsong Clan, Grom Hellscream was one of the mightiest Orcs of Draenor. He did not take part in the first invasion of Azeroth and served Ner'zhul when Humans entered Draenor for the first time. After his world's destruction, Grom was made prisonner of the Humans, in a hostile world he cursed. He was the first Orc to follow Thrall and to join the New Horde. He considered the young shaman like a brother, and did not hesitate a second to follow him across the Great Sea when Medivh called for help. 
<br>
<br>On one of these far away lands, Grom once again got corrupted by one the Legion's high commanders blood, Mannaroth. He was consumed with hatred and could only be saved with the help of Jaina and Thrall's might. In an helpless move some say, Grom died in a one-on-one combat against Mannoroth, but taking the demon with him to death.
<br>
<br><b>Gul'dan:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Sorcerer 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>Gul'dan was the sorcerer of the Inner Circle and the Annihilator of dreams. Even if he wasn't happy to plan the evil actions of the Horde, he chaired the mysterious Shadow Council. Once a disciple of Ner'zhul, he was initiated to Arcana magic by Kil'jaeden: he became one of the most powerful sorcerer to live in that temporal sphere. He was obsessed by the goal of finding the legendary tomb of Sargeras. He was thinking that if he could understand the writings on the tomb of the Lord of the Demons, he would acquire his powers for the eternity. 
<br>
<br>His black magic raised some special fighters for the Horde: Necrolyte, Ogremagies and Death Knights came from his colaboration with dark gods. Gul'dan was the orc that gathered all the clans and gave birth to the Horde by doing so. The Horde's first commander was BlackHand and the second was Doomhammer. Even if BlackHand was totally under his commands, Doomhammer had other plans... Gul'dan lost his position during some time, but with the help of the Cho'gall clan, he finally found the tomb. Unluckily, he only found death there; rumors said Sargeras was still alive, trapped in his tomb, and waiting to regain his strengh to launch another assault on the land.
<br>
<br><b>Illidan Stormrage:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Demon Hunter 
<br>Affiliation: N/A 
<br>
<br>During the dark times, before Ancients War, Illidan was one of the few magic user. Even if his older brother, Furion, warned him about the perverse influence of magic, Illidan continued to improve his magic knowledge. Bit by bit, the Night Elf lost his noble soul because of his dependancy to chaotic energies. After using his powers to help his borther against the demons of the Burning Legion, he finally betrayed its people when he allied with Azshara. After the war, Illidan summoned a new Moon well to make sure his beloved yet corrupting magic would never disappear from earth. Because of this action, Furion ordered that Illidan stay jailed under the surface for eternity. 
<br>
<br>Illidan was trapped during a very long time, maybe thousands of years. It is only in 624 that Tyrande freed him thinking that Night Elf could help her fight the demons. Wanting to proove his brother that he is still loyal to elves, Illidan killed all Felwood demons. 
<br>
<br>Manipulated by Arthas, the Demon Hunter used the powers of Gul'dan skull to destroy Tichondrius and his minions. He succeeded in killing the Lord of Nathrezim, but alas, the vicious powers of the skulls turned him into a demon. Later, Malfurion saw him under his new appearance, and Illidan was banned of Ashenvale. He was never seen again.
<br>
<br><b>Jaina Proudmore:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Archmage 
<br>Affiliation: The Alliance 
<br>
<br>One of Dalaran's best sorceress since many generations, Jaina is a curious and clever young woman who seeks to aquire more knowledge and magical powers. His father, Admiral Proudmore from Kul Tiras, was one of the heroes of the Second War. Jaina became famous because of his father, but his only wish was to follow the path of magic. 
<br>
<br>Like Arthas, she was deeply when they left each other. However, she never left her tears interfere with her studies or researches. Her master, Archman Antonidas, oftend said that she could became the greatest sorceress the world ever saw. Her role during the Burning Legion's invasion was very importan indeed, following Medivh's advices, she took the head of the Human Alliance who set afoot the lost continent of Kalimdor. Because of this, she helped defeat Archimonde with the help of the Orc Thrall, Furion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind.
<br>
<br><b>Kargath Bladefist:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Grunt 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>Kargath was always wearing a glove with sharp blades to replace his lost left hand. Its pitiless tenacity and its tactics were worth to him the rank of chief within the frightening Shattered Hand clan. Just like Hellscream, Kargath always released his troops on unprepared human armies for bloody victories. He died during the destruction of his own world, Draenor, fighting under Ner'zhul's will.
<br>
<br><b>Kel'Thuzad:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Necromancer/Lich 
<br>Affiliation: The Plague 
<br>
<br>Kel'Thuzad was one of the greatest archmagies of Dalaran. He was a member of Kirin Tor and a good friend of Antonidas. However, his desire of learning necromancy made him not very popular among other archmagies. Following Lich King's call, he travelled to Northrend and gave Ner'zhul his soul. The Lich King ordered him to create a cult that would help in raising a huge undead army. Kel'Thuzad used his powers and immense fortune to found the Cult of the Damned. That cult was obeying to Ner'zhul. 
<br>
<br>He participated in Northeron invasion with his undead army until he was stopped by Arthas, paladin of the Silver Hand. Once Arthas was at the lead of the Plague army, Kel'Thuzad's spirit warned the antepaladin of Nathrezims. Arthas procceded in a ritual in Quel'Thalas to bring Kel'Thuzad back to life as a lich, whose first act was to steal Medivh's spell book, in Dalaran's capital. Using the powerful spells contained in the book, he called upon Archimonde and summoned the Legion.
<br>
<br><b>Khadgar:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Archmage 
<br>Affiliation: The Alliance 
<br>
<br>Medivh’s apprentice, Khadgar became a great hero because of his legendary courage and all he did for Azeroth during the First War. In his quest for understanding the mysterious magic necessary to the creation of the Dark Door, Khadgar went to Dalaran. In there, he spoke with a strange character, named Kirin Tor, about origins of the Door. After the Second War, he went back in Azeroth to supervise researches in the ruins around the Door. Fearing another invasion, he ordered that Nethergarde castle should be built near the Black Swamp so that guards could study the fault. 
<br>
<br>Khadgar was the one that murdered Medivh, destroyed the first portal and died in Draenor, trying to contain destructive energy that could have been fatal to Azeroth.
<br>
<br><b>Kil'jaeden:</b> 
<br>
<br>Class: Warlock 
<br>Affiliation: The Burning legion 
<br>
<br>Kil'jaeden, Sargeras's champion, was assigned by his master the mission to corrupt all races of the Distorted Void. He was responsible of Nathrezim people's curse, and later, Orc's curse: Kil'jaeden taught Gul'dan the black arcanes and witchcraft that made the orcish horde sink in a sanguinary rage. 
<br>
<br>When Orcs failed during the Azeroth invasion, Kil'jaeden ordered Ner'zhul to prepare a third invasion with the help of the Plague. This powerful demon, even if he was reponsible for the Horde and Lich King's evil actions, he never landed a foot on Azeroth land.
<br> 
<br><b>Kurdran:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Griffon Rider 
<br>Affiliation: The Alliance 
<br>
<br>The proud dwarf Kurdran was one of the most famous hero of the Second war. 
<br>He killed by himself nince dragons and since then, Kurdran and his griffon 
<br>were the uncontested masters of the sky. During his mission in Draenor, he 
<br>faced the same destiny as Khadgar, Turalyon, Alleria and Danath: death.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by JustinJoseph ]<br></font></small>

								<b>Lothar:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Knight 
<br>Affiliation: The alliance (leader) 
<br>
<br>Raised in the kingdom of Azeroth, Anduin Lothar spend his whole life to serve the nation he considered his own. Proud and brave, Lothar soon became part of the King's guardiands. Several months later, he accepted the quest to find the Holy Book, an adventure from which he nearly died. As soon as the holy writings were back in Northshire's Church, Lothar took the head of Azeroth's armies and engaged against the Horde. After the devastation of Azeroth by the hored, and the king assassinated, Lothar brought his brothers back together and lead them to the safe shores of Lordaeron. 
<br>
<br>Lothar swore to avenge sooner or later his king and all his friends who died for the Alliance. During the second war, helped by Uther and admiral Daelin Proudmoore, he succeeded in bringing his troops to victory inpushing back Doomhammer's clans out of Lordaeron to the lands of Azeroth, controlled by Orcs. During the siege of Blackrock Spire, Lord Lothar was killed by Doomhammer himself who charged them from behind. His death was not in vain, since it brought his troups the rage they needed to make Blackrock Spire fall, and win the Second War.
<br>
<br><b>Malfurion Stormrage:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Keeper of the Grove 
<br>Affiliation: Sentinels 
<br>
<br>Furion was the first Night Elf to speak against Azshara and her minions adorating demons. With his brother Illidian and the demi-gof Cenarius, he lead wars against the Burning Legion during the Ancient's War. He was the first to step away from magic and lear druidic ways. Being the spiritual chief of the Night Elf for 10 000 years, he spent his life protecting the fragile culture of his elvish brothers, even during his spiritual journey to the Emerald Dream. Woke up by Tyrand during the Legion's third coming, he quickly organized a battle party against them and agreed to unite with Orcs and Humans. He took the decision to sacrifice the immortality of the Night Elves to defeat Archimonde indefinitely.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Mannoroth:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Abyss Lord 
<br>Affiliation: Burning Legion 
<br>
<br>Mannoroth was composed of pur hatred, tricks, and rage. He was the ultimate destroying machine; he would only kill and destroy. Some people think he had some vague link with Orc's corruption and taste for blood. Mannoroth waited centuries the moment he could come back and finish the work he started during the Ancient War. 
<br>
<br>During his Third Coming, he released his forces in Lordaeron before corrupting Kalimdor Orcs once again. Mannoroth didn't live long enough to see his demon brothers fall; he was killed by Grom Hellscream that, once released of all evil influence, wanted to avenge all Orcs.
<br>
<br><b>Medivh:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Sorcerer 
<br>Affiliation: None 
<br>
<br>Son of the conjurer Nielas Aran and Aegwyn, Medivh, the &quot;Guardian of the Secrets&quot;, is the last of the Tirisfal Guardians. Given phenomenal powers to his 12th birthday, he fell in a deep sleep from which he woke up only six years later. Alas for humanity, the young sorcerer was corrupted by the Burning Legion during his sleep. He started studying dark magic's arcanes and experimenting extra-corporal exploration. During one of these explorations in the outerworld, Medivh got incontact with Gul'dan, the oOrc Shaman, and promised him to reveal him the location of Sargeras' Tomb, if in return he would help him devastate Azeroth with the Horder. Even if the invasion did happen, Medivh didn't not feast from the victory. He was killed in year 600 from King Llane's expedition, and never could reveal Sargeras' location to Gul'dan. 
<br>
<br>No one knows what happened to him for over 20 years, neither what made him act this way, but Medivh walked back to the humans during the Legion's third coming. Sharing his great knowledge with the humans, Archimonde fell and the Orcs and Humans were united for the first time. Some say Medivh was last seen on the ruins of Ashenvale, but no one knows what he's become ...
<br>
<br><b>Muradin Bronzebeard:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: King of the Hill

<br>
<br>Muradin was one of the first dwarves to enter the Explorators Guild. This group was interested in archeology and the exploration of unknown world. Even if Muradin came back to Khaz Modan and Lordaeron only a few times, he supported the dwarven and human alliance. In 624, during a mission in Northrend, he helped Arthas in his quest by revealing him the existance of Frostmourne. Ironically, he's been the first victim of the fallen prince.

<br>
<br>Class: Warlock 
<br>Affiliation: The Burning Legion 
<br>

Corrupted by those demons, he lost faith in his task and destroyed all the hard work done by the other titans. He declared himself the kind of the Eredars and founded the Burning Legion. 
<br>
<br>During years he released the demons he had imprisoned himself. He destroyed Kalimdor during the First War and killed many soldiers in the Human army during the Second War. During this fight, Guardien Aegwyn killed the demon whose corpse was buried under Major Ocean.
<br>
<br><b>Teron Gorefiend:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Death Knight 
<br>Affiliation: The Scourge 
<br>
<br>Teron Gorefiend, once a faithful knight, became corrupted and was possessed by Orcs of Gorefiend. Since then, he planned to open his own portal from Draenor and create his own world. This evil Death Knight managed to see the magical nature of the portal and was said to discuss a trade with Nerz'hul about its secrets. No one knows what he became after the Third War, but it is rumored he flew Draenor before its destruction into a portal he created.
<br>
<br><b>Thrall:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Far Seer 
<br>Affiliation: Orcish Horde 
<br>
<br>Thrall is Durotan's son, Frostwolf Clan's chief, who was assassinated by Rend and Maim, Blackhand's children. Abandonned in snow, he was raised by Aedelas Blackmoore, a human commander, but Thrall ran away from him and hid with Grom Hellscream in his powerful Warsong Clan, around Mount Alterac, where he received a shaman training. With Doomhammer's help and his master Drek'Thar, Thrall freed many Orc prisonners from Human camps and formed the New Horde. 
<br>
<br>When his army was fully organized again, Thrall lead them across the Great See following Medivh's advice, and contributed to free Azeroth from the Burning Legion.
<br>
<br><b>Tichondrius:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Nathrezim demon 
<br>Affiliation: The Burning Legion 
<br>
<br>Tichondrius was the Lord of Fear. He liked shadow and torture. Even if he always obeyed his master, Kil'Jaeden, he didn't like watching the Lich King, Ner'zhul. He thought that Lich King was going to betray the Burning Legion. 
<br>
<br>Tichondrius was a good soldier. He was looking for power and conquests, but he was always completing his missions with care and precision. He was killed by Illidan Stormrage while he was watching Legion's activities in Felwood. He was replaced by Anetheron.
<br>
<br><b>Turalyon:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Paladin 
<br>Affiliation: The Alliance 
<br>
<br>Turalyon was one of the first knights of Lordaeron to be promoted as a paladin by Uther Lightbringer. He believed in the Order by maintaining a very strict military discipline. However, his friends and foes always showed him great respect. Turalyon was fighting with the troops Lothar sent in the Black Rock Spire trap. He was sad he couldn't have saved this great knight. On Draenor, he helped Khadgar to destroy the Dark Portal, but he disappear soon after. 
<br>
<br><b>Tyrande Whisperwind:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Priestess of the Moon 
<br>Affiliation: Sentinels 
<br>
<br>Tyrande is an ancient Night Elf princess and Grand Priestess of the Goddess of the Moon, Elune. In the past, she helped Furion and Illidan in their combat to save Kalimdor from the Burning LEgion. She is not only the Elunes Grand Priestess, but also the chief of the Sentinels, a group of Night Elf warriors that swore to protect the shores of Kalimdor while Night Elf's druidic males sleep in the Emerald Dream. 
<br>
<br>Tyrande is a great warrior indeed, but she hardly accepts having to defend the land while druids are sleeping. Her ternal love for Furion gave her strenght and courage nedded to face long years alone defending Kalimdor. During the third coming, she did not enjoy the Orc's and Human's invasion into Kalimdor, but still got to trust them. Proud and determined, Tyrande fought bravely at the foot of the World Tree to prevent Archimonde's advance.
<br>
<br><b>Uther Lightbringer:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Paladin 
<br>Affialiation: The Alliance 
<br>
<br>Uther started as bishop Alinsus Faol's apprentice, the same bishop who was at the head of the Sacred Clergy Order of Northshire and who gave spiritual forces to humans during the First War. That man knew pretty well that faith alone was futile against the heinous Horde. A lot of people died during the First War and Uther, aware of the situation, knew spiritual weapons would not be strong enough to repel the Horde and protect the people. Uther called all the best knights of Lordaeron, and all together, they formed the Knights of the Silver Hand Order. 
<br>
<br>With the help of all those paladins and assisted of Lothar, Uther exterminated the orc presence in Lordaeron. He became one of the best and famous warrior of Human history. After the Second War, Uther tried to keep peace on his kingdom while taking care of his apprentice, Arthas, who will later kill his mentor while under the influence of the Lich King
<br>
<br><b>Zuljin:</b>
<br>
<br>Class: Berserker 
<br>Affiliation: The Horde 
<br>
<br>The fame of this unfair troll and fear of all exceeded the borders of its territory. He was particularly famous for his spectacular against elf towns. Zuljin gathered many clans of trolls, some nomads, some warriors, and in 604, he was at the head of a big and united army. Other trolls had an infinite admiration for their chief, and were ready to follow him blindly. When Elves and trolls felt the everlasting war so close and the conflict was more and more important, Zuljin understood the only solution to keep the rest of his people alive was to ally them with the Horde. Since then, Orgrim Doomhammer had axe thrower in his own army. It is unknown what happened to Zuljin after; he disappeared during the Second War.

								<b>:: Warcraft History</b>  
<br>
<br>Here is a relatively short summary of what happened in the World of Warcraft since its creation in year -10000. This information is based on some official timeline released some time ago. Hopefully this will help you figure out what is going to happen next! 
<br>
<br><b>Creation of the World:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year -10,000</b>:
<br>The Night Elves emerged in Kalimdor. Throughout their existence they have meddled with primitive magic, but not always with great success; in fact, through their attempts they accidentally let loose the demonic Burning Legion upon the world of Azeroth. The result is a massive war between the Night Elves and burning demons, in which the Night Elves are forced to form an alliance with the ancestral Dragons, which results in an apocalyptic conflict. Much of the continent of Kalimdor is devastated and sinks under the Great Sea. Alt hough the Burning Legion killed most of the Night Elves, the ones that survived vowed never again to use the ancient magic. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -6,000</b>:
<br>Unwilling to live without magic, a rogue band of Night Elves is banished from Kalimdor. They travel to the newly formed Eastern lands where they find the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and developed a new society we now refer to as High Elves. They have a very hard time avoiding skirmishes and raids by the local Troll tribes. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -2,900</b>:
<br>Several thousand years pass, the Human Empire if Arathor is developing in Lordaeron. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -2,700</b>:
<br>The High Elves are on the verge of losing everything to the Trolls. In a last fight for survival, they agreed to ally with the Humans and to teach them magic in exchange for help against the Trolls. The combined armies of Humans and Elves succeeded in sweeping out most of the Trolls. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -2,600</b>:
<br>However, a price was to be paid. The Humans showed little respect for the magic they have learned, and once again Burning Legion's armies are attracted to the World by the magical forces. The Order of Tirisfal is founded several years later. They become the guardians of the world against the Legion, although their Order is shrouded in secrecy and the general population knows nothing of them. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -1,200</b>:
<br>Inflicted by several conflicts, The Human empire of Arathor is divised into seven individual nations: Azeroth, Lordaeron, Stormgarde, Kul Tiras, Gilneas, Dalaran and Alterac. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -45</b>:
<br>Guardian Aegwynn defeats Sargeras, the Burning Legion's Lord, in a one-on-one combat. The tormented soul of Sargeras ties itself to Aegwynn's future child. 
<br>
<br><b>Year -40</b>:
<br>Although they are eventually banished from Azeroth by the Order of Tirisfal, the Burning Legion corrupts the Orcish clans on the world of Draenor. A once noble, shamanistic Orc society is quickly transformed into a vicious Horde, ruled by the malevolent Shadow Council. These powerful learn the basics of Dark Magic from the demonic invaders, such as Gul'dan who is possessed by Kil'jaeden (Sargeras' apprentice) 
<br>
<br><b>Year -37</b>:
<br>Aegwynn gives birth to his child, Medivh, who's destined to becoming the last of the Gardians. However, she gives him all of her powers and knowledge and seals it deep inside him so that he would only use it when he becomes an adult. 
<br>
<br><b>Year 1</b>:
<br>Medivh, fouled by Saergeras' soul, contacts Gul'dan in a thirst of conquest. He opens the Dark portals, and the Horde begins invading Azeroth. 
<br>
<br><b>Warcraft: Orc and Humans:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year 5</b>:
<br>Medivh is killed by his best friend, Lord Lothar, and his apprentice Khadgar. During the last 4 years, the Horde was successful in conquering Azeroth and Khaz Modan, and established themselves in Blackroc Spire as their primary base. 
<br>
<br>Lord Lothar leads a group of refugees to the northern lands of Lordaeron, where he is successful in reuniting the 7 Human nations to fight the Horde. This new alliance will be remembered as the Alliance of Lordaeron. 
<br>
<br><b>Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year 6</b>:
<br>Orgrim Doomhammer, the Horde's Warchief, launches his huge fleet to invade the coasts of Lordaeron by see. They invade the land up to its core and destroy Quel'Thalas, kingdom of the High Elves. 
<br>
<br>The Alliance succeeds in pushing them back, but Lothar is killed during the siege of Blackrock Spire. The Human armies bring Blackrock Spire to dust and push back the Horde to the vicinity of the Dark Portal. 
<br>
<br>The Dark Portal is destroyed and the Horde is no more. 
<br>
<br><b>Year 7</b>:
<br>Remaining Orcs are captured and jailed in the Alliance's keeps.
<br>
<br><b>Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year 8</b>:
<br>Ner'zhul, an Orcish shaman, brings together the remaining clans in Draenor and opens the Dark Portal. He orders his armies to steal many of Azeroth's artifacts in order to open multiple portals in Draenor. 
<br>
<br>The Alliance sends his men, lead by the sorcered Khadgar, beyond the Dark Portal to stop Ner'zhul's plans. The two armies fight in the infernal world of Draenor for months. 
<br>
<br>Strengthened by the stolen artifacts, Ner'zhul opens many more Portals in Draenor in a hope to invade the Human world. However, before he can send his troops through, he losses control over their energy which begins sweeping away Draenor's life force. The heroes of the Alliance, knowing they would be imprisoned there forever, are forced to destroy the Dark Portal to save Azeroth from the infernal energy. 
<br>
<br>Draenor is devastated. 
<br>
<br><b>Year 9</b>:
<br>The Alliance once again heals and the Orcish are once again jailed in keeps. Only a few Orc clans can escape and they hide in wild plains. 
<br>
<br><b>Thrall's Tale : Lord of the Clans:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year 22</b>:
<br>Thrall, a young Orc raised as a slave and human gladiator, escapes and begins his quest to discover his lost ancestral history. Thrall reunites a small group of clans and leads them to stand up against the guardians of the Alliance. 
<br>
<br><b>Year 23</b>:
<br>With the growing threat of a new Horde, once again the Alliance is struct by internal conflicts between the leaders. 
<br>
<br>Thrall becomes the new Warchief of the Horde and introduces back the lost shaman culture to his troops. The Horde, renewed with this new strength, looses the last scars of the corruption that were caused by the Burning Legion. 
<br>
<br>A civil war between the Human nations threatens their very existence at the very moment the Burning Legion returns to their world … 
<br>
<br><b>Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year 39</b>:
<br>A hard earned peace is established since the war ended. Hoever, while the Human kingdoms are still blinded by their past victories, the Orcish clans slowly unite to a young promising chief. 
<br>A shadow even darker is born, threatening to remove all life from the World. A war begins once again, as the inevitable hour of Chaos draws near. When the sky rains fire, the world will tremble to the might of the Burning Legion. 
<br>
<br><b>World of Warcraft:</b>    
<br>
<br><b>Year 45</b>:
<br>Four years passed since the end of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. The conflicts that once nearly destroyed the world of Azeroth are no more. Every race, weakened by war, begin the building of a new Kingdom. However, an ancient and forgotten power is about to be brought to the surface once more...
