<br>
<br>DragonSword, what about quest items? It's conceivable that most of the really good items will come from questing. If a quest-related item doesn't drop because the pool is getting low, players will get angry, and you'll end up having the &quot;camping&quot; effect from Everquest: people sitting in a spot, killing the Trolls over and over until the eventual- now rare- loot drops.
<br>
<br>So, in an attempt to minimize the influx of new items, you have to create a timesink (i.e. camping) to stop people from overdrawing the Ice Troll pool.
<br>
<br>I honestly don't know what the reasonable solution here is.

								 Wow 12 hours ago this thread had 107 replies now it's up to 122.  I like BananaRebelions ideas on the Rouge Pickpocket pools.  I think that maybe items stolen should be listed that they are a stolen version of it.  For example a rouge might steal a &quot;stolen silverleaf&quot; or a &quot;stolen goblin tooth&quot; the stolen item would have the same value and effect as the real item the only difference is it wouldn't be able to stack with the real item and also make it easier for Blizzard to keep track of the stolen items.  As to the money having a different &quot;Isotope&quot; of it would make it hard to keep track if it was stackable and having different stacks of it would seem a bit awkward.  So maybe the money for the rogue steal pool could represent appoximatly 3% of the NPC treasury and to be replenished on next update from the treasury keeping it in balance with the &quot;M&quot; equations; sorry I am not a mathmation like DragonSword.  
<br>
<br>As to the other subject at hand; item decay would definatly be useful for keeping the economy in balance, and would also be cool in the least.  I have also heard that Blizzard Entertainment announced that there wouldn't be item decay in the game but I know anything and everything that has been announced about this game is subject to change.  With the items and equipment getting better and replacing old items does seem like a good idea in some aspects.  The problem with it though is that the game would continually get easier and thus more boring.  The only way to avoid this would be to update the monsters so they are tougher.  Then you create another problem: why update the equipment at all?  I personally like the other idea of having some weapons more effective against certain monsters than others.  For example a flail for crushing would be more effective against a skeleton than a dagger for peircing.  Those are my thoughts for on these subjects.

<br>My idea was that quest rewards would be separate from ordinary mob drops. Game Masters will set up quests available from certain NPCs, and will set up appropriate quest structures and quest rewards. Most quests will be repeatable, and from time to time older quests will be removed (in the sense that NPCs will no longer offer them to new players). While on a quest players will have to fight their way through normal monsters, and will receive drops based on loot pools available to monsters killed.
<br>
<br>At various stages in a quest, and especially at the end of a quest, players will also meet NPC characters that have been created specifically by the Game Master as part of the quest. These characters will have a unique appearance and name and will have dialogue to deliver to the questing players etc. and they will hold special quest rewards including currency and special items. These items and currency will be taken directly from a nearby Key NPC Stronghold and provided to the questing players, and there will be no “formula” interfering with whether you get the quest rewards or not.
<br>
<br>The NPC strongholds that hold quest reward loot pools will be pretty well stocked (20% of all NPC wealth) and shouldn’t really run dry unless something quite strange is happening. If the loot stored in a NPC stronghold is starting to run dry, and it’s not time for Treasury to replenish it yet, then some quests that offer rewards from that loot pool may not be offered any longer by relevant NPCs. If you already have the quest in your log book you can still complete it and get the rewards. This should hopefully prevent any players from being disappointed.
<br>
<br>By the way, I don't think your discussion of the way items will be handled in the WoW economy is off topic at all. It's really just as important as the way currency works, and I hope we discuss it some more. Your point of view is interesting because you come from an Everquest background and know about how economic problems were handled in that game.

<br>Haha, I'm not that good at maths really. I actually have problems with differentiation. I don't think you need to know all that much about maths to make up economic theories for games though. :)

<br>That’s kind of what I'm thinking at the moment too. It sounds a lot like inflation, except in this case its a cycle of inflation of item usefulness, and inflation of average mob power. I don't like inflation much, as you will see from my previous posts, and would personally like to find a way to avoid it in the game world if possible.

								Great thread going here with LOTS of well thought out ideas.  Unfortunately, you HAVE to make pickpocketing have a separate pool.  I know in EQ rogues were shunned BIG TIME at low levels because they could pick a monster clean and get all the money before the mob was dead.  Giving a class a skill that makes them LESS desirable in groups is a majorly bad idea.  Anyway, great thread and keep the great ideas coming.

								Thanks for your comments Bannas! I just want to clear up what JRavey and I meant by putting the pickpocket loot pool with the other NPC mob loot pool(s). There will be a BIG lootpool that covers all NPC mobs and characters and NPC vendors other that the top level &quot;Key&quot; NPCs like Kings. 
<br>
<br>Then there will be lots of smaller lootpools that feed out of this, and some of them will relate specifically to loot for pickpocketing various monsters and groups of NPCs. I can see the obvious problems that would result if the rogue in a party got all the good loot from a monster before it died, then the other players got nothing. 
<br>
<br>Basically the rogue would be creamed by the other party members, or expelled from the party or whatever - too sad. :(

								I guess I figured DragonSword was good at math because of the equation system he proposed.  I understand it but I am not very good at adding to it or appling it very effectivly.  It is a very good system though.
<br>
<br>I was thinking about the quests and if the stronghold ran out of money.  So if the stronghold is running low it will no longer offer the quest until it is refreshed.  The people who have the quests already would still be able to do the quest and get the rewards.  The problem then is if the stronghold doesn't have the money to pay all of the people who do have the quest.  The only way I can think of to combat the problem is by calculating how much money is in the stronghold and set a number of quests given out.  Once the pre-detemined number of quests is given out the NPCs will stop offering the quests.  The next problem is about the people who had the quests before the stronghold is refreshed.  When the Stronghold is refreshed it could also calculate the money required to pay the people who had the quest from before.  Then we have another problem eventually there will be people who never finish the quest and the strongholds will eventually have money in reserve for the people who haven't finished the quests causing server wide bankrupcy.  The best way I can think of to combat the final problem is by making a time limit to complete the quests.  
<br>
<br>To avoid serverwide bankrupcy caused by unfinished quests, there would have to be a time limit to complete the quest.  There are many different ways that this can be done.  For every estimated hour(play time) it takes to finish the quest they will have one day(real time) to complete the quest.  If a quest has an estimated 3 hours to complete then that character would have 3 days to finish it or they would have to get it again.  The other way I thought of putting a time limit on a quest is by making a time value in relation to play time rather than real time.  I was thinking maybe they could have 3 times to complete the quest than it is estimated to finish.  The problem with the first one is that what if someone went out of town or something and when they got back the quest was expired.  The problem with the latter is that if that player quit playing that character the quest will still be flagged on that character until the character was deleted.  I prefer the first solution myself; someone else might be able to think of different solutions.  When a person fails to complete a quest in the time alloted they can get the quest again from the original NPC and continue where they left off so long as the limit is not reached and the quest hasn't recently been flagged as obsolete.  One last thing; when a person fails to complete a quest in time aloted the NPC should now be able to give out the quest one more time as there will now be ample rewards for one more person to do the quest.

								Hmmmm.  Lots of ideas floating around and many subjects getting discussed at once.  I'm actually getting a little confused. I really don't have much to say except for my opinion on item decay.  I think items should not decay.  Item decay throws a whole loop into the entire system and makes things real hairy.  It would be much easier if an item is worth the same thing no matter how long you have had it.  It's just easier when things are held constant in economics.  Wouldn't you agree?  Anyways, maybe when I think of something else to say I will post back.  I've got to understand what everyone is talking about first.  :D
<br>
<br>P.S. - I)ragonSword, is differentiation a part of calculus?

								I think that item decay is a must....

<br>It will keep smiths and miners in buisness and it will make sure taht really good items are rare since they will eventually dissapear.
<br>
<br>Edit: (forgot to address a few things)
<br>
<br>JR and Screes discussion:
<br>
<br>What we found out so far in this discussion is that its hard to find a good solution, but I could compare this problem to some &quot;first-person shooter&quot; (FPS) games. For example Halo and counter-strike only allow you to carry two guns at the same time. And to get a new gun, you would have to throw one of your current weapons away to pickup a new and perhaps better gun. 
<br>
<br>Maybe WoW could have a similar system to make sure some quests arent harvested constantly for the good item rewards. Now lets say you can only have 2 weapons at any one time in WoW. (2 is just as an example, not a recommendation)
<br>
<br>I have my 2 weapon slots full with one &quot;fire sword&quot; and one &quot;Elven Bow&quot;. Suddenly one of my friends tell me about this new cool quest with awesome item reward. 
<br>
<br>I find out that at first in the quest, I will be attacked by many flying reptiles (or something airborne atleast). And in the end I will have to kill a great big Fire-Dragon. Now I know that a &quot;Fire Sword&quot; wont be much good against a fire-dragon, but that it would be much easier to outdamage the dragon using a &quot;Ice Sword&quot;.
<br>
<br>So to get hold of one of these &quot;Ice Swords&quot;, I could either:
<br>
<br>1) Go to some NPC trader, and trade/sell my &quot;Fire Sword&quot; for a &quot;Ice Sword&quot; or for enough money to buy one.
<br>
<br>2) The above, but with another player instead of with an NPC.
<br>
<br>3) Kill some monster and get a &quot;Ice Sword&quot; loot, which would force me to drop the &quot;Fire Sword&quot; because I will need my &quot;Elven Bow&quot; for the first part of the Quest.
<br>
<br>Now either way, I will have gotten rid of my &quot;Fire Sword&quot;, either by giving it back to the loot pool (Dropping it/selling to NPC). Or passing it on to another player (selling/trading with another player). This way the weapons would circle around and sometimes go back into the NPC pools.
<br>
<br>Once the quest is done I get some great loot, and if that loot is a weapon I would have to drop either my bow or my sword to pick it up. 
<br>
<br>This system would be able to prevent certain good items rewards, to get over-harvested, simply because no-onw would be able to pick up more than the weapon slots allow, and you would probably want some variation in your weaponry anyways.
<br>
<br>But it would be a somewhat cnotroversial way, and if you spend 20 hours to get one weapon, you might have to drop it the next day because you would need something else just temporarily.

								I haven't read all the posts in this thread so I don't know if my idea has already been suggested.  So here goes...
<br>
<br>It's very simple.  Just don't make the vendor prices static.  In the real world owners of buisinesses are constantly changing their prices acording to what people are willing to pay.  Players in games do the same thing.  In Diablo 2, what would be worth one SOJ one week could be two the next week or even 1/2.  A bad economy doesn't come from gold loseing it's value.  It comes from vendors not compensating for that loss of value.
<br>
<br>Lets say there is a Flaming Sword of Bad Guy Killing for sale at a local vendor.  The price of that sword is 14,000 gold.  Lets say that it is fairly priced.  Sure it's a little high but it's a nice sword and people are willing to pay that much.  So what happens when, later on down the road, gold becomes more common and 14,000 gold is chunk change to any lvl 5 character?  If the vendor doesn't change his prices to match the new value of gold, then not only does the gold lose its value but so does the sword.  However, if the vendor changes his prices and revalues the sword at 60,000 the only thing lost is the value of gold.  And who really cares about that.  The sword is still the same value and it's still just as easy or difficult to obtain it.  Back in the day a candy bar might cost a nickel but minimum wage was 25 cents an hour.  A candy bar today at 50 cents is no more expensive than it was back in the day when it only cost 5 cents.  The value is still the same.
<br>
<br>So in short, the trick is not to try to control the value of gold but instead to control the value of items.  Who cares if a piece of armor costs 100 gold or 100,000 gold as long as it is sold for what it is worth.
<br>
<br>The thing with this method is that it gets kind of complicated.  You have to know the economy to know how much an item is worth.  What a Sword of Ice that is commonly found in the Dwarven homelands is worth in one place may be worth more or less somewhere else in the world.  Blizzard would have to hire an accountant/economist and incorporate software into that game that would give that person information need to adjust prices.  I figure if they can pay for GMs they can pay for an accountant/economist.  I'd be willing to pay and extra dollar a month for a good stable economy.
<br>
<br>Ok.  This post has gone on long enough.  Give me your feedback.

<br>
<br>Unfortunately, limiting the number of items you can carry has always been a pain, because it ends up benefitting those with multiple accounts and multiple characters, along with big guilds that can support them. This skews the power curve in the game towards those with money in real life, which is obviously something Blizzard wouldn't want to promote.
<br>
<br>Muling and item camping is a fact of life in MMORPGs. The only way to stop it is to have:
<br>
<br>1. Limited supplies - This was mentioned before, where only a certain number of a quest can be performed before &quot;running out&quot;, and then take a while before being replenished. Unfortunately, this would cause &quot;quest camping&quot;, in my opinion. In other words, people would wait around the good quest givers and keep clicking until they are replenished.
<br>
<br>2. Random rewards - This is actually an interesting idea, one that Blizzard is implementing in their quest system. If you're not guaranteed to get item X as a reward for a quest, then maybe this will reduce the number of times item X is dropped, and stop people from going to the same quest giver. Unfortunately, this might also mean people trying to replay the same quest until item X does indeed, become a reward, unless there's a different reward pool per person for each quest (i.e. truly random).
<br>
<br>3. Item decay - This works in theory, but in reality, people will just hoard the good items without using them, so that they can sell them in &quot;prime&quot; condition (See: Ultima Online, DAOC). So you end up having easy-to-get items used because they eventually get destroyed in gameplay and are easy to replace, and very few of the really good items used at all.
<br>
<br>4. Introduce better items - This is the system I've been advocating in this thread. If there's a constant influx of new quests and goods, people won't be satisfied to sit on a single quest and do it over, knowing there's the possibility of something better out there. It promotes exploration (&quot;what if there's something better?&quot;), less hoarding (&quot;I'm not gonna get 50 of these because they won't be used that much in 6 months&quot;), and general game improvement.

<br>
<br>That would work out if most items were purchased  from an NPC vendor, rather than bought from another player or obtained via quest. Unfortunately, most powerful items in these games are traded and sold from player to player, and it is this player economy that sets the value of items- just as, in your example, SOJs have been used as a valuation tool for players in Diablo II.
<br>
<br>The point is, currency by itself has no inherent value. Its only value stems from its ability to be exchanged for tangible goods. No matter what price you set on an NPC vendor for that Sword of Ice, it only matters how much that Sword would be sold for to another player.
<br>
<br>The dilemma here is: how do you keep monetary association with goods relatively direct. Or, in other words, how do you make it so gold is worth something on the player market for actual goods. The reasonable answer to this is to make the difficulty of attaining a said amount of gold equal to the difficulty of attaining the item. So if you want Sword of Fire to cost 5,000 gold, you would want to make 5,000 gold as difficult to obtain as that Sword of Fire.
<br>
<br>This brings us back to DragonSword's original system of keeping gold and items in a treasury, or trackable pool. Each item needs to have an inherent value set by the game designers and economy, and gold needs to be dished out in amounts that follow that model. If they can control how quickly gold goes into (and out of) the system, they can fundamentally affect its rate of accumulation by players in relation to the frequency of items that drop.
<br>
<br>In theory...

								Really good comments Scree!
<br>
<br>An actual way to stop people from camping quests, would be to allow them to only do it once.... So when a PC has completed the quest and gotten the item/reward, they wont be able to get the same quest again.
<br>
<br>Now if this system would be implemented, people would and could not camp quests. But offcourse a quest system like this would need no item decay. 
<br>
<br>Actually how you explaind what item decay does really makes sense. I want to use my really good weapon and not save for something cool which could happen eventually. However, there shold still be some kind of need to reapair a weapon or an item once every while, to make sure that blacksmiths have something to doo.
<br>
<br>Anyways what do you think that limiting quests to a one-time only mission would do? It would definantly stop quest camping thats for sure, and taht would in turn lead to players exploring the world for new quests. I really cant see anything bad about limiting the quest use to 1 time per quest :)

								Ummm.  Actually, according to Blizzard, quests that have special quest item rewards cannont be done again once they have been completed.  However, there are some minor quests that can be repeated such as delivering mail to an NPC or gathering materials for a blacksmith.  These quests only give rewards such as gold or little &quot;ingredient items&quot; (herbs, metals, potions, etc.)  So, I think that wraps up this little discussion about quests.  :D<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by BananaRebellion ]<br></font></small>

<br>Diverse items are very important, but you will still have multiple grades of the same item. I don't think it would be logistically feasible for every single item to be unique in some way- so concessions are made to have &quot;classes&quot; of items- say, swords- which perform the same function at different levels. And there will invariably be a &quot;best&quot; item in a class. 
<br>
<br>My solution is to introduce a slightly better &quot;best&quot; item to transition people away from hoarding/desiring one single item in a class, while at the same time expiring, or bringing back into the treasury, older items that aren't ever really used. 
<br>
<br>As for Decay: it is fairly good as a money sink, as long as it's not too expensive. The problem is, how do you determine decay rates. Mages will rarely be &quot;hit&quot; by monsters, so will their armor not decay? Doesn't that seem unfair to melee classes who have to constantly repair their armor? Furthermore, if it's not expensive enough, it just becomes a nuisance at higher levels and doesn't really dent the coffers, so-to-speak. This is probably the reason Blizzard decided against it. 
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>Well I wasnt thinking about every item being totally unique but concider how blizzard added normal peircing magic seige etc damage into WCIII you cant just mass one thing and win it all depends.  So if blizz took this concept and expanded on it then yes like you said there is always going to be top items but with a larger variaty you should have at least a handfull of &quot;best&quot; items instead of just one that everyone wants.
<br>Yes it would be tough to determine decay rate but I think it would be well worth it if they got it down right, imo of course. I dont think it would be unfair for a warrior to have to repair more often or at least put more money into it (&lt;-- get to that later) because while the warrior puts his cash into armor etc a mage is putting the most of it into items needed for spells and other things that mages use are often very expensive so this might just help to even things out.  I too dont think its good to alway have to go back to repair but theres ways around this, double or even triple the durability and at the same time double or triple and instead of what I suggested before (having the base durability amount decrease) just add another number to the armor --- Leather armor has 3 repairs left... last, I guess price isnt my main concern here I think it would be fine to have it @ a fair price for the smith but not that big of a deal to the customer... this would just be another part of the whole money sink system, in fact its WAY easier to think of different money sinks then to think of item sinks.
<br>Oh and one more thought on the mage decay rate... I mentioned ealier that lets say a ring of +1 defence is being used it decays over time (only while its being used not while in town or something) you could apply this to say a mage cloak... give it a &quot;magic defense&quot; or anything useful to a mage and then he will have to go to someone to recharge it, basically the same thing that a worrior would do but with magic instead of steal, just a though *shrug*
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>
<br>from BannanaRebellion 
<br>think items should not decay. Item decay throws a whole loop into the entire system and makes things real hairy.  It would be much easier if an item is worth the same thing no matter how long you have had it.
<br><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>Do you mean as far as say selling your item to a shop, if so blizz could just lower the price a bit to help cover repair costs and that way  it would alway be worth the same thing. 
<br>

<br>
<br>Hmm. If all the good items come from quests that can only be done once, then people won't wish to part with said items, and they obviously can't hoard. However, over time those items get replaced with better quest items, and they'll end up being sold in the player economy, which is a good thing. 
<br>
<br>Seems like a fair answer to me. Only worry is that if you lose a special item you got from an epic quest, you can't get it again. But I think that's a fair trade-off. And, of course, hopefully there'll be enough of these types of quests that people won't exhaust all of them quickly.
<br>
<br>Blizzard might yet pull this one off.

<br>
<br>i never thought of that i like it, now i dont think limiting them that harshly i think more like 2 item 'sets'
<br>
<br>EX: a char has dual weild so it could hold 4 melee weapons in its inventory, and 2 ranged, that kind of thing, this way these temporary changes dont happen to effect you so harshly and still give players the ability to auction off their last weapon (in a bazarr or something if implemented)
<br>
<br>ok maybe 2 'sets' might be to harsh with no ezily accesable Bazarr type system

<br>i dont know why but i really like your idea

								After reading the posts in this thread (in which my head was swimming in equations), I came to realize... you guys have way to much time on your hands. But alas, you are right in your calculations. However, you have overlooked a few things. One such thing is that as an Multiplayer Online Game, you cannot have limiations, nor can you have a system that is mainly based on one particular economic solution.
<br>
<br>I would like to propose my own view to look at. It's not an monetary equation, but more of an observation on how the economy would operate in a typical fashion. Yes, I know there will be several people who will disagree with what I am about to write.
<br>
<br>First off, take off the ideas of a Treasury, a limited number of items, etc.
<br>Money and items (equipment, quest items, other loot) are not limited in how much can exist at one exact time. The number of items on a particular server can be endless. That gets rid of the worries of someone cornering a particular market based on particular item.
<br>Next, lets look at vendors. Vendors themselves have the ability to sell a pre-generated list of items. This list cannot change, and will contain some form of normal items that are used by players as equipment or consumed itesms. Thus you have one vendor who would sell swords as his pre-generated list type, and another who would sell gems as his pre-generated list type. Next, add in the ability for each vendor to accept (buy) items from players. When the vendor buys this item, it is added to another list on the vendor, we will call it the Temporary Stock. It is called temporary because each time the server is reset or brought down for maintainance, all information about this stock is reduced to zero (which effectively takes out items in the economy). Now the key thing about vendors is that they sell low-grade items in terms of equipment (the more valuable armors and weapons would be obtained through other means), however, they would be the primary source of various other necessities. This could come in the guise of BASE items required for tradeskills (such as a vial, a spit, a flask, or a bowl) or the guise of REAGENTS (in which are instantly consumed when the spell is successfully cast). Add to the fact that there would be different types of consumables (you would have higher grade/quality items for higher skills and spells) and that you would need to buy some of these in bulk. Since these items would mainly be supplied by vendors, it would make these items extremely hard to find in other means. However, what about the other items, such as armor and weapons (and various other equipment).
<br>Well, these items would serve as the basis of the player-run portion of the economy. Lets start off be adding the fact that not all creatures will drop some type of loot. Thus, there is already an edge on the amount of items coming into the world (as opposed to a game like Diablo 2). Next, lets add the fact that there will not always be items useful to a particular character, and not everyone will horde items just to sell them to another player. So many of those items would go to vendors (into their Temporary Stock) while provide the player with meager cash (adding a miniscule portion of money into the economy). However, some creatures will drop weapons or armor. Depending on the quality of the said armor or weapons (which can range from store-bought, sub-store-bought, and above store-bought) would determine the economic value to players. A low grade items that is less in effectiveness than, say, the lowest sword availible in the vendor's inventory would automatically be considered as vendor loot (in which the player sells, adding to the Temporary Stock again, and recieves a small portion of money) or intended to rot on the corpse of the monster. The average weapons could be looted and sold as well, but they would most likely stay on a corpse to rot as well. While the above standard items (mainly the magical ones and player-created items) would have a different role.
<br>The key thing to realize in a player-run system is that not everything is desireable. There are some things people want more than others. That is also limited to what people can afford. I will set up an example.
<br>
<br>There are four total players:
<br>Bob, who is selling a Keen Longsword (he is asking for 100 gold).
<br>John, who is looking to buy a better sword (but only has 75 gold), but has an Enhanced Club (which he wants to sell for 25 gold).
<br>Jane, who has 25 gold and wants to buy a better weapon.
<br>Davis, who has a Shortsword of Might and a Keen Dagger (which he is selling for 75 gold and 15 gold, respectively). However, he has 150 gold in his pocket, and himself is looking for a better weapon.
<br>
<br>Bob auctions off his sword for 100 gold. John, being the first to see that Bob is selling a weapon he wants realizes he only has 75 gold, but if he sells his club, he can get the sword. So he auctions off his club. About this time, Jane comes up and sees that John is selling his club (a better weapon than the one she has currently), however, she doesn't want a blunt weapon (either by choice, or by class restriction, etc.). However, Davis shows up and see's Bob's auction and buys the sword. Davis buys the sword, and puts up his newly-replaced sword for sale. John sees this new sword up for sale and sees that it is 75 gold, the same amount that he has, so John goes to buy that sword instead. However, he wants to buy a meal or two for health, so he still wants to sell his club. Davis, seeing as he had no trouble selling his current item, decides to sell the dagger he had in his backpack. Jane sees the dagger, which she can use, and chooses to buy it. Everyone, except John, is satisfied with their transactions and they decide to leave. However, John realizes after awhile that his club isn't selling, so he decides to leave.
<br>
<br>So, in the end results:
<br>Bob sold his sword and made 100 gold.
<br>John didn't sell his club, but still bought a sword that he could use, even though it isn't what he wanted.
<br>Jane bought her new dagger, and still has 10 gold that she can spend or save up.
<br>Davis, being the excellent businessman he is, sold both of his weapons, and obtained a new weapon, and has 140 gold.
<br>
<br>What does this prove? Player economies are set up in a way that not everything will be dependent on the most typical item that everyone will want, especially at one time. However, this line of thinking changes when we stop focusing on a small player group, and look at a larger player group.
<br>
<br>Lets say a particular monster drops two weapons: a Longsword of Swift Justice, and a Dagger of Maiming. The items that drops from this weapon do not both drop at the same time, and in all factuallity, the Longsword of Swift Justice is a fairly rare item that drops. Say, his chances of dropping the item are 1 in 100. However, the Dagger of Maiming drops 74 of those 99 times that Longsword does not drop, and there are 25 kills in which nothing drops at all. To top it off, the chances of the weapon dropping reset each time the monster respawns. This is where we enter a state of over-supply and demand.
<br>It seems that the Longsword of Swift Justice is all the rage, and that many people want one. So, people start killing the monsters that are supposed to drop them. In the begininng, the Longsword of Swift Justice already will cost a large ammount. Lets say 500 gold. The Dagger of Maiming, which isn't that bad a weapon itself, opens the market price around 300 gold. Now, it may not be on the same level as the sword, but a lot of people are buying the dagger. As a result that the dagger is wanted and fairly easy to obtain, the dagger's price will actually go UP. However, as time goes on, more and more daggers are entering the equation. Eventually, the market for the dagger goes down. So, we start seeing the price of the dagger dropping to as low as 50 gold.
<br>But, what about the Sword? Well, lets say that there are 6000 people playing on one server, and that 3000 of them are wanting the Longsword of Maiming. However, at the current rate that they appear in the economy, they are quite rare. So, while the dagger is lowering in price, the sword itself is raising in price, not solely because people are wanting to make a profit, but because the rate of the sword entering the economy is so stagnant, that the player demand forces the price up. It's reasons like this that make a player economy hard, but viable (and this example holds true to many real-world applications, but not for the length of period in a game).
<br>However, the key to all of it, is that while some items are more desired than others, not all of them are going to be predominate than the others. There are exceptions to this.
<br>What is an exception? Well, lets take an example from Everquest. The majority of all higher-end items are generally no-drop. What does this do to the high-end items that are not no-drop? Their price increases in range because their are a desired commodity in he community that are viable sources of equipment.
<br>
<br>Now, this system is not without it's flaws. In fact, my arguement is not as strong as the ones from American_Might or the rest. The idea of having a limitless economy is hard to work around, but the idea is to curb it from going out of hand. However, this is a system that has proven to work, as strange as it might sound.
<br>In any place, you will have those people who hoard cash and items. And while that might seem like a viable option to compensate for the imbalance, that compensation is an imbalance in itself. Not because it balances everything, but because it is limiting what people can do. And it makes it easier for someone to corner a market.
<br>
<br>If you find anything in my post that doesn't make sense to you, just ask and I will try to clarify it.

								Wow, ton of great posts, guys. I'm impressed with the understanding of economics most of you have shown. One major thing I believe you are all overlooking is the danger of controlled cash and item flows within a game. Let's take a look at the successes and failures of games like DAoC that have fairly dynamic currency systems combined with restriction of currency generation. First, setting any specific amount of gold for one NPC is a good way to guarantee that NPC, and likely the village/outpost/town he is located in will become obsolete as times passes. The sheer amount of gold the average merchant in a city like Camelot in DAoC dishes out in terms of loot bought from characters each day is staggering. Likewise, the only merchants who receive siginificant amounts of gold daily are those who sell specific supplies, especially crafting supplies. The basis of the fairly successful DAoC carfting economy is the fact that crafting is a staggering expense. To increase my characters crafting level to it's highest possible status, I relied not only on my own quests for coin, but also on the collective work of my entire guild, many of whom had higher level characters and spent quite a large amount of time either adventuring for gold to give me or plying their own crafts to generate funds for the guild. What matters is not the total amount of gold within a server, but rather the amount of money burned by players creating and using items. To successfully create an economy that won't become flooded by currency, all that is required is creation of somewhat necessary sources of money burn. Horse and griffon rides, rent, reagents and ingredients in recipes, etc... money burn off associated with any given item being tied to the generation of that item and the item's power level. Creating a mighty sword might require considerable investment by a smith. The smith invests 500 &quot;gold&quot; as well as several hours of his time questing for ultra rare ingredients. When he completes the sword he sells it for 700 &quot;gold&quot; to a warrior who has generated money by both crafting lesser items and adventuring. Only the gold wich was gained specifically by the warrior from adventuring has been added to the economy. At the same time the 500 gold worth of ingredients has been burned off by giving it to an NPC vendor. 
<br>    The problem with comparing games like Diablo with an MMORPG is that Diablo IS NOT an MMORPG. It's a multiplayer online game, yes, however the lack of a constant world in which the players interact change the nature of the economy dramatically. At any given time in Diablo there could be 25,000+ people doing Pindleskin runs to generate gobs of ultra high level items. A similar creature in WoW will only be campable by a small group, probably no more than the amount of people in one adventuring group. This limits the influx of gold from that creature into each server. Because players are unable to then leave that server and take their items/currency to another server, farming a specific creature becomes vastly less viable as a source of currency/item generation. In that sense Diablo and Diablo II are so unlike an MMORPG that their economies cannot be used as a viable economic model when being compared to MMORPG economies.
<br>   By severely restricting influx of currency/items into a server, Blizzard can avoid almost all of your proposed concerns without any of the vaunted formulae you've used. An economy in which only adventurers partake and in which the number of different goods being sold is miniscule by comparison to a real world economy is almost laughably simplistic. The only concern for Blizzard is to create viable sources of money burn off, as mentioned above, so that the amount of gold in the player economy doesn't become ridiculous.
<br>   As for sources of money burn other than NPC bought gear, potions, etc..consider player vanity as well as advanced item decay. The beauty of games like DAoC is that, although my gear is probably the best I can get for my character as his level, it is also player made and player spellcrafted. It also decays. So every month or so I am commissioning and replacing one or two parts of my gear. I'm able to maintain the level of use because there are a number of powerful spellcrafters on my server who can easily enchant the exact same thing I had before. The difference, of course, is that I am always using a portion of my money to buy new equipment. Say I pay 500 &quot;gold&quot; for an armband. After several months that armband decays from constant repair and abuse (damn trolls drooling on my armor again...). I pay another 500 gold to get the same gear back. So I go to my friend the crafter and his partner the spellcrafter. I give them the gold and they make my armband. The crafter pays 150 gold in materials, or spends gold on adventuring to get the materials, and receives 200 of the 500 gold. Next, the spellcrafter spends 250 gold on materials, and receives 300 of the 500 gold. So now both the crafter and spell crafter are 50 gold richer. I am 500 gold poorer. The net loss of 400 gold within the PLAYER economy has gone to materials, or the cost of griffin rides, healing potions, and repair of gear incurred by the crafters in their quests to gain materials in order to craft for me.
<br>  So simply by adventuring for loot I cause a certain amount of gold to be burned off of the economy, because the cost of adventuring includes not only NPC direct costs such as griffin rides, any kind of ressurection sickness type healing, and basic repairs if i can't do that myself, but also NPC indirect costs because the people who I need to craft my gear have to burn their own gold to craft/adventure. In the long run the cost of item decay burns off a massive amount of gold. There is no need to keep a specific amount of gold with NPCs because they are not, in truth, part of the economy, and to add to it, if they run out of gold, and their surrounding merchants run out of gold, their locales become obsolete and less player populated. This creates a whole slew of problems for players and Blizzard alike.
<br>  Now for item limits. As it has been pointed out, item limits would encourage hoarding and monopolistic prices. Imagine, not only will people be selling Gold on ebay, but basic reagents for healing potions. If a single powerful guild decides to do so, its members could easily concentrate on cornering the market of one reagent from nearly every recipe in the game. Imagine, several years into the game, your character no longer being playable because the prestigous guild on your server has nearly wiped out the availability of a large number of important ingredients and will only sell them to certain people or for outrageous prices. In this item caps become very dangerous. At the same time limiting player inventories or the amount of a specific item a player can have will lead not only to lag caused by constant logging of mules and mains, but also to an economy in which player run stores and consignment merchants become difficult to produce. Limiting palyer inventory in games like Diablo, where infinite instancing means sickening masses of items per player, is perfectly logical. In smaller worlds where instancing is rare, such as an MMORPG server, it just creates muling and other such annoyances and leads to less flavor for people who want to role play a merchant. 
<br>  Well, it looks like my post has gotten ridiculously long. I'll post more later, let me know what you all think.

								A lot has happenend on this thread since last I posted so I am going to backtrack to rewards recieved for quests.  This idea has somewhat relates to my last post as well as the idea of life quests.  Suppose there are some quests that take a bit of extra effort and time to complete.  The rewards for these quests will be greater than the usual quests.  Suppose the reward for the quests is an item that cannot be transfered; I don't exactly like nontranferable items as I feel they take away from the roleplay value of the game but they do help with economic balancing.  The reward could possibly also be permanent to stat increase, skill up, or maybe a new ability.  rewards such as these have no economic value but are better than the usual cash or item.  This is just and idea that only includes a small percentage of quests and doesn't solve the economic problems of much more common quests.  Now moving to more recent topics on this thread
<br>
<br>The recent posts on this thread seem to be ingnorant of what I believe to be the most important part of a successful economy.  Having a set number of coin and or items prevents them from losing value.  In EverQuest they introduced a feature in a zone called &quot;The Bazaar&quot; that allowed all players in that zone to sell items at what ever prices they chose as well as view what items other people where selling and the price they were asking.  This makes it easy to find the item you are looking for as well as compare prices.  This allowed players who were selling items to set their price lower than all other players who were selling the same item.  This doesn't affect rare items too as they were usually priced much higher than most people could afford.  I once bought a Shard of Night for my Shadow Knight for 7000 platnium pieces a few months later I could buy the same dagger for 3500 platnium peices.  This is an amizing rate of economic deflation which is contrary to our goal.  
<br>
<br>When the idea of item decay was first proposed I thought it was a good idea to create yet another way to make people spend their money.  After thinking about it for awhile I realized how tedious that it would be and way Blizzard Entertainment opts not to have it.  Item decay does a great job on keeping the economy stable in a controlled character only economy.  As the average level of controlled characters becomes higher the controlled character economy becomes more and more likely to becoming victim of being raped by significant inflations or deflations.  With DragonSword's Equation System and the idea of treasury the economy is controlled equally by all characters controlled and uncontrolled.  As cash continues to flow through all of the different DragonSword Equation System the ammount of cash will deviate somewhat from the numeric targets.  When this deviation is noticed a few changes can be made to how money transfers between the different values to get them back on target.  With DragonSword's Equation System, the treasury, and the constant additions of new ideas from erudite minds we can become ever closer to a stable economy.
<br>
<br>Epifany:
<br>
<br>All characters controlled and uncontrolled have equal importance within a stable economy.
