								I just can't agree with the whole concept of rituals for warrior, and their being non magical in nature. As I understand it from their presentation, they have a mystical outlook on things. Rituals in real life legend always have as well.
<br>
<br>Consider that we are in a high fantasy setting, such none magic rituals would also most certainly detract from the air and flavor of the setting.
<br>
<br>Secondarily, rituals in that respect should be full caster oriented. Definitely mage, possibly Warlock, and possibly Priest.
<br>
<br>Now why do I say possibly Warlock? It's my understanding that Warlocks don't get their magic in the same way that a regular wizard does. My understanding of it, is that they are the traditional &quot;witch&quot; but opted not using the term witch so as not to offend wiccans. This being the case, a traditional witch or Warlock in this case gets their powers from an extra planar entity, generally of a more nefarious power. The Burning Legion as it applies here.
<br>
<br>So their magic is almost more of a &quot;power&quot; given to them so to speak. It's not given so much through study as it is a boon from an entity. Perhaps they may study to better understand to some point, and that could be the only justification that I see to them having access to rituals, and certainly not to the degree of a mage givern their class make up and nature.
<br>
<br>Priests I can see, as priests in our own world already have rituals that they perform. Excorcism's are a classic ritual of a sort that are performmed per example. While some may not believe in this sort of thing, the actual ritual does exist in the catholic church today, along with many others. Thats just an example. With that being said, imagine what sort of rites might exist in a world full of high fantasy?
<br>
<br>
<br>As to the bard, I also wondered why there was no bard. I can understand why the Warcraft games would have no bard, but we aren't in warcraft anymore, we are in the WORLD of Warcraft, which is much diverse then a simple wargame. In essence pandora's box has just been opened, and now there is so much more before us then what there was prior.
<br>
<br>So will there be a bard?
<br>
<br>
<br>Titles. I'd love to know whats being done regarding titles. I really hate the thought of someone leveling up, and getting a heritary title of nobility just for reaching level x, y, or z. Titles should come from actions, thought, and deeds.
<br>
<br>In EQ early on pre kunark, I earned the title of Lord from my peers. Many had a tendancy to refer to me as &quot;Lord Banegrivm&quot; for my actions as a paladin. It wasn't something that I ever asked for, it was just something that happened through my actions. How I dealt with situations and the way I treated people.
<br>
<br>Why should someone that levels up and has no meaning or understanding of the title that would not even live up to it be rewarded in such a fashion? Quite honestly I believe that such rewards should come through action and handed out by GM's.
<br>
<br>I think that would be the most equitable and fair way of resolving the issue. Let the GM's watch to see who acts appropriately, and when the events happen, let those whom are involved be rewarded their just do based upon their actions.
<br>
<br>Nobility doesn't come from birth, it doesn't come from how fast you can level, or how much loot you have, it comes from how you act, react, and carry yourself as an individual.

As I understand it from their presentation, they have a mystical outlook on things. Rituals in real life legend always have as well. 
<br>
<br>Consider that we are in a high fantasy setting, such none magic rituals would also most certainly detract from the air and flavor of the setting. <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>Something can be highly &quot;Mystical&quot; in nature without being magical, IMHO, but perhaps this is just a debate of definitions. =)
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>Secondarily, rituals in that respect should be full caster oriented. Definitely mage, possibly Warlock, and possibly Priest. 
<br>
<br>Now why do I say possibly Warlock? It's my understanding that Warlocks don't get their magic in the same way that a regular wizard does. My understanding of it, is that they are the traditional &quot;witch&quot; but opted not using the term witch so as not to offend wiccans. This being the case, a traditional witch or Warlock in this case gets their powers from an extra planar entity, generally of a more nefarious power. The Burning Legion as it applies here. <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>What's your justification for only allowing pure caster classes to have rituals? In a role-playing sense, Druids and Shamans would most certainly be among the most likely types of characters to participate or lead some sort of ritual, IMHO, and Paladins also can be highly ritualistic. 
<br>
<br>The term Shaman is so generic (and, IMHO, overused) that it's easy to agrue about, but I would say that at least in several cases, people who are considered to be &quot;Shamans&quot; are often involved in ritualistic activities. Unfortuantely, the term itself is very vague (i.e. is a Native American &quot;Medicine Man/Woman&quot; a &quot;Shaman&quot;?), and it's being phased out in many cases. 
<br>
<br>Charlemagne, often considered a &quot;historical&quot; example of a Paladin, was highly religious and relied heavily on relics of the church for power in his rule. The knighting ceremony, as well as his coronation as a king, are highly ritualistic activities, and he is likely to have participated in or lead many other church-related rituals as well.

<br>
<br>Every Wiccan I know probably would *not* want to see someone who equates to a witch refered to as a Warlock, since in my experience, &quot;Warlock&quot; carries a negative connotation in most Wiccan circles. It apparently is considered to mean something along the lines of &quot;truth twister&quot; and it's considered derogitory; much to the contrary of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. =) 
<br>
<br>Hmm, I could be reading you wrong there; just realized you're probably talking about them matching stereotypical movie generalization of a witch, not an actual &quot;wiccan&quot; or the like. That's what I get for reading things when I'm tired. =) From that angle, I might agree, but I still think Warlock isn't a very suitable name if they're doing it specifically to appease wiccans. Still, extraplanar source of power or not, I'd see things like demon summoning as being perfect examples of a &quot;ritual&quot; activity. 
<br>
<br>As a side note, however, if you read the background in the Warcraft RPG book, you'll note that the spells used by Mages are directly tied to demons as well. All Arcane magic in Warcraft apparently at very least attracts their attention, but it's also apparently corrupting and addicting. So, Mages are potentially just as strongly tied to darker forces, just on a less obvious scale.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>As to the bard, I also wondered why there was no bard. I can understand why the Warcraft games would have no bard, but we aren't in warcraft anymore, we are in the WORLD of Warcraft, which is much diverse then a simple wargame. In essence pandora's box has just been opened, and now there is so much more before us then what there was prior. 
<br>
<br>So will there be a bard? <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>Even if there's no class, someone could certainly role-play one. I intend to bring my D&amp;D bard into WoW as one of my more minor characters.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>Titles. I'd love to know whats being done regarding titles. I really hate the thought of someone leveling up, and getting a heritary title of nobility just for reaching level x, y, or z. Titles should come from actions, thought, and deeds. 
<br>
<br>In EQ early on pre kunark, I earned the title of Lord from my peers. Many had a tendancy to refer to me as &quot;Lord Banegrivm&quot; for my actions as a paladin. It wasn't something that I ever asked for, it was just something that happened through my actions. How I dealt with situations and the way I treated people. 
<br>
<br>Why should someone that levels up and has no meaning or understanding of the title that would not even live up to it be rewarded in such a fashion? Quite honestly I believe that such rewards should come through action and handed out by GM's. 
<br>
<br>I think that would be the most equitable and fair way of resolving the issue. Let the GM's watch to see who acts appropriately, and when the events happen, let those whom are involved be rewarded their just do based upon their actions. 
<br>
<br>Nobility doesn't come from birth, it doesn't come from how fast you can level, or how much loot you have, it comes from how you act, react, and carry yourself as an individual. <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>Agree with you 100% on this part. =)

<br> - Yes, I agree with you on the relics and what not, but I just still can't really see him performing rituals. Sure he was knighted, but keep in mind he was the person the ritual was done upon, not the practicioner of the rite itself. Granted I will give that according to the chivalric code, anu knight can knight another, but when you look at rituals in a mystical sense, I just can't see that as justification for allowing them to cast ritual magic.

<br>
<br> - There are actually two seperate definition of the word Witch. There is the original version, and the later. The original was the term as we all know that was used through movies. The secondary, is the term that was adopted by Wiccans. The prior isn't one that I often discuss much, especially publicly. Particularily because of the delicate details of it. If you haven't yet, you might want to read or look over a copy of the Malleus Maleficarum. Translated from latin to english, it reads &quot;The Witch's Hammer&quot;. It was the guide wrote in the 1400's by two christian men, that was later used by the inquisitors of medieval europe. 
<br>
<br> - Very spooky and eerie stuff. Warlock by the way is also the title of a male witch, according to the original definition. I've studied real world lore and legend in depth, hence how I ran across some of this stuff to begin with.

<br>
<br> - I don't think magic is demonic in nature, I think it's more or less a point of neutrality, but something that does attract demons. Keep in mind there have been plenty of good mages. The Kiron Tor and the Guardians of Tirisfal come to mind. Warlocks however don't study magic the way a mage does. A mage actually learns how to use magic and bend it to his will. A warlock however recieves their power through an unholy pact from a demon.

<br>
<br> - Yep, I totally agree with you. One of my guildmates has a big thing for bards, and she was dissapointed that Warcraft had no bards. I suggested that she play a warrior or rogue and RP it, as I felt either would be the best logical choice dependant upon how she saw her character.
<br>
<br>As to the titles again, I would love to get a response from Kat on this, or from someone. We've yet to hear much regarding titles. 
<br>
<br>One thing I will say, is I have all sorts of renewed hope regarding this game now that we at least know that the devs are all for RP.
<br>
<br>I especially loved GF's post regarding &quot;mobs&quot; and &quot;Creeps&quot;. Thats one thing that I've always hated about other MMOG's, the way they dumb down the atmosphere with mechanical jargon.

								I have played EQ, DAOC, and SWG, and I am losing (or have lost) interest in all three.
<br>
<br>Back in EQ, I remember my first character, a dark elf cleric.  My best friend was a shadow knight and we levelled up in the Nektulos Forest and Lavastorm Mountains zones until the mid teens.  I remember the first time we found the bridge across the river in the forest..  It was a foggy night - you couldn't see across..  For the first time in a game, I was afraid.  I remember logging in one day and getting a tell from my SK friend who was hiding from some monks in Freeport.  I was jealous, because it seemed like such an exciting adventure.  Those were the days.
<br>
<br>Once I left the forest, the game lost the element of danger.  Once I figured out that I wasn't going to be attacked by humans at every turn, the thrill of sneaking around was gone.  Then came the uber guilds.  Then it was more like Treasure Quest.  Then I only played to visit my friends.
<br>
<br>When I started playing DAOC, it was a definite improvement from EQ at the time.  Melee combat was more involved than auto-attacking.  Items degraded and had to be repaired, and replaced as you outgrew them.  I liked the way things were done - especially the horses and bindstones.  In EQ I hated being reliant on other characters to function normally, and I hated having to run everywhere.  Well, the part about being reliant on other players eventually reared its ugly head in DAOC too, with the advent of Spellcrafting.  Farming for cash became common as money was needed for trade skills.  Drops were no longer the best items.  All there was to do was level and grind away at trades.  Boring.
<br>
<br>I did thoroughly enjoy the Battleground areas with my assassin.  It was the most excitement and enjoyment I ever had in DAOC.  But once I passed the Realm Point and level caps, that was the end of it.  The expansions have elite items now, but I don't feel like grinding through the level treadmill just to acquire artifacts, and then have to level them too.  Boring.
<br>
<br>There is the potential for PvP too, but since everybody and their brother has a bot account, I wouldn't be able to compete even if I had the best gear.  Game over.
<br>
<br>Then there was SWG - a short lived experiment for me.  When I first started, I had a vision of being an intergalactic arms dealer.  I was Terrance Lawless, CEO of Lawless Weaponry.  At first I wanted to own a ship I could use for smuggling, but ships weren't in game (and I don't know if they ever will be), so I settled for weaponcrafting.  In effect, I also had to master the surveying trade, as that was the most efficient way to find materials to work with.  Before long I was teamed up with a businessman and an architect, and several others.  We raised money by doing repetitive &quot;search and destroy&quot; type quests, so I had to work on my combat skills.  And then, resources started jumping from planet to planet, disappearing on a whim.  Frequently, materials would move to sites guarded by agressive NPCs.  Sometimes the NPCs would migrate to sites we were already mining with our machines and we would be unable to service them or extract materials from them.  Disappointed and frustrated with having to continually scale back or redefine my goals and plans, I closed my account.  The only good thing I can say for the game is that the looks of the characters are customizable to an insane level of variety.
<br>
<br>Given Blizzard's track record, I'm certain I'll be quite happy with WoW, and I am eagerly awaiting its release.  I really want to get into the beta, but I'm not getting my hopes up.  Anyway, I do want to bring up a few key points in closing.
<br>
<br>Players like to be self sufficient.  I shouldn't need a buffbot and full MP SC Alch gear or uber drops just to stand a chance.  If I'm a crafter, I shouldn't need to train skills that don't apply to my trade just to get my materials.  I don't have a problem with metalworkers doing some mining, but I shouldn't have to hire a contingent of guards and build a freaking extractor just to forge a sword.
<br>
<br>From what I've seen, the variety of quest types will be enough to provide challenges to gamers with all kinds of play styles.  Simply traveling from one area to another is not an adventure.  It is part of the game many of us would skip if it were possible - this brings me to the transportation issue.  We all know about the griffons, so Bliz seems to have that covered.  On the other hand, being in a dangerous area can be exciting.  If all of the encounters are just routine fights...  I would have a mixed reaction.  I like to have a plan for an encounter, follow the plan, and be rewarded with a flawless victory in that encounter.  However, I don't want it to happen the same way every time.  That ends up being boring repetition.  No danger, no risk, no excitement, no fun.  But I'm sure Bliz already has that figured out - that's why D2X 1.10 is so hard. :)
<br>
<br>Thinking about hiring guards makes me wonder if there will be mercenary camps like in Warcraft 3...  I do like the idea of hiring some goons to watch my back while I'm digging for shiny rocks...
<br>
<br>Anyway..  I better go before I overstay my welcome...
<br>
<br>Cheers

								Well I can't say I agree with you on degrading equipment. I think thats one of the worst things that I have seen in an MMORPG. As RPG's are about story, having such a focus on equipment as DAoC and EQ both have really, just detracts from the story element.
<br>
<br>I do agree with you about the Battlegrounds in DAoC. That was my favorite moment about the whole game. I enjoyed it so much that when I finally got to RvR, I was greatly dissapointed. It went from being an organized assault to a mindless zerg rush. Very very very dissapointing.
<br>
<br>I loved the Battlegrounds so much that I was tempted to go back to DAoC just to fight in the battlegrounds. There was just so much possibility for that game, it's just a shame they chose to compete with EQ instead of doing their own thing as they originaly set out to do. I think the Battlegrounds are a good example of Mythic's potential for &quot;doing their own thing&quot;. Pity the rest of the game wasn't.

								<blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>I have played EQ, DAOC, and SWG, and I am losing (or have lost) interest in all three. 
<br>
<br>Back in EQ, I remember my first character, a dark elf cleric. My best friend was a shadow knight and we levelled up in the Nektulos Forest and Lavastorm Mountains zones until the mid teens. I remember the first time we found the bridge across the river in the forest.. It was a foggy night - you couldn't see across.. For the first time in a game, I was afraid. I remember logging in one day and getting a tell from my SK friend who was hiding from some monks in Freeport. I was jealous, because it seemed like such an exciting adventure. Those were the days. 
<br>
<br>Once I left the forest, the game lost the element of danger. Once I figured out that I wasn't going to be attacked by humans at every turn, the thrill of sneaking around was gone. Then came the uber guilds. Then it was more like Treasure Quest. Then I only played to visit my friends. 
<br>
<br>When I started playing DAOC, it was a definite improvement from EQ at the time. Melee combat was more involved than auto-attacking. Items degraded and had to be repaired, and replaced as you outgrew them. I liked the way things were done - especially the horses and bindstones. In EQ I hated being reliant on other characters to function normally, and I hated having to run everywhere. Well, the part about being reliant on other players eventually reared its ugly head in DAOC too, with the advent of Spellcrafting. Farming for cash became common as money was needed for trade skills. Drops were no longer the best items. All there was to do was level and grind away at trades. Boring. 
<br>
<br>I did thoroughly enjoy the Battleground areas with my assassin. It was the most excitement and enjoyment I ever had in DAOC. But once I passed the Realm Point and level caps, that was the end of it. The expansions have elite items now, but I don't feel like grinding through the level treadmill just to acquire artifacts, and then have to level them too. Boring. 
<br>
<br>There is the potential for PvP too, but since everybody and their brother has a bot account, I wouldn't be able to compete even if I had the best gear. Game over. 
<br>
<br>Then there was SWG - a short lived experiment for me. When I first started, I had a vision of being an intergalactic arms dealer. I was Terrance Lawless, CEO of Lawless Weaponry. At first I wanted to own a ship I could use for smuggling, but ships weren't in game (and I don't know if they ever will be), so I settled for weaponcrafting. In effect, I also had to master the surveying trade, as that was the most efficient way to find materials to work with. Before long I was teamed up with a businessman and an architect, and several others. We raised money by doing repetitive &quot;search and destroy&quot; type quests, so I had to work on my combat skills. And then, resources started jumping from planet to planet, disappearing on a whim. Frequently, materials would move to sites guarded by agressive NPCs. Sometimes the NPCs would migrate to sites we were already mining with our machines and we would be unable to service them or extract materials from them. Disappointed and frustrated with having to continually scale back or redefine my goals and plans, I closed my account. The only good thing I can say for the game is that the looks of the characters are customizable to an insane level of variety. 
<br>
<br>Given Blizzard's track record, I'm certain I'll be quite happy with WoW, and I am eagerly awaiting its release. I really want to get into the beta, but I'm not getting my hopes up. Anyway, I do want to bring up a few key points in closing. 
<br>
<br>Players like to be self sufficient. I shouldn't need a buffbot and full MP SC Alch gear or uber drops just to stand a chance. If I'm a crafter, I shouldn't need to train skills that don't apply to my trade just to get my materials. I don't have a problem with metalworkers doing some mining, but I shouldn't have to hire a contingent of guards and build a freaking extractor just to forge a sword.

<br>
<br>Kithcore Woods and certain monsters in EQ -- spectres, giants, etc -- scare me to this day. =) My wizard could two-shot a spectre with Ice Comet and I still avoided 'em; there simply was a strong atmosphere to certain areas of EQ that I feel other games have always lacked. Diablo I had that, too, IMHO. The Butcher and certain other areas always worried me. =)
<br>
<br>I loved the melee system in DAoC, best one I've seen to date. Everquest was just too much like...whack a mole? I don't know. =) It was just repetitive, and you had no control over the outcome of melee combat in many cases.
<br>
<br>Merc camps are a great idea.

<br>
<br>There were no Battlegrounds when I played DAoC at release, so I can't really comment on 'em, but I always found RvR very dull. I made it to Realm Rank 4 only because I found it to be something of a requirement to compete in PvE once they implemented Realm Abilities in the game. I liked the concept of RAs, but they weren't very balanced or the like. I enjoyed Epic PvE in DAoC very much, but it required a *lot* more people than in EQ in some cases because of a specific code that requires [x] number of attackers to successfully hit certain mobs.
<br>
<br>DAoC had a lot of potential, and I still think it does. Frontiers sounds pretty good, and I love the Artifact system in ToA. I'm just too burned out now after working for them for so long as a Team Lead.

<br>All of my frontier action was zerg and counter zerg, keep battles were a boring 2 minutes compared to the sometimes multi-hour seiges in Caledonia.
<br>
<br>I double-capped both my characters from Caledonia, and I was also very tempted to just make another character to play in there more, but I wanted to get to 50 too much(never made it of course..) :/
<br>
<br>Also, it was weird, people in Cale said that the people were so disorganized compared to Frontiers.. but at least it was fun.

<br>All of my frontier action was zerg and counter zerg, keep battles were a boring 2 minutes compared to the sometimes multi-hour seiges in Caledonia. 
<br>
<br>I double-capped both my characters from Caledonia, and I was also very tempted to just make another character to play in there more, but I wanted to get to 50 too much(never made it of course..) :/ 
<br>
<br>Also, it was weird, people in Cale said that the people were so disorganized compared to Frontiers.. but at least it was fun. 
<br>
<br>Edit: Blah, tired sorry for mistakes.<hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>I found frontier RvR to be the least organized part of the game. We were fortunate that Kiamar and such were around *sometimes* to pull things together, but even with excellent leadership, I found the battles to be incredbly chaotic.

<br>
<br>I enjoyed Epic Raids in DAoC very much, but more in a leadership role than as a participant. Why? Because of the level of difficulty for controlling such a large group, and because of the strategy involved in some of the encounters. Caer Sidi was designed to take 9-10 hours to clear; using a specific tactic, my raids were able to clear it in about 3-4 hours, and I believe Kiamar can do it in even less now using the same tactic and players that are more familiar with it. I've had some raid fights that felt pretty epic -- our first tangle with Apocalypse lasted almost an hour, since we needed to figure out what types of spells and abilities were effective at dealing him damage. I also like long duration raids; it's just a difference in preference, I suppose. Some areas -- such as Caer Sidi -- just felt very much like an old school dungeon crawl to me, and that's probably why I enjoyed 'em so much.
<br>
<br>I wish I was around at Bloody Kithcor, I've heard a lot of good things about the war there. =)

								I'm all for raids in the sense of a raid by definition. I.E. you go in, raiding a hobgoblin keep, going in to infiltrate and clear out a warrens full of goblins, etc. The whole &quot;lets go kill uber mobs thing&quot; is just insanely boring. What were they thinking when they came up with that? The whole uber concept is so boring, even Christopher Reeve would get up and walk away.
<br>
<br>Bloody Kithicor was the best RP event that I ever witnessed ever in any MMORPG that I have played. That says alot considering I played the originals like NWN from AOL.
<br>
<br>Bloody Kithicor was a series of events that lead up to a final grand battle in Kithicor woods, that ended with the driving out of the Teir'Dal armies, and the tainting of that woods by the god of hate, leaving it a haunted copse, where spirits of the damned would roam in the darkness of night.
<br>
<br>I'll never forget being in North Freeport when my character ended up becoming pulled into the war, and was selected to lead the armies of light, against the Teir'Dal armies. All the events were spectacularly woven together. I still remember having people go out to guard a caravan of envoy's from freeport, and having scouting missions on Neriak when the dark elven armies began to marshal.
<br>
<br>What I think was the best thing about the war, was that it wasn't really restricted to level. EVERYONE fought in Bloody Kithicor. One of the chief scouts for our army was a ninth level ranger who scouted through Nektulous Forest as the armies began their march.
<br>
<br>I still remember sitting in High Pass at the gates of High Keep, with two groups of people dragging generals to their deaths. We were even pinned down at one point in time, forced back into the keep itself, and had to call for reinforcements. It was truly fantastic.
<br>
<br>It felt like the actual outbreak of war. I can also remember when the dark elves tried to make their push into Rivervale, and we sent in one of the big uberguilds as a countermeasure to push them back into the forest. We eventually pincered them in the forest and finished them off.

								Not only does that event itself sound impressive, but the aftermath was also significant. Kithcor became an undead-infested mid level zone, where from what I hear, it had once been a newbie zone. I wasn't around that far back in EQ, but from the time I started, I was warned against traveling in Kithcor at night. The event really did change the world; and that's something that has been sadly absent in most recent games.

<br>
<br>Chaos does not necessarily equate to corruption, however, and it's difficult to say if magic in World of Warcraft is inherently demonic in nature or not.

<br>
<br>I don't believe there have been any official announcements about how possible it would be to raid a town in WoW, but I certainly would hope that we'll see that kind of player vs. player conflict in the game. A massive war would certainly be very entertaining and challenging.

Kithcor became an undead-infested mid level zone, where from what I hear, it had once been a newbie zone.

The event really did change the world; and that's something that has been sadly absent in most recent games.<hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br> - Thats exactly what an MMORPG should be about. That event made the game feel like a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, which put the RP in the MMORPG. It's a pity that SOE put a stop to it all. These games were never meant to be the raid based loot fests that they have evolved into. It's a damn shame looking back at what once was and what is now.

<br>
<br> - I did read the manual, and I also read the Warcraft RPG as well. I can't say I agree that magic is the embodiement of chaos or necessarily evil. If it were so evil, there clearly would not have been so many good aligned individuals wielding its power. Lets face it, sure there have been evils wielding it, but there have been TONS of good individuals also wielding the power.

I think the current state of the game more then proves that point with flying colors. I thought Kaplan's remark about devs playing god was more on the money then perhaps most ever realized.
<br>
<br>What those guilds had nothing to do with role playing. If anything, to me thats a symbol of everything thats wrong in role playing games. EQ was never intended to be &quot;uber&quot; by any means. EQ was intended to be a game that was a questing game, thats why its called &quot;EverQuest&quot;.
<br>
<br>You can thank the uber guilds of EQ for planting that seed in Sony which ultimately spread into the sham of an RPG that it is now.
<br>
<br>For example, Lady Vox was originally a quest NPC, not a &quot;mob&quot; meant to be slaughtered. Pre Kunark she was the toughest NPC in the game. She used to be a quest giver if you hailed her in elder dragon and had faction with her. Fires of Heaven, not paying attention to the role play part, just set out to slaughter Vox mindlessly.
<br>
<br>Brad McQuaid knowing that Vox had no loot on her as she was a quest NPC, went with Fires of Heaven on their raid. As Vox had no loot, Brad was forced to reward FoH manually through the GM client, and later stocked Vox with droppable loot, and the quest surrounding here was removed.
<br>
<br>Most old world quests in EQ were never solved. It's a combination of faction, paying attention to the structure, items in zones, drops, what the drops identify as, and the symbols that can be found. These things are all hints and clues to the story which lead to MANY quests. Sixty percent of all old world quests have never even been done once for the first time by the way.
<br>
<br>Kerafyrm is the tie into EQ2, as Kerafyrm is slain by a paladin of Mithaniel Marr who collects three artifacts of three fallen gods from the first war of the gods detailed in the manual. The sword of Mithaniel Marr known as Truthbringer, the dragon pendant of Rallos Zek, and the book of Solusek Ro. All of which are apart of the Prophecy of Trakanon where the fourth hero ascends to save the world from destruction at the hands of Kerafyrm.
<br>
<br>You can read more about it on the link in my sig, in the EQ Codex of War. Most of what you'll find there was also the foundation for the EQ RPG when I went to work for White Wolf to collaborate with the Wieck brothers and other authors on the project.
<br>
<br>If these guilds had really been following the storyline, they would have truly followed the storyline and certainly role played that. Blindly killing &quot;mobs&quot; is not role playing or following a storyline. 
<br>
<br>As to Brenlo, he has no love of role players or role playing, that much I can tell you from personal interaction with the man combined with what I know about SOE internally on a professional level.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Banegrivm ]<br></font></small>

								Interesting. Do you know what the old quest associated with Vox was, by any chance? And on a random note, any clue what the old version of the Fiery Avenger quest was in Beta, before they put in the Plane of Sky version? I spent a long time searching for the FA before the recent version was put in, I've always wondered if it was ever properly implemented as some people claimed.
<br>
<br>Hopefully Blizzard will put in some quests that are as interesting and mysterious as some of the old unsolved ones in EQ.
