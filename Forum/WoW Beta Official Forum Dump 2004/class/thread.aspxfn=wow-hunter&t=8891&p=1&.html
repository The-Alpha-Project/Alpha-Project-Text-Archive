								The fundamental problems with the hunter (from what I have seen) are the low DPS, severe PvP weakness, ridiculously low pet damage, the inability to track, the inability to use stealth while stalking prey.  I’ve attempted to address some of these concerns (as I have read).  Blizzard could correct the DPS problem by simply creating arrows with elemental effects on them but this would still do nothing for the hunters ranged uniqueness as anyone could use arrows.  Additionally, the pet needs to be more of a fundamental threat to anyone who chooses to attack a hunter (PvP).  That is why I suggested a grapple attack for the pet, making is so no damage is dealt but the opponent is put in great danger by being immobilized.  As a primarily ranged fighter, it shouldn’t be unreasonable for the hunter to be able to improve the range of his attacks (possibly through talents).  Most hunter spells/abilities I have not changed, but the ones I have either changed or added I have tried to explain as clearly as possible.  Please don’t flame as these are merely suggestions for both Blizzards and our benefit, but I imagine constructive comments are helpful to blizzard…that being said I do like the “sneak peak” talents that blizzard posted earlier.
<br>
<br>
<br>PET ABILITIES 
<br>Call Pet: (unchanged)
<br>Beast Taming: (unchanged)
<br>Dismiss Pet: (unchanged)
<br>Revive Pet: (unchanged)
<br>Mend Pet: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>Equip Pet:  (new) allows you to equip barding (armour), saddle bags, and special weapons to your pet (metal claws, spiked plates, etc.), making them a formidable fighting ally
<br>
<br>Tame mount:  (new) this ability allows the hunter to track and tame a beast that would be suitable as a mount.
<br>
<br>Grapple opponent:  (new) when the hunter is in melee with an opponent he can command his pet to grapple the opponent allowing him to back away or continue to attack.  The grapple lasts X seconds before the opponent breaks free – an ability like this is needed to correct the hunters innate PvP weakness, preventing people from simply ignoring the pet and attacking the hunter  
<br>
<br>
<br>ASPECTS
<br>Aspect of the cobra:  (new) the hunter takes on the aspect of the cobra, increasing his attack rate (melee/ranged) by X%.  This is recommended when the hunter finds himself in an overpowering situation and needs to strike fast and furious.  The effects stack with other rate enhancements (i.e. quivers)
<br>
<br>Aspect of the Cheetah:  (modified) The Hunter takes on the aspects of a cheetah, increasing movement speed.  This can be used to travel or to back away from monsters so you can use your ranged weapon. – currently the stun and extra damage taken make this a useless option in combat…mobs always seem to be able to catch up to me even if I have this active with a healthy lead.
<br>
<br>Aspect of the Pack: (modified) (group aspect) the hunter is able to confer on members of his group the aspect of the pack.  Through the use of commands and precise co-ordination the group then becomes a far more effective killing machine.  All members of the group have their attack damage (range/melee/spell), stamina and spirit increased by X%.  The group essentially becomes one large opponent due to their coordinated attacks.  (again, this improves a hunters usefulness in groups dramatically)
<br>
<br>Aspect of the wolf:  (new) the hunter is able to take on the aspect of the wolf allowing him to stalk prey unseen but reduces his movement speed to 60% of normal.  Attacking or generally provoking an enemy cancels the aspect.  (I don’t think the hunter should be able to confer this ability on group members but if it was, it would make things reeeeeally interesting…imagine a group of 5 stalking prey like a pack of wolves.  Perhaps if it was used in a group setting there would be a chance that it would fail exposing one or more of the members)
<br>
<br>Aspect of the Beast:  (unchanged) 
<br>Aspect of the Monkey: (unchanged) – (should be improved with talents to make mongoose bite useful and make the hunter more valuable in groups when he can confer aspects on other group members – warriors/pally’s/rogues would love us)
<br>
<br>BEAST SPELLS
<br>Scare Beast: (unchanged)
<br>Eagle Eye: (unchanged, but must be fixed as it rarely works…we always get the “no line of sight” message so I personally never use it and it should be useable indoors.  I tried to cast it while standing on a balcony and I got the “does not work indoors” message)
<br>Beast Lore: (unchanged) 
<br>
<br>Beast stalker:  (new) this spell allows the hunter to use his senses and keen insight to track hostile beasts.  When activated, beasts show up on the hunter’s mini map allowing him to plan his attack and stalk his prey.
<br>
<br>Beast meld:  (new) this spell gives the hunter the chance to learn a beast’s special/unique attack (similar to the beast taming ability).  The hunters armour is reduced by 100% for the 20 seconds it takes to learn its ability.  The hunter can only learn one attack at a time and the ability will remain with the hunter for 60 min (with a refresh of 30 seconds).
<br>
<br>
<br>MELEE SPELLS
<br>Dual-Wield (passive): (unchanged)
<br>Raptor Strike: (unchanged but more damage would be nice…the extra damage at the highest levels is fairly small)
<br>Wing Clip: (unchanged)
<br>Mongoose Bite: (unchanged but should have an improved chance by improving aspect of the monkey with talents)
<br>
<br>Ranged Combat
<br>Multi shot:  (modified) Fires multiple missiles all at once hitting a given target with three arrows or bullets. (Improved with talents.  i.e. 4 arrows, 5 arrows…)
<br>
<br>Head shot:  (new) While under the aspect of the wolf (stealth) the hunter is able to take his time in stalking his prey (aim) and make a devastating shot to the head of an opponent killing it instantly.  Head shot has a 10 sec “cast” rate and a 60 min refresh time.  The percentage chance is 15% plus or minus the difference in level’s between the target and the hunter (up to a max of +/- 10%).  For example a level 40 hunter stalking a level 50 opponent would have a 5% chance to kill an opponent (15%-10% = 5%), where as a level 40 hunter stalking a level 33 opponent would have a 22% chance (15% + 7% = 22%).  A failed shot misses the target and generates a large amount of agro.  (There’s risk and reward and it would be a valuable ability to a group looking to fight a horribly powerful boss or if a group member (mage/priest) was in trouble being attacked by a mob)
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – frost: (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with cold dealing an additional X damage and slowing the targets movement by Y% for Z seconds
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – fire:  (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with fire dealing an additional X damage and burning the target for an additional Y damage for Z seconds.
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – disease: (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with a debilitating disease dealing an additional X damage and damaging the target for an additional Y damage for Z seconds.  Additional beasts that come within 2 yards of the afflicted beast catch the disease as well possibly spreading the disease even farther.
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – lightning:  (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with electrical energy dealing an additional X damage.  The lightning will jump to any other nearby beasts (within 5 yards) and deal 50% of the initial damage to them.
<br>
<br>Auto Shot: (unchanged)
<br>Serpent Sting: (unchanged)
<br>Viper Sting: (unchanged)
<br>Arcane Shot: (unchanged)
<br>Scorpid Sting: (unchanged)
<br>Volley: (unchanged)
<br>Hunter's Mark: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>TRAPS
<br>Immolation Trap: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>Frost Trap: (unchanged – even though is has extremely limited usefulness since damage breaks the trap.  I’ve used it once, and that was just to see how it worked.  Personally I think it needs improvement, perhaps it should deal damage or be similar to a mages frost nova and keep an enemy or several enemies in an area immobilized for X seconds)
<br>
<br>Explosive Trap: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>
<br>OTHER
<br>Throw net:  (new) The hunter magically conjures a net of vines and thorns that he then throws at a given target, immobilizing it for X seconds and dealing Y damage from the thorns over the duration of the net.
<br>
<br>Alpha leader (passive):  (new) The hunter takes on the persona of an alpha leader allowing him to lead and guide members of his GROUP through subtle body language and hand signals.  This allows the hunter to cast any of his known aspects on other GROUP members.  If an individual leaves the group they loose the benefit of the aspects.
<br>
<br>Disengage: (unchanged)
<br>Feign Death: (unchanged)
<br>Flare: (unchanged)
<br>Rapid Fire: (unchanged)
<br>Mail: - The ability to wear mail armour should be lowered to at least level 30.  The hunter has to spend a large amount of money on pets, arrows, food, and equipment.  Lowering the mail requirement to 30 would give the hunter the “breathing room” to spend slightly less on his armour (leather) just to throw it out at a certain level when mail is available.
<br>
<br>
<br>TALENTS – Several of the above spells/skills/abilities are very open to improvement from talents.  For example, the three trees could be:
<br>
<br>Pet talents: blood frenzy (increase the pets attack and defense), matriarch (allows the hunter to call multiple pets at a time), Special attacks, undying loyalty (when the hunter is physically attacked by a mob the pet enters a berserk state to protect his master by increasing the frequency of its learned traits/abilities like growl/bite), etc.
<br>
<br>Ranged combat:  Improved fire damage, improved cold damage, improved lightning damage, improved disease damage, Recover projectiles (allows the hunter to recover X% of projectiles imbedded in a corpse he killed), increased ranged attacks, etc.
<br>
<br>Beast talents:  empathize with pet (the hunter experiences a boost in stats/damage/armour/speed – whatever is appropriate for the pet he has) while his pet is active.  This makes the pet more of a companion than simply a meat shield and the pets death will negatively affect the hunter with some sort of decrease to a stat/armour etc., improved stalking, improved aspects, Increase the number of active aspects (this would allow a hunter the ability to have multiple aspects active, and at higher levels when he has alpha leader, confer multiple bonuses on group members), butcher beast (recover a small amount of food from a slain beast for his pet)

								I think all of these ideas would enhance the experience of playing a hunter. 
<br>
<br>However, I have some things to add. 
<br>
<br>The main ability I'd like added to the hunter class is the ability to detect stealth. So he can act more of as a scout to the group. No rogues can sneak up and backstab. 
<br>
<br>I'd like to be able to equip armor on and/or use our pet for storage. 
<br>
<br>I think abilitys such as stun and sprint should be able to be trained on our pet. 
<br>
<br>This way our pets can not only catch up to our enemys but they can stun them to prevent them from running away so easily. 
<br>
<br>I'd like to see the freeze trap keep an enemy free of movement for X amount of seconds regardless of damage. 
<br>
<br>I also think we should be able to tame and train our own mount. However, I think it should be difficult to do this. Other classes can summon their own mounts, why should hunters not be able to tame their own?
<br>
<br>Also we need to be able to use ASPECT OF THE CHEETAH without any effects such as stun when hit. 
<br>
<br>Thanks

								Here is my own suggestions for making the hunter more enjoyable:
<br>
<br>First, correctly scale the weapon damage for the level 45-60 range.
<br>
<br>Second, Make it flashy. Make what the Hunter does LOOK impressive. 
<br>
<br>No actual changes are essential beyond these two. But as long as what the Hunter does is not visually dramatic, people are going to complain about how ineffective they feel. ;P

<br>Indeed, perhaps lower its cooldown and just make it an instant crit?  Also i really like the idea of pet barding/storage.  Perhaps one bag slot to make up for our lost space when using a quiver.

								Jaerogoth, while I do agree with some of the abilities you have suggested, such as pet equipment, and perhaps pet grappling (if dependant on pet str/size and opponent's str/size), several of them not only step on the toes of other classes but thoroughly grind the heel of the proverbial hunter's boot into them.  I can only assume that you haven't played too many classes beyond the hunter, which is fine, but it does mean that you need some to obtain some outside perspective from players of other classes, and here is some.
<br>
<br>The following are the suggestions that I have noticed have some serious problems, the reasons why, and what I think could be done to make it feasible:
<br>
<br><b>Head shot</b>:  This ability is simply overpowered, the only way it could ever even appear to be balanced is if you were stunned for like 10 seconds after you attempted the shot, regardless of hit or miss, otherwise there is no real risk involved because you can simply hit aspect of the cheetah and run away from your target only to come back and try it again later. Abilities that can kill independantly of HP, armor, resists, and stats in general simply cannot be balanced to everyone's liking in an mmo setting, in layman's terms, it pisses off everyone who can't instakill.  
<br>
<br><b>Aspect of the wolf</b>:  Were this ability to be implemented it would effectively amount to an open-handed slap in the face to rogues everywhere followed shortly by a swiftbackhand. Not only would rogues' <b>class-defining</b> ability no longer be unique to them, but hunters would be able to dole it out to anyone in their group.  Here is an ability I have been thinking about for hunters that would be much less offensive and coincide much better with the hunter ethos:
<br>
<br><b>Stalking</b>:  Hunter activates stalking on his target, the target shows up on the hunter's minimap and the hunter gains stealth versus the target in a similar manner to rogue's lvl 1 stealth (60% move speed, easily detected by higher level enemies, and more easily detected the closer the hunter gets to his target, any attacks made by the hunter or on the hunter remove the effect as well as any casting done by the hunter).  However, the stealth is only versus that target, meaning that you are not stealth from any other players or mobs, also, if the hunter is within the line of sight of the target an icon is placed on the target's buff bar called &quot;stalked&quot; so that players being stalked know that they are being stalked if the hunter is not careful to stay out of the player's LoS through terrain usage or maintaining a position behind the target, even if they do not actually detect the hunter's exact location.
<br>
<br><b>Alpha leader</b>:  This is nearly as much of an insult to paladins as Aspect of the Wolf would be to rogues, paladins are the group benefit/leader class of WoW, not to mention they are already pretty miffed that hunters are getting talents before paladins, maybe if it allowed them to place an aspect on <b>one</b> other party member <b>instead</b> of the hunter it would be acceptable.
<br>
<br><b>Throw net</b>:  This ability would step directly into druid territory, copying one of their most notable abilities (Entangling Roots).   I could see this as a reagent-based &quot;oh crap&quot; instacast spell, 10-15 second duration, possibly randomized duration, 5 min cooldown, but I could never see it as Mana-only or low cooldown, also the damage would have to be negligible just like Entangling roots.

								I like the idea of Stealth as an aspect, but it needs to be inferior to rogue's stealth in some way.  Make the movement reduction considerable, perhaps 50%, or even &quot;standstill only&quot;.  Making it a group aspect is over the top.   
<br>

								&quot;Head shot: This ability is simply overpowered, the only way it could ever even appear to be balanced is if you were stunned for like 10 seconds after you attempted the shot, regardless of hit or miss, otherwise there is no real risk involved because you can simply hit aspect of the cheetah and run away from your target only to come back and try it again later. Abilities that can kill independantly of HP, armor, resists, and stats in general simply cannot be balanced to everyone's liking in an mmo setting, in layman's terms, it pisses off everyone who can't instakill.&quot;
<br>
<br>Heh, I thought this was overpowered until I read it fully. Yes it can kill the opponent, but it has a 60 minute cooldown which is huge. So you can *maybe* kill a person with a headshot every *60* minutes? That's not that overpowered.

								Head shot. Anything only usable every 60 minutes is not a class addition. Maybe it's an overpowered item idea...  Occaisonal PvP confrontation amidst questing might utilize this ability every 60 minutes, but that's not PvP. That's Hilsbrad.  In-battle PvP abilities should be geared towards FREQUENT use, as PvP is going to be long continuous battles on battlegrounds or in raids.
<br>
<br>That skill would be a great solo skill, for use as a back-up, desperation attack, but I don't think it would make much of a difference in PvP...less you had a whole line of Hunters unleash their one-shot's as a battle-opener :p That would be sick....

								And hunters would do that for PvP I assure you.  
<br>
<br>Ever play EQ? For a time there were entire groups based around an alternate advancement ability that wizards got called Manaburn.  There was relatively little cooldown time on it and it effectively took their Mana * X and did that much damage to the target, very low chance to resist.  I'm not sure what the multiplier was exactly but it was something like 5.  The average cap level wizard at that time had over 4000 mana, thats 20k damage * 6 wizards in a group = 120k damage = death to almost any mob in the game.
<br>
<br>Average 15% instakill chance * 5 players in a group = 75% chance to instakill someone, even if say hunters got it at lvl 20, and they could still group together and have a 25% chance to instakill lvl 60s.
<br>
<br>A much better idea would be to have an ability similar to Coldblood on rogues, guaranteed crit on the next attack every 3 minutes.

<br>
<br>this would be awesome and shoulda been thought of but will never work, (unless we can tame horses and such we see in a farm)  because the animation that blizzard would have to add for this would be huge.. the amount of beasts to add the riding animation on.. cant happen its a real shot in the dark =/ sadly.
<br>
<br>I really do like alot of your suggestions but not all are possible and if all were added it would make us gods ;)

								<blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br> The fundamental problems with the hunter (from what I have seen) are the low DPS, severe PvP weakness, ridiculously low pet damage, the inability to track, the inability to use stealth while stalking prey.  I’ve attempted to address some of these concerns (as I have read).  Blizzard could correct the DPS problem by simply creating arrows with elemental effects on them but this would still do nothing for the hunters ranged uniqueness as anyone could use arrows.  Additionally, the pet needs to be more of a fundamental threat to anyone who chooses to attack a hunter (PvP).  That is why I suggested a grapple attack for the pet, making is so no damage is dealt but the opponent is put in great danger by being immobilized.  As a primarily ranged fighter, it shouldn’t be unreasonable for the hunter to be able to improve the range of his attacks (possibly through talents).  Most hunter spells/abilities I have not changed, but the ones I have either changed or added I have tried to explain as clearly as possible.  Please don’t flame as these are merely suggestions for both Blizzards and our benefit, but I imagine constructive comments are helpful to blizzard…that being said I do like the “sneak peak” talents that blizzard posted earlier.
<br>
<br>
<br>PET ABILITIES 
<br>Call Pet: (unchanged)
<br>Beast Taming: (unchanged)
<br>Dismiss Pet: (unchanged)
<br>Revive Pet: (unchanged)
<br>Mend Pet: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>Equip Pet:  (new) allows you to equip barding (armour), saddle bags, and special weapons to your pet (metal claws, spiked plates, etc.), making them a formidable fighting ally
<br>
<br>Tame mount:  (new) this ability allows the hunter to track and tame a beast that would be suitable as a mount.
<br>
<br>Grapple opponent:  (new) when the hunter is in melee with an opponent he can command his pet to grapple the opponent allowing him to back away or continue to attack.  The grapple lasts X seconds before the opponent breaks free – an ability like this is needed to correct the hunters innate PvP weakness, preventing people from simply ignoring the pet and attacking the hunter  
<br>
<br>
<br>ASPECTS
<br>Aspect of the cobra:  (new) the hunter takes on the aspect of the cobra, increasing his attack rate (melee/ranged) by X%.  This is recommended when the hunter finds himself in an overpowering situation and needs to strike fast and furious.  The effects stack with other rate enhancements (i.e. quivers)
<br>
<br>Aspect of the Cheetah:  (modified) The Hunter takes on the aspects of a cheetah, increasing movement speed.  This can be used to travel or to back away from monsters so you can use your ranged weapon. – currently the stun and extra damage taken make this a useless option in combat…mobs always seem to be able to catch up to me even if I have this active with a healthy lead.
<br>
<br>Aspect of the Pack: (modified) (group aspect) the hunter is able to confer on members of his group the aspect of the pack.  Through the use of commands and precise co-ordination the group then becomes a far more effective killing machine.  All members of the group have their attack damage (range/melee/spell), stamina and spirit increased by X%.  The group essentially becomes one large opponent due to their coordinated attacks.  (again, this improves a hunters usefulness in groups dramatically)
<br>
<br>Aspect of the wolf:  (new) the hunter is able to take on the aspect of the wolf allowing him to stalk prey unseen but reduces his movement speed to 60% of normal.  Attacking or generally provoking an enemy cancels the aspect.  (I don’t think the hunter should be able to confer this ability on group members but if it was, it would make things reeeeeally interesting…imagine a group of 5 stalking prey like a pack of wolves.  Perhaps if it was used in a group setting there would be a chance that it would fail exposing one or more of the members)
<br>
<br>Aspect of the Beast:  (unchanged) 
<br>Aspect of the Monkey: (unchanged) – (should be improved with talents to make mongoose bite useful and make the hunter more valuable in groups when he can confer aspects on other group members – warriors/pally’s/rogues would love us)
<br>
<br>BEAST SPELLS
<br>Scare Beast: (unchanged)
<br>Eagle Eye: (unchanged, but must be fixed as it rarely works…we always get the “no line of sight” message so I personally never use it and it should be useable indoors.  I tried to cast it while standing on a balcony and I got the “does not work indoors” message)
<br>Beast Lore: (unchanged) 
<br>
<br>Beast stalker:  (new) this spell allows the hunter to use his senses and keen insight to track hostile beasts.  When activated, beasts show up on the hunter’s mini map allowing him to plan his attack and stalk his prey.
<br>
<br>Beast meld:  (new) this spell gives the hunter the chance to learn a beast’s special/unique attack (similar to the beast taming ability).  The hunters armour is reduced by 100% for the 20 seconds it takes to learn its ability.  The hunter can only learn one attack at a time and the ability will remain with the hunter for 60 min (with a refresh of 30 seconds).
<br>
<br>
<br>MELEE SPELLS
<br>Dual-Wield (passive): (unchanged)
<br>Raptor Strike: (unchanged but more damage would be nice…the extra damage at the highest levels is fairly small)
<br>Wing Clip: (unchanged)
<br>Mongoose Bite: (unchanged but should have an improved chance by improving aspect of the monkey with talents)
<br>
<br>Ranged Combat
<br>Multi shot:  (modified) Fires multiple missiles all at once hitting a given target with three arrows or bullets. (Improved with talents.  i.e. 4 arrows, 5 arrows…)
<br>
<br>Head shot:  (new) While under the aspect of the wolf (stealth) the hunter is able to take his time in stalking his prey (aim) and make a devastating shot to the head of an opponent killing it instantly.  Head shot has a 10 sec “cast” rate and a 60 min refresh time.  The percentage chance is 15% plus or minus the difference in level’s between the target and the hunter (up to a max of +/- 10%).  For example a level 40 hunter stalking a level 50 opponent would have a 5% chance to kill an opponent (15%-10% = 5%), where as a level 40 hunter stalking a level 33 opponent would have a 22% chance (15% + 7% = 22%).  A failed shot misses the target and generates a large amount of agro.  (There’s risk and reward and it would be a valuable ability to a group looking to fight a horribly powerful boss or if a group member (mage/priest) was in trouble being attacked by a mob)
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – frost: (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with cold dealing an additional X damage and slowing the targets movement by Y% for Z seconds
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – fire:  (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with fire dealing an additional X damage and burning the target for an additional Y damage for Z seconds.
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – disease: (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with a debilitating disease dealing an additional X damage and damaging the target for an additional Y damage for Z seconds.  Additional beasts that come within 2 yards of the afflicted beast catch the disease as well possibly spreading the disease even farther.
<br>
<br>Imbue arrow – lightning:  (new) The hunter is able to magically imbue arrows with electrical energy dealing an additional X damage.  The lightning will jump to any other nearby beasts (within 5 yards) and deal 50% of the initial damage to them.
<br>
<br>Auto Shot: (unchanged)
<br>Serpent Sting: (unchanged)
<br>Viper Sting: (unchanged)
<br>Arcane Shot: (unchanged)
<br>Scorpid Sting: (unchanged)
<br>Volley: (unchanged)
<br>Hunter's Mark: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>TRAPS
<br>Immolation Trap: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>Frost Trap: (unchanged – even though is has extremely limited usefulness since damage breaks the trap.  I’ve used it once, and that was just to see how it worked.  Personally I think it needs improvement, perhaps it should deal damage or be similar to a mages frost nova and keep an enemy or several enemies in an area immobilized for X seconds)
<br>
<br>Explosive Trap: (unchanged)
<br>
<br>
<br>OTHER
<br>Throw net:  (new) The hunter magically conjures a net of vines and thorns that he then throws at a given target, immobilizing it for X seconds and dealing Y damage from the thorns over the duration of the net.
<br>
<br>Alpha leader (passive):  (new) The hunter takes on the persona of an alpha leader allowing him to lead and guide members of his GROUP through subtle body language and hand signals.  This allows the hunter to cast any of his known aspects on other GROUP members.  If an individual leaves the group they loose the benefit of the aspects.
<br>
<br>Disengage: (unchanged)
<br>Feign Death: (unchanged)
<br>Flare: (unchanged)
<br>Rapid Fire: (unchanged)
<br>Mail: - The ability to wear mail armour should be lowered to at least level 30.  The hunter has to spend a large amount of money on pets, arrows, food, and equipment.  Lowering the mail requirement to 30 would give the hunter the “breathing room” to spend slightly less on his armour (leather) just to throw it out at a certain level when mail is available.
<br>
<br>
<br>TALENTS – Several of the above spells/skills/abilities are very open to improvement from talents.  For example, the three trees could be:
<br>
<br>Pet talents: blood frenzy (increase the pets attack and defense), matriarch (allows the hunter to call multiple pets at a time), Special attacks, undying loyalty (when the hunter is physically attacked by a mob the pet enters a berserk state to protect his master by increasing the frequency of its learned traits/abilities like growl/bite), etc.
<br>
<br>Ranged combat:  Improved fire damage, improved cold damage, improved lightning damage, improved disease damage, Recover projectiles (allows the hunter to recover X% of projectiles imbedded in a corpse he killed), increased ranged attacks, etc.
<br>
<br>Beast talents:  empathize with pet (the hunter experiences a boost in stats/damage/armour/speed – whatever is appropriate for the pet he has) while his pet is active.  This makes the pet more of a companion than simply a meat shield and the pets death will negatively affect the hunter with some sort of decrease to a stat/armour etc., improved stalking, improved aspects, Increase the number of active aspects (this would allow a hunter the ability to have multiple aspects active, and at higher levels when he has alpha leader, confer multiple bonuses on group members), butcher beast (recover a small amount of food from a slain beast for his pet) <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>These are billiant i wish i would have saw this Before i made a thread.I completely disagree with
<br>Ripping the rogues skill Headshot should be an opener and *Tradeskill for hunters*Net knitting makes nets that do different things like shock and snare and trip batman style.Imbue ammunition is Great. Tame mount is overpowering.Equip pet sounds good but might need balancing *A bear in plate EEEEE$%$$%$*.That cobra aspect is a nice touch.Grapple could be changed to a pet ability found thru taming.Beast meld would be great if you made it you learn that Beast's ablilty to teach your pet.The Mail idea would be cool but overpowering.

								Great feedback.  Like I said though, they are merely ideas that blizzard (I hope) would toy with or consider.  I'm sure I'm not too good at the whole balancing thing but I'm confident that whatever blizzard does to the hunter it'll still be a pretty cool class.  
<br>
<br>Personally I dont think that a hunter having a &quot;stealth&quot; ability will be stomping on the toes of rogues (I plan on playing a rogue during rettai) since I believe other classes have similar abilities...i.e. druids, shamans.  It just seems like such a natural thing for a hunter to do.  I don't think an individual whose sole purpose in life is to hunt prey would live very ling if he was only able to crash through the forest like a bulldozer.  I still think that even though it would be wild to be able to stealth a group of players, I know that this would be waaaaay over the top (but good lord would I have fun haha)
<br>
<br>I know that I was grasping at straws with the whole head shot thing though.  I'm sure there is a way to make it work (I really like the critical damage idea that was brought up).  I essentially modeled the idea after the arcane archer in D&amp;D.  with them you can buy arrows of slaying that kill instantly with no chance to resist.  For WoW something like that wouldn't work but a toned down version of a &quot;sniper&quot; type shot with cooldown/stunn recovery/low chance could work in WoW.
<br>
<br>As for the mounts, I'm pretty sure Blizzard could add the ability for a hunter to train his own mount without much trouble.  The creatures already exist as far as animations are concerned.  for example in Darnassus you can train to ride these huge white tigers (sorry, cant remember what they are called).  All blizzard would have to do is put some of these animals in a snowy, high level area and make them violent.  While other classes could encounter them and kill them, a hunter could choose to travel to this area and risk taming one (which should be hard as hell).
<br>
<br>I believe it was Raichon that brought up the alpha leader being bad for palidins.  I feel that something like this wouldn't necessarily be bad for palidins since the abilities that a hunter could confir on a group would be totally diferent than a palidins.  While I havent seen very many palidins, it seems that their &quot;auras&quot; ar more concerned with health, damage and armour.  A hunter could be more concerned with dodging, speed, and attack rate.  Combining these two classes in a group would probably become the norm for people.  Additionally, any group with a warrior tank or rogue would love to have the extra X% dodge bonus a hunter could add.  One way or another, if a hunter cant help out his team mates in a group (with something other than ranged attacks) then nobody will want a hunter in their group.  Personally, when I'm in a group I try to go all out and pelt off as many arrow effects, set as many traps and go toe to toe as often as possible because I dont want the hunter to be thought of as a useless class.  We need something to bring to the group, hence the ability to augment our team mates (and only our team mates).
<br>
<br>Personally, I'm hoping that Blizzard sees this and  even if they only take one or two ideas into consideration, I will still see it as an improvement to a class that is (as of this moment) lacking in possibilities.

								I was talking to my roommate about hunter aspects, his main is a 32 hunter, and he informed me that most aspect spells already have a group version, he mentioned that specifically aspect of the monkey (dodge increase) and aspect of the hawk (ranged attack power increase) do not.
<br>
<br>Also while druid stealth in cat form is fairly substantial, shaman stealth in wolf form is practically useless.  Rogue stealth is certainly much more effective than either (and it should be).<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Raichon ]<br></font></small>
