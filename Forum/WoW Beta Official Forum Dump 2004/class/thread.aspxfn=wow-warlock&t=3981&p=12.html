								I will be reinforcing what others have already said here, but I think that it's important to have as many people petition these changes as possible.
<br>
<br>
<br>Soul Shards should definitely be more valuable than they are now.  I agree that if Banish requires one that we should either be able to use Banish more than once, or the recast time should be nerfed big time.
<br>
<br>Soul Shards should be stackable.
<br>
<br>The damage for pets is pathetic.  Since the pets are the MAIN deal for Warlocks, they should be something to reckon with.  Right now they are basically only used to get hit so I'm not being smacked down.  That's not cool... they should have some positive outlooks, not just fear of negative on yourself.  
<br>
<br>The VW needs a makeover.  Right now he looks more like a blob than a VOID walker.  I know Blizzard can do better with effects in making this character.  I like the idea of the black smoke emitting from underneath him... why not make the VW more like the Shade in WC3 except bigger?  I like the look of transparency and &quot;nothing&quot; that the shades had in WC3.
<br>
<br>More spells and abilities for pets would be nice.
<br>
<br>DoTs need to stack, period.  Many times over people have said that Warlocks are basically useless in group situations because their pets suck, the DoTs are useless because the creep is dead before the DoT takes even half effect, and they have no real nukes.
<br>
<br>DoTs need to do greater damage.  Twice the damage that they do now, at least.
<br>
<br>Curses need to be buffed as well.  They just aren't worth casting.  
<br>
<br>More than one curse per target needs to be implemented.  What's the point of having TONS of curses when, in reality, you will only use the same few over and over.  The rest are useless unless they can be stacked with other curses.
<br>
<br>A cool implementation would be to allow Warlocks to have buffs for themselves that also have a negative impact.  Since Warlocks are supposed to be dabbling in the dark arts, it makes sense that with conjuring a great dark power comes negative traits as well.  For example, give Warlocks a 20% faster cast rate (which would get higher for different levels of this spell) for exchange of draining the Warlock's life... or giving them negatives to traits or armor.

								As a Bump, I also wanted to coment on my previously suggested spell Demon grip,
<br>
<br>&quot;Demon Grip- a CC spell for the Warlock, Holds target in place and does minor DoT (curse of agony anyone?) Also is a channeling spell, So in a group, a Warlock can sacrifice his spellcasting time, for the sake of holding an oponent in place.This wouldnt be so bad, since the warlock can still always control his pet. &quot;
<br>
<br>A spell like this would definatly up the value of having 2 warlocks in a group, or two warlocks grouping together, because after the DoTs are on, one warlock can grip the mob, and make it immobile (a channeling spell, so it would run out eventually) and also be doing DoT, while the other Warlock can keep the immolation present, Do Life drain/Soul drain if needed, or nuke with Shadow Bolt. ALL the while both pets of the warlocks are attacking the mob also.
<br>
<br>Definatly make Demon grip a higher lvl spell, I'd say anywhere lvl 20ish or higher, and then groups of warlocks could do great dmg. Especially in PvP, two warlocks travelling together, and come across a mage and warrior, Grip the warrior, fear the mage, pet attack and DoT the warrior, kill him, by the time the mage comes back, Bash him.
<br>
<br>Note: I havent detirmined if Grip would halt the action of the target aswell, going with the assumption that it may be too powerfull the above scenario was based on the assumption that it does, thus there would be no sense in using Demon Grip on a mage, as he could nuke you. 
<br>
<br>Anyway, I'd love to see this in game, because as the poster after my original post (Feiralas, page 9 of the warlock suggestion thread) mentioned, It's very much like, force grip, which come to think of it, would be very cool to have, I think this is overall a nice ability to the warlock. (Mainly adds a group incentive)

								1. I agree, shards should be stackable. 
<br>
<br>2. You either shouldn't lose conjured items when logging, or you should get your shards back. All this does is punish those of us that can only play a little at a time.
<br>
<br>4. I personally like the void walker model, but it would be nice to change the color for your pets (i.e. the void walker's blue, or the imp's fire color, etc).
<br>
<br>5. The void walker always walks towards the camera whenever I kill something in PvE. This makes it hard to loot the body because it always gets right it the way. I think it's because it's pathed to follow behind my character, but it follows a little too close and gets between the camera and my loot.
<br>
<br>6. Sacrifice Pet, should be available on all pets.
<br>
<br>7. One minor shout damage spell would be nice to get snake, bug, and other cast pets off. There could be a high mana cost to balance this or perhaps when you cast it you'd be stunned for a second or two.
<br>
<br>8. It would be nice when Talents are added to have the option to increase distance on some of the draining spells. Though, I think it's pretty balanced to have it so short now.
<br>
<br>9. Some sort of crowd control would be nice. Perhaps something that causes skeletal hands to come out of the ground and hold the enemies, but that breaks on damage. Perhaps this could only be done when a pet is not under our control. That would give us another way to play when our pets die.
<br>
<br>10. Pets should be nameable (though the name wouldn't have to be unique).
<br>
<br>11. I don't think I should be able to heal my demons with first aid. It seems a little odd the idea that I'm putting bandaging on my warlock pets, since they're ethereal. Maybe at higher levels of First Aid this could be possible.
<br>
<br>12. Succubus needs more damage.
<br>
<br>13. Our DOTs feel a little weak for the amount of time it takes to cast. It would be nice to have the option to either make them stronger or faster to cast via Talents.
<br>
<br>That's all I can think of so far. Or course, right now I'm only level 26, so some of these could be there as I get higher in level. Please forgive me if this is the case. I welcome any feedback or ideas. I'm enjoying playing with everyone. See you in the game.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Rydel ]<br></font></small>

								Okay, after reading every single post on this thread I’m gonna chime in and agree with a lot of people, and make some suggestions of my own. Hopefully you don’t get too bored. =P
<br>
<br>I think it would be awesome if banish had some cooler graphics. Actually, not for me, but for the banished person. I'm thinking something along the line of how it is when you are dead, but not blue/white. Perhaps faded/blurry color and distorted sound? Or maybe background is blue/white but character models are in faded color. Other suggestions for banish…like sending someone to another dimension, instant kill or whatever, just aren’t possible because of pvp. Sending a player to another REAL dimension would require a loading screen, the spell would wear off before the screen finished loading heh.
<br>
<br>I also think that warlocks should be able to attack banished people, if this would be integrated with banish effects; the banished person would see distorted explosions and stuff. Also, banishes cool down is STILL too long. Come on, 5 mins would be awesome, but I'd settle for 10 mins. I don’t necessarily mind the soul shard but what sucks is if banish is resisted, you're not only out a soul shard, but you are out 20 minutes waiting to try to use it again.
<br>
<br>Can we get a larger cast range? I’d like 30 yards like mages. 10 yards might sound small but really it’s a big gap. If you party with one or more mages, you’ll find your self always trying to creep closer to a mob until you hit that 20 yard range. In this scenario, 2 things happen, mages are already dealing a good amount of damage by the time you get close enough to cast, or the mob runs right past you. 
<br>
<br>I can’t count how many times I’ve been fighting something (this happens most solo at close range, but also in groups, especially if someone being agroes is running around in crazy trying outrun/not be attacked.) when it decides to run past me right when my shadow bolt is about to fire, causing me to not fire it because they aren’t in front of me. Maybe this is just me?
<br>
<br>I agree with stacking dots, but I'd also like to have only one curse per warlock removed. I'd like to see some kind of mass curse/dot (maybe a talent?)
<br>
<br>I'm jealous mages can make mana stones, any thoughts for warlocks getting this instead of mages and having it be distributable like soulstones and  healthstones? Also, what’s with Soul/Healthstones vanishing on relog? I can agree with this on conjured food and drink because it doesn’t require a regeant. I wish this would be changed back to the way it was.
<br>
<br>I'm a warlock who pretty much uses my imp 95% unless party wants my succ for a little help with CC. I just only did my vw quest at like 34 but just so I could have the pet, I don’t really use it or plan too unless it’s buffed some. 
<br>
<br>I’d like to train pet skills without having to train previous ranks. Why is this anyways? No other classes have to train previous ranks or spells and effects. 
<br>
<br>As stated many times, imps fear should be removed. There is nowhere safer then being at your master’s side. But, if this &quot;feature&quot; is in for good, then yes, imps need to know their surroundings and stay like 25-30 yards away from hostile targets.
<br>
<br>
<br>I'd like to see more spells for my imp besides its fireball. Maybe a fireblast/immolate combo would be nice. I also think fire shield should not have been decreased. I need to be able to control my ptes attack more. Once the imp is starting its attack you can’t stop it, this can be dangerous sometimes if you have targeted the wrong target, or a target that is in a big crowd. I really like bloodpact. Invis would be nice as an option for all pets. I wish there was another buff imps could give, not sure which type of buff, spirit or intellect comes to mind though. Since I’m an imp fan, I’d like maybe to see my imp grow a bit as it/I level. I remember the warlock in the slaughtered lamb used to have a grell. Now, I don’t want a grell, just want my imp to bulk up a big. Just a though.
<br>
<br>How about a group buff from the succubus? Maybe a spirit buff since she’s so sexy heh.
<br>
<br>The random bug with pets where they automatically start attacking a monster after they are summoned happens to my imp too.
<br>
<br>I'm not sure where I stand on the soulshard issue. I'm afraid of the bag situation where it simply isn't big enough. Generally, I horde them and stock as many as I can, if I need inventory space, I'll throw one out. On average though, I TRY to keep at least 12 on me at anytime but in parties 20+ since they are easier to get when you aren't alone. If soulshards could stack even if only 2 per stack that would help tremendously.
<br>
<br>I feel shadow bolt could welcome a faster cast time. 2.5 or 2.75 instead of 3 maybe?
<br>
<br>Channeling spells: 
<br>
<br>I would like to have an HP bar for channeling spells so you are not interrupted in one hit. Or, channeled spells only use a pro-rated amount of mana based on how long the spell was channeled. This way we don’t lose 40% of our mana for being interrupted right when we cast the spell. I also think that Rain of Fire could do a little more damage. I guess mainly because usually it doesn’t last long enough before I get interrupted.
<br>
<br>It would be awesome if detect invis worked like other sense skills and it showing a bleep on the mini map. Maybe a faded orange dot or something.
<br>
<br>Improve Demon Armor or maybe stack skin/armor like mages can stack one 2 of their frost and ice armor.
<br>
<br>Shadow Ward seems kind of useless. Not many mobs do shadow damage, it doesn’t last for very long, and you can’t cast it on other people. But who cares right? How often do you need shadow protection, the only mob that comes to name is Balgaras the foul in Dun Modr, however, you’ve most likely already killed him by the time you get Shadow Ward rank one.
<br>
<br>Drain spells. The only one I’m using this phase is Drain mana rank 3 (so far anyways). Is these spells primarly to just “drain” a targets mana or life? As it stands now, it’s definitely not beneficial to the warlock. The spell costs more mana then it returns I think. I’d like to see improvements here. I’ve pretty much been boycotting drain life because it’s just not strong enough; I’ve been considering rank 4 but nor sure if I really wanna do that. I think draining spells could receive a 20% increase without them becoming “overpowered”. Also, increase the duration.What do you guys think? OR, what might be really cool is to do chain drain spells, I think this would work best with drain life since it’d be likely that your entire mob doesn’t have mana, and also with drain soul since there are many times in a group when there are 2 or more targets with low health and I drain soul them and try to catch the next target before it dies. Maybe bouncing from targets 5-10 yards away would be good.
<br>
<br>Immolation is false advertising. Actually, Immolation, as is in WC3, is supposed to be like hellfire without the damage to you. I propose adding aoe effect to immolated targets, maybe 5-10 yards and 10%dps of the ranks initial damage. Also adding immolation to those affected by Rain of Fire would be cool.
<br>
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>Ultimus - “Hellfire is one of the best AE spells in the game. Imo, it should be the most damaging AE spell in the game. I propose changing the way the spell works. Make the AE take MORE of the Warlock's hp but have an INFINITE duration. The HP cost would be significantly increased and so would the damage. This could create some interesting strategies -- Keep the Warlock alive and he creates serious DPS.”<hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>This is an AWESOME idea. I also like your Curse Combo ideas.
<br>
<br>I’d like to see auto cast on wands like there is on standard melee attack/daggers/swords.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>swizzle –“3. Drain Soul 
<br>Should slow the target due to his soul being relinquished.”<hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote> This would be great, slowed target movement/damage 2-25% based on rank.
<br>
<br>
<br>Oh yeah, forgot to mention. I think it would be great to have a L40 armor upgrade, but I think &quot;mithril&quot; would be more fitting since it is lighter than plate. This would also be an excellent upgrade to what is lacking in artisan tailoring.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by CalvinKlein ]<br></font></small>

								Hmm I do want some improvement on our armor effect.
<br>
<br>The regen on our armors needs to improve per level or in return be a self dam shield, or a particular status effect on different classes, miss rate, fizzle rate etc.
<br>
<br>Our pets should also give benefits to us alone as said in previous posts. 
<br>
<br>Last thing that irks me the most is when were on our nightmare we lose our pet, allow us to keep our pet &amp; let the nightmare strafe, as i've heard normal mounts can but we can't as of yet.
<br>
<br>A spell needs to be implemented for each pet that is in regards to there physical appearence, dam absorbtion from fire spells for the imp or a chance to heal, VW glues himself to mob &amp; leeches hp or soemthing, &amp; succubus needs to use her wings to float around &amp; lash at something :P
<br>
<br>Hehe and while were at if we get to keep pets up while were on our nightmare, imp should sit on top of his head, voidwalker should sorta glue himself on, &amp; succubus should be flyin about, otherwise wats the point of the wings? :)
<br>
<br>Edit: The only thing shadow ward is good for atm is pvp against priests, a realization i made not to long ago (sad really). It basically eats there dot &amp; maybe a mind blast if u dont instant cast.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Meralda ]<br></font></small>

								I would like to have every pet have a buff much like the imps stamina buff for example. The succubus, our dmg dealing pet, gives all our spells a 10% dmg boost, the voidwalker, our tank, gives us a reduce threat lvl buff or and armor buff that stacks with demon armor. Fel hound, supposedly our magic pet, lowers casting time on spells. These would make the pets much more usefull then they are now because now fear kiting with no pet seems to be just as viable a soloing option for a warlock as taking the time to summon one.

								Well I agree with alot of the suggestions so far, I normally do in game suggestion myself.  And I have already commented on Blizzards lack of attention for the warlocks.
<br>
<br>My only suggestion for here that I didn't see already is to let us speak demonic.  I would really think that most of the warlocks spells would be chanted in demonic already.  This would allow another cross faction communication besides Common by Undead.  
<br>
<br>This would also void Curse of Tounges on warlocks but that is ok.
<br>
<br>Mages share common magics and spells, but look at all the mage races, they all either speak common or are decendants from azeroth continent.  Meaning that the history of this magic is locational, all to an area that was close to QuelThalas (&quot;was&quot; meaning it is no more). Mages could maybe get the ability to speak elven(not night elven, it would be alittle different from over the years), but Mage magics have been around and practiced there for long enough that it is most probable that it has been translated to Common and Troll(Trolls have a long history vs elves).
<br>
<br>Warlocks, however, do not share common locational heritage like mages, and thier magics are alot newer to the species using them than mage magics.  So this may just be crazy or something, but wouldn't most warlock magics still be known in demonic, thus being spoken in demonic, and needing to understand demonic in order to speak/cast spells.
<br>
<br>Plus I would like to know how my Imp is bad mouthing me in demonic, and it would be useful later on, like maybe getting a warlock only quest from Varimathras, or other demons/cultists/factionneutralnpcs. 
<br>Plus Curse of Tounges doesn't do much against a warlock as it is, waiting for DoT's doesn't require much recast.

								Soul shards should be consumable directly as if they were healthstones; less hassle, and you can keep your stack of soulshards on your hotbar, and not have it vanish when you use a healthstone.
<br>
<br>Also, it means it's easier to trade them out to party members, than having to do the annoying create/trade one at a time.
<br>
<br>Healthstones are a nice benefit, but they are just too inconvenient to use much in a party, especially if they are being used by the recipients.  This change would remove a lot of the hassle.

								<tr><td valign="top"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" border="0"><tr><td valign="top"><div class="breakWord"><span class="gray">
								I've read through most of the posts made and I'm going to disagree and agree with some of the stuff mentioned plus throw in some new ideas hopefully.  The suggestions and improvements I'm going to list do not take into account the current talents in the game.  They are meant to bring warlock up to the same level as top classes are without the added benefit of talents.
<br>
<br>DOTs: Stacking yes, absolutely.  Have priest and Druid dots stack too.  In fact all dots even if they're weapon dots and two people in group are using the same weapon.  With the current system pure DD based classes &quot;Mage&quot; are benefitting the most.  Level the playing field by allowing DOT stacking for every class with no cap on the number of stacks.  So if X number of a class are casting on the same target, they can have X number of the same dot going on that target.  All except curse dots, namely Agony since it is a curse.
<br>
<br>Someone mentioned DOT combos generating an extra DOT with curses.  While it's an interesting idea, DOT stacking is a much simpler and effective solution which as I mentioned would benefit all dot classes not just warlocks.
<br>
<br>Also on the subject of dots.  It's annoying to find or craft items that say: Adds X damage to Fire/Shadow/Nature spells and effects and have it only work for DD spells.  Once again this system is skewed to the DD based classes &quot;Mage&quot;.  If my Shadow Hood says adds 6 damage to all shadow spells and effects, well then why doesn't my Corruption/Agony have an extra 6 damage every tick?  Or if the Robe of Power adds 4 to all magical attacks and effects, how come my Immolate/Corruption/Agony/Rain of Fire/Hellfire don't get that 4 damage bonus each tick?  The only thing affected is my DD Shadowbolt.  So allow these item bonuses to work on dots, wave spells (blizzard/rain of fire/hellfire etc.)  This would benefit all casting classes not just &quot;Mage&quot;.
<br>
<br>Dain Life:  To the person that suggested the first tier, level 14 drain life be removed.  NO! As little life as it draws, it's still useful for fear tactics and when you're low on life.  The only thing about drain life is that the absorbtion on it should be 25% more at all tiers.  Secondly I'd like the wave damage to be shown again as it was a long time ago.  Have the numbers show above the targets head as the life is being drained like it used to be displayed.  Right now I can't even tell if the spell is draining the amount is supposed to be draining.  On the subject of channeling in particular, it would more suitable to have it part of our talent line that we could decrease the chance of a channel spell breaking on hit, like Mages have for their Arcane line.  This method should be employed for all classes that have channel based spells.  It's fair right across the board.  
<br>
<br>Drain Soul: I agree the damage dealt by this spell doesn't make it worth the mana cost to use the higher level versions.  Perhaps if the damage dealt was done every 2 seconds instead of 5 it would make this spell more useful to upgrade.  Secondly it should work on the same Talent system but not as a separate branch.  You spec in the Destruction line to have channeling interrupt less up to the equivalent of the mage interrupt decrease then it affects both Drain Life and Drain Soul.
<br>
<br>Someone suggested Invisibility... I gotta say no to that one.  It's a Mage defining spell, and there's no justification for the warlock to have it.  We can see invis, and that's balanced.
<br>
<br>Banish: Great spell and unique effect.  Timer is too long on it as others have mentioned. Drop it down to 10min timer.
<br>
<br>Soul Shards:  Make them stack already.  Stacks of 5 would be perfect.  It's so annoying having no inventory space.  With Quest items clogging up space and if you toss on a tradeskill's regeants, I have no bag space left to pick up the good items that drop every now and then.  Soul Shards aren't some peripheral thing to the warlock class, it's an integral part of our spells.  At least shamans can cast a whole spell line of totems based on one totem regeant.  5 different warlock spells require soul shards.  Pets/Banish/Summon/Healstone/Rezstone.  That's 6 of them you have to be carrying around if you just want to have the ability to cast one of each of those spells.  This also alleviates the reclaiming pets concern.  Once warlocks can stack these things, it won't matter that traveling gets rid of a pet or two since they could afford to keep at least a stack of these in their backpacks at all times.  I would personally keep two.
<br>
<br>Curse of Recklessness:  I never use this curse.  Weakness is almost always preferred.  I'd rather time a shadowbolt right as a mob flees than take away my ability to fear it unless I cancel it out with another curse.  As someone mentioned above, if a mob is now immune to fear then it should also be locked onto the target it has when recklessness hits.  For PvE this curse would become very useful.  It also alleviates the voidwalker taunting problem.  In groups, warlock would become much more useful since he could keep mobs off the healer by putting recklessness once they're on the main tank.
<br>
<br>Curse of Agony:  I think this curse is fine, I use it when fear kiting and to stack curses in groups.  Its an extra dot.  The timer is a little long, but I'd rather have this spell left as is in favor of fixing the other spells.  All this needs is a shorter timer, but it isn't such a big deal.
<br>
<br>Hellfire:  This is a great spell idea except someone forgot to think it all the way through.  First of all it takes 2 seconds to cast before it even begins channeling. Secondly it requires channeling.  Now it also deals damage to the caster which already has low hitpoints and at the same time generates alot of hate.  Plus it also breaks when you get hit.  So this is a pretty useless spell.  The core concept is great, but the implementation makes it a waste to buy and suicide to use.  So first of all, since it is a PBAoE why does it have a casting timer on it?  The damage is dealt over 10 seconds so it's not instant, and thus not overpowered.  Make it an insta cast, even on the move.  As a channeling spell it limits movement and thus also limits radius after time of casting.  Well instead of it being a 10 sec channeling spell.  Have it as a 10 sec buff effect only self targetable.  Yah, you read right.  Instant cast like a curse but it's a buff effect on the caster.  Meaning he could run around on fire if the targets are moving around.  Secondly it could be canceled as all buffs are by a right click before the duration runs out.  Also, here's a poignant question.  Why would I choose to deal 390 damage to a target while dealing 260 to myself at first rank? By that time I can cast a 150 shadowbolt without ever hurting myself.  So why not make the damage dealt to damage taken ratio something plausible and advantageous?  Say 10 damage to the caster per second or even no damage at all to the 39 dealt out? With these changes all of sudden Hellfire is a useful and potent spell.  And since we get it so damn late anyway, it might as well be useful and potent. 
<br>
<br>Curse of Weakness: It was already mentioned that this curse doesn't seem to work properly and I'd like to reaffirm that.  I too have noticed that it only reduces damage by about 75% of what it is supposed to according to the description.
<br>
<br>Sense Demons: I have to disagree with the person who posted that it should be removed since it costs only 5 skill points from the trainer.  I think most warlocks would agree that they'd rather pay 60s for the spell than 5 skillpoints.  Skillpoints are far more precious than money.  So no, don't remove it.  Instead move it to level 40 along with Enslave Demon.
<br>
<br>Enslave Demon: Useless spell. No ifs ands or buts, just useless in its current form.  As I just mentioned, move this spell to level 40 since this is the level when warlocks don't get a new pet.  I assume since Felhunter is supposed to be level 30, that Infernal would be level 50.  Therefore at 40 the warlock gets Nightmare, which isn't a pet.  So put Enslave Demon at level 40 to make up for the lack of pet.  Increase the mana cost substantially and make it a permanent thing.  With the exception that the warlock can't enslave something above his level.  No chance to break free, nothing.  Just simply another method of getting a pet.  This would still be a limited use spell due to the rarity of demons among various zones.
<br>
<br>Imp: Remove the AI on this thing.  It should just sit where it is and do what it's told.  I'm sick of it running off for no damn reason sometimes.  I understand it has to get in line of sight, but the imp has caused several group wipes in instances because I took my eye off it for a brief second.  Everything else is fine about the imp.  The damage shield could use a little more damage but that's about it.  This pet would be fine for both PvP and PvE.
<br>
<br>Voidwalker: This pet is great, and by far the most widely used.  However I agree with a previous poster that instead of a mana bar it should have a rage bar, and torment would be rage based.  The other thing is that this pet deals a max of 9 damage to anything of equivalent level to it, at any level.  That's pretty sad.  An enrage ability that was previously mentioned would bring this pet's damage to an accetable level. That still leaves the Voidwalker with very limited PvP usefulness.  I suggest adding a Hamstring type attack to its list of powers.  One of the most annoying things as a warlock is chasing down a fleeing enemy.  I basically have no way of really catching them or slowing them down.  My only hope is that I can get a fear off before the range is too far and then hope they run towards me. I don't agree with a previous poster who suggested adding a curse to our spell repetoire that would slow down movement.  That would make things too easy.  However a pet ability would limit the use of this snare ability and would make the voidwalker a desireable PvP pet.  Warrior has rushing charge/hamstring to deal with fleeing opponents. Priest has insta cast Mind Blast and insta cast dot.  They can simply chase and nuke till the runner is dead.  Mage has frostbolt/nova/sheep. Druid has Roots/sprint in catform.  Rogue has crippling poison/sprint.  Shaman has earth totem/insta nukes.  Even paladin has the fist of justice stun.  So this is a reasonable request.  Hamstring type ability for Voidwalker.  This even goes along with the warrior nature of the Voidwalker, and would work great as a rage based ability.
<br>
<br>Succubus: This pet is extremely weak compared to what it used to be.  Meele attacks are ok, but it should be about 10 damage more per hit.  Lash of Pain is a joke.  It's maybe 8 damage more than a regular attack, and it has to hit from the rear.  I guess this is supposed to be the &quot;Rogue&quot; type pet, but if you're going to put in a backstab like ability, then give it some power.  I remember when lash of pain used to hit for 120 at first rank, and that was overpowered for sure.  But an 80 damage hit at first rank and decent upgrades like 160 2nd and 240 3rd is just about right.  It would also make it worthwhile for the warlock to position the succubus behind its target.  As it stands, I agree with a previous poster who wrote that it's not worth the trouble it takes to position the succubus behind its target for the paltry extra damage a lash of pain would do.  If Lash is left at the current damage, then at least remove the timer off it completely.  That solves the problem too. Once again this is a useful pet for both PvP and PvE.
<br>
<br>Fellhunter Suggestions: I assume as everyone else does that it will have Mana Burn as it is fabled to.  My only suggestion is that it be made a decent amount of damage, at least over 100.  This is justified because it would work only against monsters/players with mana.  Monster wise that's probably not even half the monsters in the game considering all the wildlife that runs around each zone.  A nice Fellhunter ability would be lets say &quot;Resistant Skin&quot; which would absorb 50% of any magical damage directed at the Fellhunter.  It's an anti-magic pet so it makes sense in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Infernal Suggestions:  I haven't the slightest clue what the devs have in mind for this pet.  However I see it as a combo of all the other pets.  Imp type Fireshield ability.  80% of VW health and tanking ability.  Succubus meele damage(the improved kind I mentioned earlier). 25% magic damage absorbtion (Half the Fellhunter mentioned above).  It would also need a little something extra. I can think of nothing more appropriate than a warlock first rank Hellfire ability(the improved kind I have suggested earlier.)  The thing looks like it's on fire anyway.  Now that's a pet that is hard to ignore in PvP.

								I can answer ur question on why a DoT does not get the bonus dmg added every tick Sarnon its because it would be far to powerfull. At the moment you can get well over 70 or 80 dmg added to shadow spells. do you know what that would do to a DoT if it were added to every tick? corruption would hit for 1000's of dmg if every tick it had did 100 dmg or more. If you dont believe u can get that high a dmg lemme explain how. Xtreme Power goggles +11, Elemental raiment +10, Black mageweave gloves +6, Swampchill fetich +11, shadow weave bracers +3, Star belt +3, Diabolist's Blade +3, and potion of shadow power +40 thats +87 dmg to all shadow spells. If that were added per tick to our Dot's it would be cool, but would unbalance a lot of things<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Lysander ]<br></font></small>

								I read through most of the feedback here and tried to offer more or less unique contributions. Bear in mind that I think if all these suggestions were implemented, the result would be an overpowered warlock. I see the class as potentially going in different directions, so have offered different kinds of feedback. 
<br>
<br>First things first: get our remaining pets done and in the game before working on anything else for the class other than major bug fixes. 
<br>
<br>Emphasize the training of core class skills. Require players to specialize in one or two rather than maxing all of them. This will provide for some diversity among members of the class; we’ll have warlocks who specialize in curses/destruction or destruction/demonology, etc. Training could be similar to Shadowbane’s, where you have a set number of trains per level and “spend” them at the class trainers, or like UO’s, where you set certain skills to go up (or down) as you fight, keeping others locked where they are. Implement a fourth skill (Summoning) that affects pet damage and overall effectiveness. This type of emphasis on class skills and specialization should be extended to all classes. 
<br>
<br>Each pet should be able to handle most conceivable situations, both PvP and PvE, while requiring different playstyles from the warlock. Here are a few suggestions: 
<br>
<br>The imp is a ranged attacker that buffs the warlock to be better able to tank for him, with a significant group stamina boost and a minor damage shield. He should stay within a certain radius of the warlock, and should not run in the event that he draws aggro—generally, only inexperienced or poor players do this in a group. His buffing should be more significant than it is now, enhancing the warlock’s melee capabilities dramatically. WC3 style immolation, that damages all opponents within melee range of the warlock, would be a nice addition. An increase in attack power and additional regeneration are other possibilities, or perhaps something that prevents the warlock’s spell casting from being disrupted by normal melee attacks. A warlock with an imp should be able to tank mobs of his level reasonably well. 
<br>
<br>The voidwalker is the reverse of the imp, and serves as a tank for the warlock. Many suggestions have been made for improving the VW’s function in this capacity, but I think all that is really necessary is that he have some way to effectively get aggro off the warlock if he draws it for whatever reason. I suggest an ability (Infuriate?) that would clear the subject mob’s hate list while forcing it to attack the VW. Cooldown should be relatively significant, perhaps in the order of five minutes. In PvP, it would force the targeted player to attack only the VW for something like 10-30 seconds, depending on rank. Targeting would immediately switch to the VW, and other hostiles would be non-targetable for this duration. 
<br>
<br>The succubus uses her abilities of beguilement and seduction to better allow the warlock to take his opponents down quickly and efficiently. Like many, I think a slight increase in damage is in order, and I also suggest that her AI be changed so that she more actively positions herself to use Lash of Pain. A vampiric aura like the WC3 Dreadlord’s would be appropriate and make her more party-friendly. She might do well to have a bit of a mouth on her, like the imp does, although her comments would be more sinister. 
<br>
<br>Warlocks directly channel the infernal energies of the Burning Legion, and should therefore have the most potential of any class for massive damage in a large area: AoE damage. Our AoE’s should be more devastating than the mage’s, simply put. We should also have AoE versions of curses and drains, as well as some form of shadow damage AoE. 
<br>
<br>Hellfire should damage all friendly characters as much as it does the warlock, while getting a significant bump to the damage it inflicts to opponents—this should be the most destructive AoE in the game by a wide margin, as has been suggested, but it doesn’t make sense that it damages the warlock but not any allies in the area of effect. I also think this should be uninterruptible except for attacks that would normally interrupt spellcasting. The visual effect of Hellfire needs work as well. My suggestion would be for the ground to crack and split, with gouts of flame pulsing up and setting all the affected opponents on fire, while less prominent flames lick at the lower portions of the warlock and affected allies. 
<br>
<br>Debuffing should be another of our specialties; make curses more significant overall. Give us a snare in the form of a curse—Curse of Lethargy, perhaps. Allow Curse of Recklessness to be cast on allies as well as enemies, as it could be considered a buff in certain situations. 
<br>
<br>Increase warlocks’ melee capabilities overall, turning us into more of a hybrid melee-caster class. Allow us to wear leather and use a greater range of melee weapons. The ability to use poison would fit well with the class flavor. 
<br>
<br>Eliminate Drain Soul. Add its soul-stealing effect to both Drain Life and Drain Mana. If an opponent dies while either drain is active, a soul shard is generated. 
<br>
<br>Add a persistent visual effect to Demon Armor, like a glowing green demonic sigil at the warlock’s feet, so that we can immediately tell when it has expired. This spell is vital the warlock’s survivability and should never be down for more than a moment.

								Lysander, dots do their damage gradually.  Ok so Corruption would hit for over 1k damage.  But by the time you can have all those items you've mentioned you're at a level where doing 100k+ damage over 40 seconds isn't uncommon.  Yes it makes dots much more powerful, but isn't it the point of all that equipment to make spells more powerful.  I'm trying to point out that the item bonus system is skewed towards the DD spell class, namely mage.  It would be to Shaman and Priest too if there were enough items with damage bonuses for their spell lines.
<br>
<br>If this truly turns out to be too powerful then just add the bonus gradually over the duration of the spell.  So corruption gets a bonus of 87 damage in the situation you described distributed over the length of the spell.

								a snare effect spell would be nice, when battling multiple mobs at low levels (which is common with the imp)  it'd be nice to have something that could get at least one of them off your back. 
<br>
<br>another direct damage spell sould be nice also,  i'm kinda sick of casting curses and then just casting shadow bolt till the creature dies.  
<br>
<br>and one thing that i never understood, if a warlock is a mage that delved too deep into his arts wouldn't it make sense that he is a little more advanced than a mage to start with?  maybe give them another weapon to start with like staves.   it seems fitting that a warlock would have a staff.  
<br>
<br>maybe even make a character start out as a mage then make the choice to become a warlock or keep on the rightous path and stay a mage.  like a duel class thing like D&amp;D.   
<br>
<br>one thing that's a must though,  make the void walker cool looking.  he looks like varuca salt from willy wonka after the roast beef dinner gum incident.  i would expect something a little more menacing.  more wraith like  (white wolf pen and paper game)  more scary.  i mean it's from the pits of hell right?  it's a demon of sorts, correct?  from a professional designer's point of view, i wouldn't be that scared if a big grape came rolling down on me.  now a misty demon from the 7th (hell even the 6th) layer of the inferno was seen following some guy through town i would give him some space.
<br>
<br>and make soul shards stackable.  i haven't run into the it yet but i can see how it's going to be a problem in the future.  as of now, i have a bag full of them, and i make a health stone, summon a void walker and cast a couple of spells and i'm down to 2.  or if i have enough, then i don't have enough room to grab loot and a quest item.  i've had a reasonably hard time making money because i have to throw out expensive loot so i can make room for a quest item.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Kraken ]<br></font></small>

								Looks:
<br>	I do agree with a lot of people that some changes need to be made to the graphics involved with the warlock. If warlocks are suppose to be related to demonic arts then our abilities should be much the same.
<br>
<br>	The Snare ability, if we get one, I think should be a lot like the druids entangle, but instead of roots coming out of the ground, fire should come up with hands reaching out and grabbing the person, and holding onto their legs or something.
<br>
<br>	The Imp, I really liked the idea of giving the imp the ability to morph into a huge demon that dose either massive damage or tanks. I think it’s a awesome way to make the imp seem more evil. “Oh look it’s a little cute demon, (imp morphs) oh crap!” Good way make the imp scary.
<br>
<br>	The VW instead of being a blue blob, could be black, transparent, and have more smoke coming out of the bottom. If he is transparent that let him have bones or a skull that kind of makes him look like a walking zombie blob.
<br>	Succubus doesn’t need much look wise, other then her wings look like they come out of her lower back instead of her upper back.
<br>
<br>	Demonic Armor, I liked the idea about it making our eyes glow with fire J. Makes us stand out from the mages, so we don’t all look the same. 
<br>
<br>	Maybe for  a warlock quest, give a reward that would be this cool black robe, with matching gap that folds over out head. It doesn’t need to have amazing stats or anything but it would be fun to walk around SW wearing an outfit like that. The robe plus the glowing eyes would make us looks awesome.
<br>
<br>	Nightmare, needs nothing, it is perfect!
<br>
<br>	Soul drain, would be cool, like many people said, if a ghostly image would come out of the body and into us, or our hand. I like the idea that draining their should would make them slow, but there is a exploit that you could use that ability any time to slow down our opponent. 
<br>
<br>I just really think that there needs to be something visualizing that separates us from mages, and priest. They all look the same so make us dark and evil looking, like we should be. Since we mess around with demons and stuff.

								Im only a 36 warlock but i have some own feelings about warlocks myself.
<br>
<br>1. Talent Skills for Uninterruptable Drain Magic(Drain soul, life &amp; mana): Without a shard, a warlock can hardly get shards from mobs by himself. An imp can hardly tank. neither can he aggro off the mobs from u nor can he suffer a few hit. Only when I met mobs like humanoid who flee at last can i get shard. But in more common situations, i need to get a group to get shards. And that's one reason for warlocks to get uninterruptable drain magic. I know it would be too power overwhelming for warlocks to have uninterruptable drain like in push 2, but an implemented talent skill would be great. 5 points to add in your uninterrupted drain magic TS and the maximum rate would be 75% chance to void an interrupt of drain or so.
<br>
<br>2. Much more HP should be added to warlocks. Warlock is also so weak because of it's hp. Warlocks just have a little more hp than mage, whose is lowest in game. Both warlock and mage cant heal themselves, but mages do much more dmg than a warlock, I just wonder how can a warlock win a mage in a duel. Take another scene as example, Im 30 and now i'm running across the barren land of Desolace from one kolkar tribe to another. Warriors can run through without a problem because they have quite a lot of hp. Mages can go invisible. Paladins and priests can heal themselves. Druids run fast and so do shamans. But what about a warlock? Only way they have to do is to summon a voidwalker to torment melee mobs off the master and that is only melee mobs, not a caster or a ranger. So i suggest a warlock's basic hp should be much more than a mage's or a priest's.
<br>
<br>3. Warlocks should be much more favorable for a group. Many warlocks felt they were alone in game because hardly any group like warlocks. When vs non elite mobs they are dead after i cast the first DOT, but when vs elite mobs dot dmg are so low. Some more magic should be implemented in game for warlocks. What i think are Amplify Damage like Necromancer's curse in Diablo II and Iron Madin like Necromancer's curse in Diablo II. Maybe the spell shouldnt be the same but there should be some spells like Mobs' own dmg vs Mob's hp or Mob's own hp vs Mobs' hp, or spells to descrase a certain rate of mobs' hp dmg or armor. Also i think fear is so stupid since mobs run around, i strongly recommend to add SLEEP back in game for warlocks as Dreadlords in WC3 have both sleep and infernal :=).
