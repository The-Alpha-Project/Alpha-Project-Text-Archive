								As previously stated, the Warlock has been placed on hold while the team is focused on getting the Hunter ready for the next patch.  The Warlock however, is not forgotten and will be worked on before the beta test nears completion.
<br>
<br>Besides adding additional Warlock pets, what are your suggestions for improving this class?  Before posting your suggestion, please think about how that change would affect the Warlock’s balance with both the environment and other classes.
<br>
<br>Thanks!

								give curse of agony a snare effect, this alone would make fear and CoA both much more usefull
<br>
<br>give them sleep back or change banish so it has a lower recast time (5-10 min) much harder to resist
<br>
<br>instant cast drain life but with a recast (3-5 min)
<br>
<br>succubus damage upgrade (both lash of pain and normal hits) also seduction needs a effect (floating hearts over the mobs head)
<br>
<br>more offensive abilities for the voidwalker, along with maybe a AE torment and a torment upgrade every 7 levels not 10
<br>
<br>instant cast fear, its to hard to get fear off vs fast hiting mobs especially if there more then 1
<br>
<br>make drain soul a DoT and when the mob dies you could make some effect that makes it look like the warlock sucked out the soul :)
<br>
<br>Curse of the Elements should lower the resist of the target not do a set amount more damage
<br>
<br>and finally just an overall curse upgrade, warlocks should be good at something why not make the the best debuffing class in the game<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Drolkrad ]<br></font></small>

								There has been alot of discussion in this forum about possible improvements to the Warlock class, but I have a few ideas:
<br>
<br>Spells
<br>
<br>1. Curses/DoT stacking!
<br>   This has been debated alot on the boards. However this is crucial to our class due to partying issues (You will HARDLY see a 5 warlock group...) A 5 warlock party should OWN. Even if 2 warlocks party, the only benefit is having 2 separate curses and an extra pet. The Blizz team should definitely consider letting at least our DoTs to stack. I can deal with curses not stacking.
<br>
<br>2. Increase DoT Damage/More DoT spells
<br>   When in a full party, by the time we cast ONE DoT or curse the monster is dead. The only time our DoTs are effective are on a Boss monster where DoT and debuffs help. Alot of my fellow warlocks have stated that we are the &quot;masters of DoT&quot;, but currently we are not. Also, we only have 2 DoT spells, Immolate and Corruption. How about another DoT that snares the mob? Or a DoT that causes ailments?
<br>
<br>3. Channeling spells that deplete when hit, rather than cancelling.  
<br>   Again, fellow warlocks have stated that channeling spells should not be cancelled when hit, but treated like spells. So, when casting a channel spell, the length of the spell is shortened per hit, not cancelled. This becomes a little aggravating when, for example, trying to get a soul shard off of a mob but he is attacking you. Impossible.
<br>
<br>4. Shadow Bolt Casting Time Shortened
<br>   I haven't seen this on the boards, but I feel our only direct damage spell shouldnt take forever to cast. I am not suggesting it be 2 seconds, since our DoTs should be doing some major hp draining (hint hint =)) but I hardly use this spell because it just takes too long to cast.
<br>
<br>Now on to pets. Fellow warlocks feel free to add what I missed :)
<br>
<br>Pets
<br>
<br>1. Tweak Voidwalkers Torment
<br>   Once aggro leaves our lovely Voidwalker, there is minimal chance of aggro going back to him. And if he does get aggro back, we are dead! 
<br>
<br>2. Tweak Succubus attack power
<br>   Blizz excellent job on her design IMO. But thats all she has...LOOKS! How about being able to upgrade her whip? Or maybe giving us a buff to up her attack power? Every lash of that whip should cause gruesome pain! Im not saying make her hit for 5000 hp, but bump her up a little ;)
<br>
<br>3. Revamp Imp
<br>   If we run out of soul shards, our only option is our Imp. Its really difficult to get a shard with him because...well..he's weak and cant take more than three hits. Maybe give him a spell that makes him morph into a HUGE imp for 10 seconds or something? It wouldn't increase is damage output, but maybe his HP so he could tank while we Drain Soul?
<br>
<br>4. &quot;Tweak Voidwalkers appearance&quot;
<br>   I have read around the forums of getting rid of his blue appearance and make him more &quot;demonic&quot; I agree he needs to look like he is from the pits of hell, dont u think? :)
<br>
<br>5. Ability to Equip Pet
<br>   As I mentioned earier, uprgrading Succubus' whip, upgrading Voidwalker's bracers, etc. 
<br>
<br>Team Spells
<br>
<br>1. Ritual of Summoning
<br>   Ritual of Summoning IMO should not use a soul shard. My reason behind this is due to the delicacy required to even use it. If a party member even sneezes, the portal disappears. Or, since it requires a soul shard, we shouldn't need two other people to cast it.
<br>
<br>2. Soulstones/Healthstones
<br>   I hate trading it to a party member! There should be another way to give it to a party member. If a priest is dying in the middle of a battle, and I want to save her life, she has to accept my trade? If there is another way around this let me know guys. How about an AOE spell to give it to team members during down time?
<br>
<br>Thats all I have for now at LVL 28. I may have some more later :-)
<br>
<br>P.S. Kat I read your reply about the &quot;Soul Bag&quot; I definitely like that idea. Its hard to keep track of our shards when it ends up in random bags. Also maybe allowing them to stack up to 2. If leaving it unable to stack, how about a nice 10-slot Soul Bag? :)<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Swizzel ]<br></font></small>

								<blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>Besides adding additional Warlock pets, what are your suggestions for improving this class?<hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>
<br>- Some kind of Instant Direct Damage spell, something powerful enough to be useful, but &quot;expensive&quot; enough to not be used routinely, like the stones [no one heals themselves with a healthstone outside of combat, for example].
<br>
<br>- Being able to loot pet kills. If the fact that we can't loot kills that are done by the pet is an oversight, please fix it. If it's a &quot;design decision&quot;, it's petty.
<br>
<br>- Fix The Imp. Give it some situational awareness. Doesn't bother me so much that he runs away, but that he runs away INTO new mobs. He should be able to detect where mobs are and run to a &quot;safer&quot; place, just like anyone else would sensibly do.
<br>
<br>- VW taunting and aggro ability able to keep up with the Warlocks ability to dish out damage. Every time we get an upgrade, we have to deal out dmg more gingerly.
<br>
<br>- Fighting with a Warlock is literally walking on eggs. One wrong move and we're done for, and there's no way to turn the tide besides Fear, such as, perhaps taunting twice with the VW. SOMETHING that we can use to get the mob turned back where it belongs. A little more margin of error would make the class a bit easier to play I think.
<br>
<br>- CoRecklessness pins the mob to its target.
<br>
<br>- ability to link consumables to the tool bar, to where the icon dims when the inventory item is missing rather than going away immediately (specific example being Healthstones, but it should work with potions etc. as well).
<br>
<br>- If you're doing a &quot;soul shard bag&quot;, please give it to use &quot;for free&quot;, and make it &quot;big enough&quot;, and if it's going to consume a bag slot, make it bigger than any bag we can normally get. Having to give up a bag slot for a 6 soul shard bag is NOT a good tradeoff. It has to be better than what we already have with bags as is.

<br>
<br>well, shoot. :( :(  other than that, welcome to the Warlock forum! Good to have you drop by! :P
<br>
<br>at any rate, Ultimus(?) has a MEGATON of information posted that has great value, from the correct perspective. 
<br>
<br>To improve our class, I summarize as follows:
<br>
<br>1)we already realize we aren't supreme single-target DPS. We are a damage-over-time class.
<br>
<br>2)We know we are a blend of HP and Mana. 
<br>
<br>3)We know we rely completely on pets when soloing.
<br>
<br>4)We know we are masters of choosing curses, this is our key. a smart warlock chooses the correct curse for the target.
<br>
<br>5)We know our one damage output, the Shadow Bolt, is underpowered *and* takes a darn long time to cast.
<br>
<br>OK, so these are just some brief summaries. To IMPROVE the class, without breaking the delicate balance, I think Warlocks should have their group aspect FURTHER enhanced, thus not giving them any dominating 1v1 tweak.
<br>
<br>My thoughts:
<br>
<br>1) Drastically upgraded AoE. We have to carry soul shards, give us an option to deploy them in an supremely high damage AoE, perhaps combined with a cost in Health (as suggested before) like Hellfire is. It just doesn't DO anything. :( We don't have any other single target high-damage spells, so we aren't encroaching on balance issue that I can see. And the best AoE title isn't claimed by any class, so it might as well be the Warlock.
<br>
<br>2) The pets. We know they're coming, and they are extremely important.
<br>
<br>3) Curses - IMHO, should be un-resistable. I'm ok with someone with a fire potion blocking Immolate, or someone with Shadow resist resisting a Shadow Bolt or Corruption. However, Curses are what we do. We manage curses by target, and some don't even DO DAMAGE (weakness / recklessness / tongues). Therefore, if priest has an insta-shield cast that is 100%, Mages get Nova root, Warlocks should have Curses that always land. I mean come on.
<br>
<br>4) I'm ok with our DPS, I understand how we do things. I'm content to let other people blast the hell out of a target while I sit comfortably not gathering aggro. HOWEVER, now that 'aggro' has been mentioned, we need to think about fear. Soloing a warlock is extremely difficult, as order of operations and TIMING are critical. One move too early and the target will come racing at you.... so... should Fear be insta-cast? I'm not saying un-resistable... just insta-cast. Thoughts? On the PvP server, the worst feeling is to get targetted by the enemy. We are the easist class to steamroll. Our pets can't help us, they won't take aggro off an actual player enemy. A tweak to fear could possibly help us out, and I don't think it would upset the balance too drastically.
<br>
<br>5)sensing skills EARLIER. I really needed detect invis at level 1.  hehehe ;) I want my whole map filled with sensed creatures. seeing a stealthed mage is cool when my HUD happens to be pointing in that direction, but I'd rather have them be LABELLED like in detect demons. This could be overpowering, though, so I'll step back a bit from this one. I just compare it to Paladins, who seem to be able to kill Undead from miles away. 
<br>
<br>6) Pets carrying stuff. I think our pets should be able to carry one bag. This way we don't have to worry about stacking. The VW is a big dude, he can handle it. Maybe the imp can't carry a bag or something, I dunno. but when I gear up for an instance, sometimes I'm screwed on the loot, cuz I gots' no room.  :(
<br>
<br>7) Give us a hint of talents. If we're still the bottom of the food chain, even to a class that isn't out, give me a sense of anticipation for something cool....  please? :(

								Suggested Improvements:
<br>
<br><ul>
<br><li> For being the KING of DOTS, we don't have many that aren't curses.  All you have is Immolate and Corruption.  It's almost always preferrable to use Weakness over any of the other curses, and since you can only have one at a time, it makes the others almost worthless except in a group.  Add a few more DOT options.  Like a scaling dot that doubles damage every tick... 1...2...4...8...16...32...64...128...256...512  More DOT options, for fast damage in groups or slow damage solo would really be nice.
<br>
<br><li> Give the Voidwalker some other ability besides taunt.  A minor group buff, or small Warlock only Damage shield (sort of like the Priest Holy Shield, but less absorbtion.  Maybe enough for 2 hits.
<br>
<br><li> The Voidwalker needs a little bit more speed in healing.  It was too fast originally, but is really slow now when out of combat.
<br>
<br><li> The AI on Torment needs some tweaks.  I will have a mob pounding on me, my pet will have torment ready and not cast it, I have to force it.
<br>
<br><li> Take one of the new DOTS (to be added) and make it cost a lot of mana, but damage very quickly.  Maybe like a &quot;Fading Torment&quot;  75..60..45..35..25..15..5  I would just like to see some creativity in the dots we get.
<br>
<br><li> The voidwalker is almost always used solo, but totally useless if you get jumped in PvP.  Some ability like a 2 sec stun recast every 15 would help give the warlock a fighting chance.  As it stands right now, 2 hits from a mage or 3 whacks from a warrior and I am out of commission.
<br>
<br><li> New Spell: <b>Sickening Empathy</b> Kind of like a cure disease (doesn't work on poisons, only disease type spells) except instead of removing the disease, it just transfers it to the warlock who then feels the effects for the remaining duration.  <b>Option:</b> Let the warlock take over Rez sickness this way.  So, a tank or healer can be rezed or soulstoned and the warlock be the one feeling the brunt of rez effects.  I think this would make us more valuable as group members with our soulstones.  If its setup so you can only have one of a specific disease on at a time, it keeps you from overdoing it with rezing and &quot;curing&quot; more than one person.  But, could help recover a Tank or Priest quickly if you are in a bad spot.
<br>
<br><li> When a voidwalker dies (may happen with other pets too) and he is resummoned, all of the debuffs applied to him remain.  Since he is a new pet, these should not be there.
<br>
<br><li> New Spell: <b>Reclaim Soul</b>   A warlock simply can't travel without a pet.  It's too dangerous because we are killed too easily.  Since pets disapear on bat rides, this is a real pain when it comes to soulshards and doing any kind of traveling.  Give us a spell to reclaim the soulstone used on a pet (unsummon it) but with a recast time of 30 or 60 minutes so it can't be abused.
<br>
<br><li> In PvP, by the time I can cast anything, besides one curse (maybe if I spot them first) I am dead.  Our spells take SO long to cast.  For example, a Mage hits me once, I cast tounges, then fear, by then the 2nd bolt hits me and I am dead.  Priests have insta cast spells and the shield.  No chance to compete.  Warriors and Rogues do major damage quickly and interrupt spells.  I am lucky to get anything other than a curse off (if you see them coming).  With the huge cast times while getting hit, nada.  Maybe an insta cast single target fear like the Priests AE fear.
<br>
<br><li> Make torment do something in PvP.  Remove me as a target, transfer target to my pet, anything, something.
<br>
<br><li> Option: Give Curse of weakness a small DOT with a long duration.  Like 200 damage over 1.5 minutes.  Adjusted for level.
<br>
<br>
<br></ul>
<br>
<br>Other (off the wall) suggestions:
<br>
<br><ul>
<br><li> Buff you can apply to a party member that will convert the hits they receive into a DOT.  So, if the person gets hit for 200 damage, instead of taking all the damage at once, it converts it to a dot that does 20 dmg every 5 secs.  A cap would need to be put on the damage converted like 200 or 300 based on level. This would be helpful to cast on healers or other casters.
<br>
<br><li> I would like to see the Voidwalker increase in size based on the player's level.  Smaller at level 10, then scale up in size as you level and cap at level 40 at about the size he is now, maybe a tad larger.   
<br>
<br><li> Give female characters an Incubus (male succubus) or give all characters the option to chose a male or female succubus.  The whole game doesn't have to be eye candy for boys.
<br>
<br><li> New Spell: <b>Suspended Death</b> Insta cast.  Kills the Warlock and his pet, but allows him to rez in place like he ran back to his corpse (with 50% HP and Mana, maybe even full health/mana).  During that time you are a ghost with the same restrictions of a ghost and can't move.  Maybe have a 5 min timer that sends you back to the graveyard like current death does.  This could be somewhat helpful in PvP ganking situations and some hopeless situations where a long run is the result.  To reduce impact, it would need a long recast time like 4 hours.
<br>
<br><li> New Spell / Ability: <b>Possession</b> Possess the targets body for XX secs.  15-20 secs maybe.  The Warlock takes control of the targets body, but can only move.  Can't cast spells, attack or anything else, just move.  During this time, the warlock in the possesseds body has the faction/hp of the character, so for instance, if they were a bear, other animals wouldn't attack.  After the spell wears off, the warlock is returned to his original location, but the mob is left where he ended.  You can even maintain agro and allow the possessed mob to agro nearby mobs just like he was pulled.  I think you might have to make the mob impervious during this time as well to prevent certain types of abuse.  During the possession, the warlocks body would appear translucent (like rogue sneak) so you can tell they are possessing something, but can't move and can't be attacked.  Almost like a ghost.

								I rerolled my level 45 Warlock this push to begin playing anew so I can further critique the changes to Warlock class. 
<br>
<br>In my opinion, the 1-10 tier of Warlock is perfect right now. Instant cast curses eliminated ALL the problems Warlock had in the first stages of the game. During the first 10 levels, the Warlock is FORCED to tank. There is no other option. Thus, instant cast curses play a big roll in this. A Warlock can get off two dots and then use instant cast Curse of Weakness and he'll tank just as good as a warrior for the early levels. 
<br>
<br>At lower levels, the imp damage is fairly decent and the nerfs to him this push do not effect him. However, his AI NEEDS to be changed back to how it originally was. Even at lower levels when I am the one tanking, the imp will run around like a two-year-old trying to play WoW. As an illustration, I noticed if a mob just CROSSES the imps path (meaning runs over him) the imp has the probability of becoming &quot;feared.&quot; This issue needs to be addressed and I am hoping it will be modified to some extent. The imp should not run when he is not aggro. 
<br>
<br>Another issue I found with the imp is the inability to stop him once he has begun casting a spell. Once I hit CTRL-1 the imp will begin casting his spell; however, if I push CTRL-2 he will not interrupt his casting. This is very annoying and I suggest others /suggest this as well. 
<br>
<br>Finally, I noticed the imp is not critical hitting this push. I heard he did last push with a VERY low probability. His critical hitting needs to be increased. The Succubus and the Voidwalker (which is a non-damage pet) both have critical hit. The imp's critical hit rate should be increased to approximately the same as the other two pets. This would be a nice compensation to his damage nerf this push. (Which nearly halved his DPS) 
<br>
<br>At lower levels, the Voidwalker is fine. I am able to nail a mob with 3 dots and then use shadow bolt and I will not gain aggro. However, when I was 45, one immolate would be enough for the Voidwalker to lose aggro and the mob would stick to me like glue. Additionally, I noticed when I obtained my Voidwalker this push the Voidwalker I fought in the summoning circle used a &quot;rage&quot; type of spell. It increased his attack speed and damage temporarily. I am going to assume this was a spell originally planned for the Voidwalker but later removed. (Similar to how NPC mages still cast Chains of Ice). 
<br>
<br>The Voidwalker at lower levels is how it should also tank at higher levels. However, the problem is his damage does not scale to match the Warlock's DPS at higher levels and Torment at higher levels is not adequate enough. My suggestion would be to give the Voidwalker the Rage spell that the NPC Voidwalker casts. 
<br>
<br>The Rage spell should be slightly tweaked to help fulfill the Voidwalker's role as a tank. It should hasten his attack speed but also give him an aggro buff that will cause him to generate even more aggro. The spell should have a 1-2 minute recast timer and only last as long as 5-10 seconds. 
<br>
<br>You will ask, how will this help the Voidwalker at higher levels? The problem with the Voidwalker at higher levels is for it to be an adequate tank the Warlock must allow the Voidwalker time to generate aggro on a mob. This means the Warlock will basically lower his DPS by a substantial amount. Giving this spell to the Voidwalker will allow the Voidwalker to generate enough hate to obtain initial aggro on a mob. This will allow the Warlock to be able to freely dot the mob with immolate, corruption, and the curse of your choice. Additionally, the Warlock should be able to throw a bolt following those attacks and not over aggro the Voidwalker. From this point on, the mob should be at least half health or less so the Warlock can sit back and bolt the final ounces of the mob's life away. 
<br>
<br>The most obvious benefit of implementing this rage spell for the Voidwalker is the fact it is already there. The spell itself would just need some minor tweaking for the aggro suggestion I have proposed. 
<br>
<br>This is just the first part of my Warlock critique. I'll do another write up soon (11-20). It will include the effectiveness of the Imp and the downfall of the Voidwalker. (Meaning I am going to compare it each level at how its effectiveness declines). There will also be more. 
<br>
<br><b>11-28</b>
<br>
<br>This is when the downfall of the Warlock begins is in these early levels. The Voidwalker holds outstanding aggro in the teens until the Warlock obtains his new Corruption upgrade. Once I got this upgrade I noticed a decrease in the performance of the Voidwalker. However, it is still quite viable to use him as a tank in the teens. A Warlock must use manual taunt (meaning don't wait for autocast it is too slow) to keep aggro on the Voidwalker. I was able to shoot 3-4 Shadowbolts in order to generate enough aggro for the Voidwalker to loose it. 
<br>
<br>Additionally, in the teens is when the Warlock will notice the aggro from Lifetap. Once you get that next upgrade you will notice you generate some mean aggro when you are fighting more then one mob. This was suppose to be corrected this patch but it wasn't. I expect this fixed in the future. 
<br>
<br>Lifedrain in the lower levels is fairly useless in my opinion. The rate at which it heals a low level Warlock is nothing compared to what consuming food at that level would do for you. My suggestion here is to get rid of Lifedrain until the 20's. It just isn't needed because the Voidwalker is still a pretty viable aggro generator at this point. I would like to see a compensation though and moving a few of our dot upgrades to a lower requirement. For instance, getting an upgrade to Curse of Agony (DOT) might entice Warlocks to use it more often. Right now upgrades for this spell come really slow. 
<br>
<br>Furthermore, I want to see more Shadowbolt upgrades more often. I am not stating they should do more damage but we should get a Shadowbolt upgrade about the same rate as Mage's get a Frostbolt upgrade. Sometimes it is painful waiting for that next Shadowbolt upgrade. (IE 27-28). 
<br>
<br>The main problem with 11-28 is our spell upgrades are too spread out. I feel as if we always get that &quot;big&quot; level where our power just shoots up. Hopefully Blizzard spreads our upgrades out a little over the levels. 
<br>
<br>Level 20 is when the Warlock gets the Succubus. Great job Blizzard, you have made her ESPECIALLY good at her job! Sucking! Yes the Succubus this push is crap. At the lower levels I NEVER use her. If I am not going to use the Voidwalker I am going to use the Imp for a good fear kite. Her DPS needs to be improved. 
<br>
<br>The Imp holds fairly strong throughout 11-28 but I feel he needs some more Firebolt upgrades. His damage does not scale as a Warlock levels up, thus, once again a Warlock is waiting for that next level when he gets a ton of new spells/upgrades. The Imp works MUCH better in open areas (Like Shimmering Flats) for fear kiting compared to using a Voidwalker. Moreover, I found a really good strat using the Imp is to Weakness a fast hitting mob (Usually a Lion type mob). They will do approximately 5 damage to you per hit and be killing themselves on your damage shield from the Imp. I burned through Hillsbrad doing this. 
<br>
<br>The late 20's is when the Voidwalker starts having the Succubus syndrome. His aggro generation decreases as the Warlock gets more upgrades. He needs more abilities (To make him more &quot;fun&quot;) and a better taunt starting around 22. Right now I am in the Shimmering Flats and he cannot hold aggro at all. If I dot a mob with all three of our dots he will loose aggro after approximately 10 seconds. I have used him so much this push I have memorized when he will loose/gain aggro. 
<br>
<br>I do not have the game mechanics laying in front of me but I have run several tests with Torment. If I immolate a mob and send the Voidwalker in and he casts Torment the mob will be on him. If I immolate a mob and the mob hits me the Voidwalker has to do 2 Torments to get it off of me. I never really understood this but I think it is a flaw in the aggro mechanics of the game. Has anyone else noticed this? It is not just Torment either. If I have the Imp, I can cast agony on a mob and he casts a fireball he now has aggro. Same scenario, if the mob reaches me he will have to cast approximately two fireballs to get it off of me. 
<br>
<br>Ultimately, I think Demon Armor/Skin line needs to have a slight change. Demon Armor/Skin's NON-combat regeneration should be buffed significantly. I feel we are the least travel friendly class. It is a pain trying to run through heavily populated zones with aggro mobs. Mages have frost shield which slows mobs, rogues have sprint, paladins have heals, priests have heals, druids have heals/cat form, shamans have heals/wolf form, and warriors have defensive and or instant cast snare. Why is it we do not have any travel friendly spells at lower levels? 
<br>
<br>I think that if Blizzard buffed the non-combat regeneration of our shield line this would greatly help us. We could run through a field of monsters get slammed a bunch and then come out regenerating and not having to stop and eat. Perhaps as a slight balance issue using Lifetap would cause you to temporarily go into attack mode (Where the * appears). 
<br>
<br>Well, this is some thoughts of mine so far and what I have been telling Blizzard. Sorry if it seems jumbled but this is the way it appears in my notes. :)<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Ultimus ]<br></font></small>

<br>
<br>The Voidwalker suffers from a tremendous mana problem once he gets his new Torment at level 30. In fact, when I chain fighting in Arathi in my early 30's I would have downtime due to him running out of mana. Moreover, I was also having downtime at some points when the Voidwalker would become low on health. 
<br>
<br>Health Funnel needs to be buffed in the lower levels of the game. I noticed I would have much longer downtimes with the Voidwalker until I got the new health funnel in the 30's. This new funnel is a massive upgrade over the other ones. I could heal the Voidwalker past half health with just one casting. 
<br>
<br>At level 28 I acquired Banish and I did not talk much about it in my previous post due to me making posts about it in this forum. In my opinion, Banish should be reworked altogether. When I was fighting elementals in Arathi, I acquired a charm that would banish an elemental there. I hadn't used it in previous pushes but since I was farming elementals for their regeants I figured it'd be handy to keep this time. When I used I expected it to function similar to our banish... instead it instantly kills an elemental and leaves you with no experience or body to loot. 
<br>
<br>Our Banish should function similar to this. Banish is a shadow of other forms of crowd control. It costs a soulshard, has a very long cooldown, random duration, and is resistable. I propose Banish instantly kills a mob within a certain level range (IE no more then 5 levels above you) and only able to kill &quot;minions.&quot; Minions I classify as trash mobs and not a true boss mob or named. Furthermore, when a mob is banished and instantly killed it yields no experience and no corpse. This is due to the fact when a Warlock Banishes a mob he is sent to the Twisting Nether unable to ever return to our world. To prevent griefing, do not allow Banish on mobs that not tapped by you or your group. 
<br>
<br>Voidwalker is still holding aggro shakey but I am also having another concern. He is starting to tank worse and worse. I suggest taking his DPS away from him. Put his DPS back to 5-4 damage per hit. I'd like to even add a damage shield to the Voidwalker. He would hold aggro through an improved torment and his damage shield. Thus, the more mobs he is tanking the more damage he would do. 
<br>
<br>Right now the Voidwalker can barely tank two mobs. I was fighting elite ogres in Stranglethorn Vale and he would last no more then 10 seconds versus one of these ogres. Luckily, we employed the help of some friends to take down the named Ogre for the Mind's Eye quest. 
<br>
<br>I would also like to see the Voidwalker made more group friendly. I propose giving him a shield ability that will allow him to absorb some damage from a friendly ally. For instance, the Voidwalker could use this shield to absorb 25% of a target's damage and that damage is then returned back onto himself. 
<br>
<br>The Imp probably has the highest DPS coupled with Curse of Elements out of all the pets right now. He still suffers from his stupid AI which is a pain in the neck. I even noticed the NPC Imps share this same fate. It is hillarious watching an NPC Warlock and his Imp be engaged in battle. I send my Voidwalker on his Imp and the Imp runs around like a chicken with its head cut off. 
<br>
<br>Get rid of this pet AI for the Imp. There is no skill involved in having extraneous values outside of the Warlock's control. 
<br>
<br>I would like to see the Imp's DPS buffed again. If he had a damage over time dot, similar to Mage's fireball, that would be great. This dot would be much more potent then a Mage's dot and could increase his DPS tremendously. 
<br>
<br>Curse of Elements is probably one of our worst curses in the Warlock line. It should also be revamped. Curse of Elements should do two things: 
<br>
<br>1) Curse of Elements should lower the target's resists by a factor of X. (Where I am not sure by how much but you get the picture) 
<br>
<br>2) It should increase secondary effects of the said elements. For instance, the secondary effect of an ice spell is the slow duration. Curse of Elements would slightly increase the slow effect and the duration. Another example would be the mage's fireball dot, it would increase the damage of the dot and the length. 
<br>
<br>Curse of Elements would not be limited to the spells I listed. It could also increase the secondary effect of Frost Nova. It could lower the percentage of breaking when damage occurs and slightly increase the duration by one second. 
<br>
<br>Finally, curse of elements could do something very special to the Warlock's immolation. It would make the burn effect do more damage AND burn any targets near the immolated targeted. This could be neat when AEing mobs and it would increase the DPS output of immolation. 
<br>
<br>Succubus still sucks and I hardly ever use her this push. Her mez is great though the graphics need to be reworked. It is hard for a groupmate to recognize her mez. Lash of Pain needs a damage increase. Maybe add a bleeding effect where the victim takes damage over time. Ultimately, the Succubus needs a melee DPS damage increase. It was overnerfed. 
<br>
<br>Hellfire is one of the best AE spells in the game. Imo, it should be the most damaging AE spell in the game. I propose changing the way the spell works. Make the AE take MORE of the Warlock's hp but have an INFINITE duration. The HP cost would be significantly increased and so would the damage. This could create some interesting strategies -- Keep the Warlock alive and he creates serious DPS. 
<br>
<br>Drain Life scales pretty nicely throughout the Warlock's career and this is one of our more polished spells in my opinion. It still suffers from the lack of channeling creativity though. 
<br>
<br>The Nightmare compared to last push is AWESOME. The speed increase is very nice and not loosing it on hit is great. This is definitely one of the Warlock's strongest points. I hope to see talents that will increase the speed of the Nightmare. In my opinion, the Nightmare WITH talents should be the fastest mount in the game. 
<br>
<br>Shadowbolt seems to become less and less effective the higher I go. It is no where near the DPS of a Mage's fireball but the difference is astonishing. Personally, Shadowbolt should be buffed slightly or give all our dots an initial DD factor similar to immolation. In fact, giving a DD factor to Curse of Agony may draw more Warlocks to it. Of course a short cooldown time would be added since it is an instant cast spell. 
<br>
<br>40-50 is now the ultimate downfall of the Warlock. We get no pet upgrades past 38 (With the exception of the Voidwalker at 40). Thus, our DPS is going to go down from here.

<br>Blizz excellent job on her design IMO. But thats all she has...LOOKS! How about being able to upgrade her whip? Or maybe giving us a buff to up her attack power? Every lash of that whip should cause gruesome pain! Im not saying make her hit for 5000 hp, but bump her up a little ;) <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>-- Add a DOT to the whip.  Like Bleed.

<br>Once aggro leaves our lovely Voidwalker, there is minimal chance of aggro going back to him. And if he does get aggro back, we are dead! <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>-- So true.  Even when not hitting or casting more spells, the pet just can't get it back.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br> 4. &quot;Tweak Voidwalkers appearance&quot;

<br>-- Good suggestion on the graphics.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br> 1. Ritual of Summoning 
<br>Ritual of Summoning IMO should not use a soul shard. My reason behind this is due to the delicacy required to even use it. If a party member even sneezes, the portal disappears. Or, since it requires a soul shard, we shouldn't need two other people to cast it. <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>-- Agreed.  Another option might be to make it cost 3 soulshards but no other people required.  Or 2 soulshards and just one person which would eliminate the summoning problems.
<br><blockquote><small><hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"><small class="white">Q u o t e:</small><br>Some kind of Instant Direct Damage spell, something powerful enough to be useful, but &quot;expensive&quot; enough to not be used routinely, like the stones [no one heals themselves with a healthstone outside of combat, for example]. <hr noshade color="#9E9E9E" size="1"></small></blockquote>
<br>-- Maybe even summon a death stone.  It does 25% HP damage to the mob, but costs a soulshard to create and not be tradeable.  Make the recast like 5 mins.

								<b>Curse Combinations</b>
<br>
<br>I love the aspect of curses for the Warlock class. I feel this should be the main reason for a group to add a Warlock to the party. For example, groups add priests for their healing, warriors for tankage, and mages for damage. 
<br>
<br>My idea is a combination system for the Warlock and his curses. Curses will now create a combo effect when stacked with dots and other curses. 
<br>
<br>NOTE: Every combination requires Corruption and Immolation and one curse or more. 
<br>
<br>Examples of combinations: 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Agony = Added effect of all dots now tick much faster then before. 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Weakness = Mobs now take damage based on the damage they lost from weakness and acts as a damage shield. For example, if the weakness decreased the mob's attack damage by 10 everytime the mob attacked a person it would take 10 additional damage. 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Tongues = An added dot is placed on the mob that depletes his or her mana. This dot will deal damage to the mob's mana every tick as long as tongues is in effect. 
<br>
<br>These combinations could be very fun and give us even more strategy when planning out battles. Additionally, I want combinations to solve the problem of multiple Warlocks in a group. Personally, I feel that there is no reason to add more then one Warlock to a group outside of acquiring an extra curse and a new pet. (Some other classes suffer from this as well) My idea is with combinations Warlocks could create &quot;super combos&quot; with other Warlocks in the same group. 
<br>
<br>As an illustration: 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Agony + Weakness = Added effect of dots tick faster, mob takes damage equal to that subtracted from weakness, AND a third effect of any person attacking the mob with a melee weapon will gain 10 health on each successful blow. 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Weakness + Tongues = Added effect of a mana dot, damage shield, AND a third new effect of all spells casted by the mob has its damage reduced by a percentage equal to that of Weakness. For instance, if weakness lowered the mobs attack by 16 his spells would be lowered by 16%. 
<br>
<br>These super combos could get more powerful as more Warlocks are added to the group. 
<br>
<br>For instance: 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Weakness + Tongues + Agony = Mana dot, damage shield, dots tick faster, lifesteal, spells reduced by percentage equal to weakness, AND a new effect of all damage depletes both the opponent's MANA and HP. For example, a 100 damage blow would lower the opponent's hitpoints by 100 and his mana by 100. 
<br>
<br>These combinations would make Warlocks very class defined. They would also encourage adopting multiple Warlocks into a group. Moreover, it would allow us to plan strategical attacks with other Warlocks and or ourselves. The ideas listed above are just drawing board ideas to try and illustrate my point. Some of them might seem overpowered in this stage but I needed to create something to use as an example. 
<br>
<br>Edit: More combination examples 
<br>
<br>Corruption + Immolation + Curse of Elements = Added effect of reducing target's spell damage by the amount the Element increasing damage by. For instance, if elements increased damage by 20 the opponent's spell damage would be decreased by 20. NOTE: Does not apply to Shadow damage<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Ultimus ]<br></font></small>

								<b>Voidwalker</b>
<br>
<br>Voidwalker should have his mana pool replaced and be given a rage pool similar to Warriors. It is VERY annoying when you get the higher up taunt upgrades and he becomes ALWAYS out of mana due to chain casting taunt. He already cannot hold aggro and then if you start chain fighting he cannot even cast Torment. 
<br>
<br>If the Voidwalker was given a rage pool, I would suggest adding an ability that generates rage over a small amount of time. (Think of the Warrior's spell that turns hp into rage) This would allow the Voidwalker to be able to use a Taunt right off the start. 
<br>
<br>Another issue is nets. Lower level players will probably not encounter this but higher ones will. When an NPC casts a net on the Voidwalker, the NPC will almost ALWAYS switch aggro from the Voidwalker to you. My solution is to add a new spell to the Warlock line. This spell will cure his or her pet of any status effect. The spell will be instant cast but will cost a portion of the Warlock's life in terms of percentages. I am thinking somewhere between 5%-10% health.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Ultimus ]<br></font></small>

								<b>Eye Candy Warlock Requests</b>
<br>
<br>We may have some important issues besides eye candy but I want to speak about some aspects I want to be more visually satisfying. 
<br>
<br>The Voidwalker needs a new model in my opinion. I picture the Voidwalker resembling a Shade from Warcraft III then a big blue blob. I once even had a guy ask me why do Warlock's get water elementals. (He was referring to the Voidwalker). 
<br>
<br>The new Voidwalker model should be more smokey in appearance and transparent. It would be a mist that is hard to see and hard to hit. (Hence this could coincide with why he would tank so well) 
<br>
<br>Another eye candy visual I'd like see added is some cool graphics to drain soul. When I kill a mob with drain soul, I do not feel like I just stole its soul. I want to see two things happen: 
<br>
<br>1) I want a ghastly wail when the target dies after stealing his soul. Think of the wail the banshee makes as an example. 
<br>
<br>2) When you steal something's soul, it should be similar to Soulreaver: Legacy of Kain. For those unaware of what I am referring too, when you captured someone's soul in that game a blue transparent copy of the mob appeared and went inside of you. The same could be applied to WoW. When you kill a mob via draining their soul, a blue transparent image of the mob could rise from the body and quickly shrink into the palm of your hand. 
<br>
<br>These are just some visuals I'd like to see added down the road to make the Warlock class feel even &quot;cooler.&quot;

								<b>Mana Drain</b>
<br>
<br>Personally, I think this spell has VERY limited use. For instance, if I am facing an enemy caster I will more then likely proceed to Curse of Tongues and then nuke them down to their low hitpoints. I will not attempt to drain their mana before attacking. 
<br>
<br>Additionally, if I am in a group with elite mobs, I still find it has little use. It is handy very Paladin type mobs since they have small pools. (Which is great to stop Turn Undead) Versus Priest type mobs, I feel it is about 50/50 with its usefulness. Sometimes their mana pools are just so large it would be more beneficial to nuke then to attempt to drain. 
<br>
<br>Finally, I have noticed this push Mana Drain BREAKS Polymorph. The spell causes no damage, why does it do this now? You use to be able to drain sleeping mobs. 
<br>
<br>My solution for this spell: 
<br>
<br>Make it cost a Soulshard, make it SIGNIFICANTLY steal an enemy's mana (think WC 3 Bloodmage) and SIGNIFICANTLY replenish the Warlock's mana. It should also have a short cooldown time (1-3 minutes). Warlocks are suppose to be anti-casters. It is in our job description. I feel if this spell was changed in this direction it would provide both an emergency mana battery and or take out a caster in battle.<p><small><font color="red">[ post edited by Ultimus ]<br></font></small>

								<b>Pet Snacks</b>
<br>
<br>Anyone else really dislike the downtime that comes into play when using a mega-hp pet like the Voidwalker? If you do, I came across this idea that might be a viable solution. 
<br>
<br>What if Warlocks (And Hunters when implemented) could buy a food item that heals a pet? It would work the same as a food item for a PC. A person would use it and their pet must be out of combat. Additionally, when a pet is eating he would be in &quot;Guard Here&quot; mode, meaning he could not move. If he is hit, it would cancel the effect. The pet would regenerate his hitpoints faster then normal when using a &quot;Pet Snack.&quot; This could also be part of the cooking skill tree and would add more recipes to this trade skill. 
<br>
<br>Pet snacks would be upgraded similar to how food is upgraded every few levels. Pet snacks should cost smaller amount then regular food (Perhaps half the cost). 
<br>
<br>Thoughts? Comments? If you don't like the idea, what would you suggest for reducing pet downtime? 
<br>
<br>And to play with the idea even more, there could even be snacks with little benefits. For example, perhaps a certain snack from the cooking tradeskill would give the pet temporary attack boost or armor boost.

								<b>Undead Succubus Quest</b>
<br>
<br>Last push an Undead Warlock was sent to Wetlands to kill an NPC there and collect his heart. The NPC you are suppose to kill is level 20 and has a level 25 bodyguard. This is the same this push but with a twist. Both of these NPCs have a faction tag so when the Warlock attacks one of them he is tagged +PVP. Thankfully, I did this quest at very late night and only got PKed once attempting to do it. (Note I am on the PVE server) 
<br>
<br>In my opinion, faction should be removed from these mobs for the Warlock quest. A player should not be forced into PVP like this. In fact, if a player attempts this quest during prime time I am sure he will be griefed if the Alliance are aware he is attempting to do a quest that involves PVP NPCs. 
<br>
<br>I /suggested this in game.

								<b>Imp Critical Hits</b>
<br>
<br>The Voidwalker and Succubus both have the chance to deal a critical hit when they attack an opponent. Additionally, the Succubus can deal a critical during her Lash of Pain special attack. I have noticed the Imp is unable to perform a critical hit with his Firebolt spell. Casters are able to critical when they cast spells and the other pets can critical, so why not the Imp? 
<br>
<br>I did a /feedback on this today. I have been playing Warlock for quite a while and this never dawned on me until today sadly. I haven't seen this talked about anywhere else so I thought I'd bring it to everyone's attention and get their thoughts on it. 
<br>
<br>Giving the Imp critical hits would be a nice compensation for their damage being halved. Perhaps this could be an addition for next push.

<br>Perhaps one method to improve our DPS would give dots a chance to deal double damage each tick. For instance, a dot that ticks for 30 damage each tick has a 10% chance of dealing a 60 damage each tick.

<br>The critical tick rate of dots would be much higher then that of normal spells.

								<b>DOTs NEED to stack</b>
<br>
<br>As I am sure many Warlocks are aware of, our dots do not stack with other Warlocks dots. This means two Warlocks cannot stack a spell together like corruption. This clearly detracts from our appeal to groups and in raiding situations. As an illustration, would you take a group of a Warrior, Priest, Warlock, Mage, Mage, or a group of Warrior, Priest, Warlock, Warlock, Mage? Having two mages would be the added benefit of CC and more fast damage. On the other hand, having an extra Warlock would bring about one extra pet and an extra curse on a mob. 
<br>
<br>This issue also effects raiding situations. I am a previous Everquest gamer and was one of the top ranked Warriors world wide. My second class of choice (My twink) was a Necromancer and they functioned very similar to Warlocks. The Necromancers dots were not stackable with other Necromancers. This made them VERY useless on raids when compared to other classes. Finally, SOE confined to the masses and allowed dots to stack. 
<br>
<br>I am trying to warn all the Warlocks now to help address this issue. You will soon find out when raids of 50+ people are implemented how useless you will become when paired with 9 other Warlocks.
