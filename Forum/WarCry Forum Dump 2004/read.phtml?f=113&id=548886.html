If you start as a Dwarf or Gnome, do post 2 of the dwarven areas then head to the human areas and follow post 1.<br/>
<br/>
This is a guide posted by my brother who is the mod over at the Penny Arcade WoW forums. I thought I'd steal it and post it here for everyone's benefit.<br/>
<br/>
So you make your character, and wisely select Human because, let's face it, they're the only real choice. The Horde is just ... fugly. And once you go over to the Alliance, some of the choices aren't much better. Let's face it - running around at crotch height for the next few years, getting kicked around by peons, and having everybody make fun of your hygene for the next few years is NOT the way to go. Any race under five feet tall is automatically out. And, since I'm going to assume you don't want your character to have handlebars for ears, the fruity elves aren't much better. Besides, the male night elves have forearms of frightening proportions. I prefer not to think about their ... personal habits.<br/>
<br/>
Human it is. So you pop up in Northshire Valley, right next to Deputy Wilhelm. He's gonna give you a quest to go talk to Marshal McBride, which you'll take. Turn around, walk into the Abbey, and you'll see Marshal McBride. Turn in the quest from Wilhelm, get the quest from McBride (Kobold Camp Cleanup - Kill 10 kobold vermin), and head on out of the Abbey. Immediately hook a right and follow the walls of the abbey around, and you'll see Eagan Peltskinner. He'll give you a quest (Wolves Across the Border) to gather 8 Tough Wolf Meats. Turn around and start killing - the kobolds and wolves are right on the west/northwest side of the abbey, in plain view of where you should be standing now.<br/>
<br/>
Complete both quests. Go turn them in, and get the new quests McBride has for you. At this point you should hit level 2, and have two things to do - get your class quest from Marshal McBride, which will require you to speak with your trainer, and you can now buy new spells. Luckily, both take you to the same place, so head over to your trainer (inside or next to the abbey, depending on class), turn in your letter of introduction to your trainer, and get your level 2 spells.<br/>
<br/>
Your next quest you should have gotten when you turned in Kobold Camp Cleanup... Investigate Echo Ridge. This one requires that you kill 10 Kobold Workers. They're in about the same place as the Vermin, but if workers aren't plentiful near the Vermin, there should be some around the entrance to the mine to the northwest. Kill your Workers, go turn in the quest, and get the final step - Skirmish at Echo Ridge. This one requires you to kill 15 Kobold Laborers, which are all inside the mine to the Northwest. Leg it over there, and knock 'em down. One quick note - if anybody is doing the same quests as you, group up with them. The entire Kobold line is straight kill quests - everyone in the group gets credit for any kills anybody in the group makes. Three or four people can tear through the kobolds in nothing flat. After turning it in, you'll get a quest to Report to Goldshire, which you won't do until you've solved a little bandit problem.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it's time to work on the Defias. Wilhelm should have an exclamation mark above his head - go get his quest (Brotherhood of Thieves). He wants you to collect some Red Burlap Bandanas. These quests aren't as good to do in groups - you have to each collect 12 bandanas. (Kill quests are great for groups, collection quests are no better in groups than solo. But it never hurts to have a partner or two to work with - you get group xp bonuses, and kill quicker.) So go kill yourself some Defias.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've got all the damn bandanas (and don't worry, you'll be collecting bandanas from Defias again... and again... and again...just wait and see!) then go turn it in to Wilhelm. He should then present you with two quests, Milly Osworth and Bounty on Garrick Padfoot. Milly Osworth requires that you speak to Milly along the eastern side of the Abbey - go talk to her and she'll give you a quest, Milly's Harvest. That sends you into the Defias field you were just at (would have been nice if he'd clued you in before you went to collect the bandanas, eh? Yeah, you'll get that a lot too.) to collect 8 crates of grapes from barrels spread about the field. Right-click on the barrels to get the grapes. After that, go just northeast of the field to a little shack where Garrick Padfoot is. At this point he should be a pushover, even with a few guards. If necessary, grab a passer-by to group up, but it shouldn't be necessary, unless you're a sissy.<br/>
<br/>
Go turn in the grapes, then turn in Garrick's head. Milly will have given you another quest to give the Grape Manifest to somebody inside the abbey - go in the main room, head up the stairs, and turn it into the friar up top. Now, you should be done with Northshire Valley.<br/>
<br/>
From here you head southwest into Goldshire. On the way, pick up Rest and Relaxation from some geek just outside Northshire Abbey. Go down to Goldshire and turn both in, and start picking up quests. Remy Two-Times will have a quest for you (Gold Dust Exchange), Marshal Dughan will have one (The Fargodeep Mine), and inside the inn, Wiliam Pestle will have a quest (Kobold Candles). After grabbing these, head south to the Stonefield farm. Get the Lost Necklace quest, and head east, around the Kobold mine, to the Maclure farm. There, talk to Billy for the next step in the Lost Necklace quest... which requires you to kill some boars. Grab Young Lovers from the barn on the east side of the field (From Maybell Maclure) and start killing Boars, to satisfy the requirements for Pie for Billy. Once you have your four boar meat, turn them in at Auntie Berniece Stonefield, go back to Billy and give him the pie, and you'll have the final step - which requires that you go into the Fargodeep Mine and kill Goldtooth, a named kobold, for the necklace.<br/>
<br/>
So now you need to explore the mine (The Fargodeep Mine), kill kobolds for gold dust (Gold Dust Exchange) as well as for candles (Kobold Candles), and kill the named kobold for a necklace (Goldtooth.) Get busy.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've killed a veritable army of kobolds, and have your necklace, your candles, your gold dust, and your credit for exploring the mines, head back to the Stonefield farm and turn it in. If you didn't previously pick up Princess Must Die! from Ma Stonefield, do so now. Then head west to the river, and maybe a little south, and you should find Billy Joe Stonefield, or whatever the hell the damn okie calls himself. Give him the lovey-dovey letter, get his quest, and then go back and talk to Gramma Stonefield. Yes, the old biddy is sticking her nose in this too. She'll send you to William Pestle, who you have to turn in the candles to anyways. Head up to Goldshire, turn in the gold dust, and get A Fishy Peril. Go over to Marshal Dughan, and turn in Fishy Peril and The Fargodeep Mine. Get Further Concerns (follows Fishy Peril) and The Jasperlode Mine (if you can't figure out what this follows, go play Shadowbane.) Go inside the inn, turn in the candles, turn in the next step in the sappy "help out the bimbo who can't see her boyfriend" quest (get the next step, Collecting Kelp), and, if you haven't talked to the innkeeper to bind your Hearthstone here, do so. It can periodically save you a walk. Like right now. You should have gotten a quest to deliver a 'Shipment to Stormwind' as well. Stormwind is to the northwest, follow the road and you can't miss it. Their shop is the second, I believe, on the left, once you get into town. Then heartstone back. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/smileys/Yellow/smile.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="=)" alt="=)"><br/>
<br/>
Now you're supposed to collect some Crystal Kelp Fronds. Kobolds in the lake to the east drop them. They're mainly clustered on two islands on the eastern end, but kill whichever fishy bastards come your way. And kill a few extras, because Murlocs suck, and need to die. By the thousands. They're kinda like water-gnomes, as far as I'm concerned.<br/>
<br/>
While you're out here, jog a little northeast into the Jasperlode Mine. You can try and be ballsy and blitz in until you get credit, or slowly clear your way in. Whatever way works for you, I'm a squishy priest so I tend to clear my way, if I don't have a hairbrained friend I can get to charge in leading the way. After you get credit, head back to Goldshire, turn in the fronds and the mine exploration quest, and head back to the Maclure farm. Give the bimbo her drink, let her run off with her boy-toy, and head northeast along the road to the guard station.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get there, talk to the guards at the bridge. Turning in 'Further Concerns' gets you 'The Lost Guards'. Turns out a pair of guards went off to the north and haven't returned. I smell murlocs, evil bastards. You can also get a quest to 'Protect the Frontier' and kill some Prowlers and Young Forest Bears. Prowlers are predominantly on the east side of the river, just south of the road, and Young Forest Bears are scattered about all the way back to the Stonefield farm. For now, worry about the guards - head north along the river until you see some ... carnage, lying on the ground. It looks like something carniverous left its raw meat behind, and there might be part of a rib left there as well. And, you guessed it, that's one of the guards. Damn water-gnomes. Search the corpse (and we're using that word loosely, 'smallish steak' is a more apt description of whats left) and head east. The other guard went and died in the middle of a damn murloc army, as luck would have it.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's on the southwest side of the camp. It used to be in the center, and it was a damn bitch back then, you kids have your questing so easy now-a-days. So search his remains, get the medallion or whatever, and head south, staying on the east side of the river. You'll eventually run into the Eastvale Logging Camp, which will have a few quests of its own. While you're wandering around, kill any Prowlers or Young Forest Bears. The quests in Eastvale require you to do two things... haul lumber ('Look, ma, I'm a peon!' 'Aw, I'm so proud of you, son, now go die to an orc grunt.') and collect more bandanas, this time from the Defias to the southwest, across the river, at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch. (The ones near Jerod's Landing, south-southeast of Goldshire, work as well, but they're a lot farther away.) (HA! I told you you'd be collecting more Bandanas. Don't worry, you'll be doing it again in Westfall, and in the Stockades, and in... yeah, you get the idea.) Do both of those quests, and while you're down at the Pumpkin Patch, kill that fat-ass pig Princess and make me a BLT. It's the least you could do.<br/>
<br/>
If, at this point, you haven't completed Protecting the Frontier, kill the remaining critters, and turn that one in as well. Then run back to the Goldshire area and turn in any quests that need turning in. Now, Dughan might have a quest for you - Westbrook Garrison Needs Help or something. Head west to the Garrison (just north of the road, almost to the Westfall border), and get the next step. You should receive "Riverpaw Gnoll Bounty" which requires you to collect 8 Painted Gnoll Armbands. There is also a Wanted poster outside the garrison. Click on it and get 'Wanted: Hogger.' This one requires you to kill a level 11 named gnoll. Gather anybody near (somebody is always shouting that they need to kill him. If not, it's your turn to shout) and go kill gnolls. The staff you get from killing Hogger is great for quite awhile for any caster class - do your best to make sure you get it before you head up to dwarven lands.<br/>
<br/>
You have one last task while in Elwynn Forest. Swing by the armory in Goldshire, if you haven't already, and pick up Elmore's Task. It'll send you to the Dwarven District in Stormwind (in the northeast corner), and you'll talk to Grimand Elmore (at the northern end of the dwarven district in a building), who wants you to take a package to Mountaineer Stormpike in Loch Modan. Grab it - it'll be worth good xp down the road.<br/>
<br/>
Now, head to the eastern end of the Dwarven district, go through the portal, and catch the Deeprun Tram to Ironforge. Watch out the sides, the view's pretty fun. Wink<br/>

And that completes part 1 of my guide. Part 2 will continue where this one leaves off, and go over Kharanos and Thelsamar/Loch Modan quests. Once my fingers are a little less sore. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/smileys/Yellow/smile.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="=)" alt="=)"><br><br><font class="SmallFont">[Edited by Revith at 2:13 AM on 11/21/2004]</font><hr class="ForumHR">Revith - Content Manager - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://wow.warcry.com/">WoW WarCry</a></div></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td class="ForumHeader" align="center"><div style="padding:3;"><font class="SmallFont">11/20/2004 10:59AM</font></div></td><td class="ForumTable1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td style="padding-left:3px"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></a><span id="549377" name="549377"><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" border="0" class="ForumBaseTable"><tr><td align="center" class="ForumHeader" valign="top" width="175"><div style="padding:3;"><b class="BaseFont"><b><font color="#3399FF">Revith</font></b></b><br><font class="SmallFont"><b>Content Manager</b><br><br><div style="width:px;height:px;background: url('https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/avatars/World_of_Warcraft/Human20.gif') no-repeat 50% 50%;"></div><b>Posts:&nbsp;</b>914<br><b>Joined:&nbsp;</b>3/30/2004<br></font></div></td><td class="ForumTable2" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%" height="100%"><tr height="20"><td class="ForumHeader"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td><div style="padding:2;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/read.phtml?f=113&amp;id=549377#549377"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/arrow.gif" border="0" height="12" width="12" hspace="2" alt="Link to this Post"></a>&nbsp;<font class="SmallFont">(In Reply To:&nbsp;<a href="read.phtml?f=113&amp;id=548886#548886">Human and Dwarf starting walkthroughs (human first)</a>)</font></div></td><td align="right" valign="top"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/post.phtml?f=113&amp;reply=549377"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/reply.gif" alt="Reply to Message" border="0" height="20" width="20"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/scripts/profiles/send_message.phtml?site=19&amp;freply=549377"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/private.gif" alt="Send Private Reply" title="Send Private Reply" border="0" height="20" width="20"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/forum.phtml?f=113"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/reload.gif" alt="Return to Index" border="0" height="20" width="20"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><div style="padding:3px;height:100%;"><b>RE: Elwynn Starting Quest Walkthrough (Parts 1 and 2)</b><br>Part 2<br/>
<br/>
So, you've made your human, gotten a few levels under your belt, and found your way to Ironforge.  Now, you're surrounded by short, smelly beasts that are destined to be your allies for a long time to come.  When you're done weeping at the thought, gather yourself, and head out the doors of Ironforge (stop and get the gryphon link first), then head down the path to the southwest, and head into Kharanos.  You should have a handful of quests to get here - Tools for Steelgrill from Tharek Blackstone outside the smithy, Beer Basted Boar Ribs from Ragnar Thunderbrew outside the inn, and Frostmane Hold from Senir Whitebeard by the tents.  The best one to do first is Tools for Steelgrill, which will take you northeast to Steelgrill's Depot.  First, though, on the left side of the road, just north of town, is a little cave set into a hill with two gnomes.  They'll give you a quest called Operation: Recombobulation.  This one will let you kill, I shit you not, leper-gnomes.  It is, in my humble opinion, the high point of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, on to the depot.  You can turn in the tools for a bit of xp, and collect three other quests from dwarves around the depot - Stocking Jetsteam, Ammo for Rumbleshot, and The Grizzled Den.  Ammo for Rumbleshop is a delivery quest, just run south down the road until you see a tent with a few dwarves, at the bend in the road.  On the way there, you'll pass an interesting little site.  Yes, it's a dwarven Mortar Team.  And, for a bit of nostalgia, stick around until they do their trademark yell.  It caught me offguard, and I was grinning for the next half hour.<br/>
<br/>
So turn that in, and run back.  Kill any bears or boars you see along the way.  Next you can do The Grizzled Den, which is just southwest of Kharanos.  You'll drop off a little cliff into a valley, and the Wendigos will be hard to miss.  If there are people outside camping them, don't sweat it - the cave is BIG, I've yet to find it fully cleared.  After you have all the manes, finish up the boars and bears for Stocking Jetsteam, and go turn those two quests in.<br/>
<br/>
You should now get a quest called Evershine, which will send you to a little outpost to the west called Brewnall Village.  Head on over (there's a little mountainous region in the center... you can either sweep south past the Wendigo cave, or go north then west along the frozen river, and then south along the shore of the frozen lake, either way works) and get the next step in Evershine, called A Favor for Evershine.  You should also pick up Bitter Rivals and The Perfect Stout.  All three quests have one thing in common - they're all about alcohol.  One involves gathering brewing components, another involves doing a favor to get a sample of some brew, and a third involves switching some brew barrels to play a trick on someone.  The dwarven spirit is alive and well, my friends, and it's getting sloshed mid-afternoon.  It brings a tear to my eye.<br/>
<br/>
So head west and start killing things.  You'll have to kill some bears, cats, and boars for A Favor for Evershine.  And near those will be the leprous gnomes, milling around outside of Gnomeregan, and you'll have to kill some of those as well.  So just start tossing gnomes around, offing bears, slaughtering boars, whatever floats your boat.  Once you've completed those two quests, take a quick jaunt to the south, along the western wall, and you'll find Frostmane Hold.  Kill the headhunters, run inside a bit (the right path is the quickest completion for the exploration, if I remember correctly), and return to Brewnall.  Turn in those quests, get your new quests, and head back to Steelgrill's Depot and Kharanos to turn in those quests.<br/>
<br/>
Now, two quests in the area remain... one which you have (The Perfect Stout), and one which you don't... Tundra MacGrann's Stolen Stash.  Now, The Perfect Stout requires that you climb up the mountain near the frozen lake, and kill some troll shamen, and loot some baskets.  Now, this one can be a bit tricky, as trolls often travel in pairs, run for help, and generally aggro more of their filthy ilk.  Not as filthy as leprous gnomes, but still, filthy.  And they hurt more.  So you might want to pair up for this one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, after you do that one, there's only one more quest in the area, and that one's pretty hard to describe.  There are some various ridges and hills that sit halfway between Kharanos and Brewnall Village.  In one, there's a cave with a mean-ass Abominable Snowman wanna-be calling itself Old Icebeard.  Right across from his cave is a slope you can climb, and on the far side of that ridge is a dwarf who needs to eat this winter.  The damn wanna-be bigfoot thing has stolen his beef jerkey, so you'll have to get it back.  If you go head-to-head with the thing, he'll toss you around and beat you like a red-headed step-gnome.  Instead, sit back and wait for him to wander out of his cave.  Then run in, grab the stuff, and run out.  No fighting is necessary to complete this quest, and the xp is pretty tasty.<br/>
<br/>
So, you're pretty much done with Kharanos after that.  You probably have a quest to talk to Senator Barin Redstone in Ironforge (The Reports) and one to deliver some booze to a guard in Loch Modan (Shimmer Stout).  The Senator is in the king's chambers near the center of Ironforge - turn that one in if you feel like it, but it doesn't lead anywhere, and I'm often too lazy to hike it up the hill. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/smileys/Yellow/smile.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="=)" alt="=)">  Anyways, your next stop is Thelsamar in Loch Modan, but there are a few quests you might want to do along the way.<br/>
<br/>
As you run along the road to the east, you'll see a fork off to the north, just before you get to Gol'Bolar Quarry.  Head over to the farmhouse, and you'll get a quest called Protecting The Herd, asking that you knock off Vagash, some random-ass named creature sitting in the hills above you.  Wrap around southwest, then north up the path when you can, and you should come across his cave.  He's tough - you'll need a friend or two.  If you're solo, skip this one until later.<br/>
<br/>
After you either kill Vagash or pass him by, head to the Quarry.  There, you'll get two quests - The Public Servant and Those Blasted Troggs!  Drop into the quarry, kill the grimy-ass boneheads (you'll be killing them for about thirty levels... they're the Dwarves version of Defias), and continue esat along the path.<br/>
<br/>
You'll eventually hit a fork in the road... both paths lead you past guard towers you need to go to, and into Loch Modan.  The northern one, however, has a nice quest, called The Lost Pilot.  I'd head north if I were you, get the quset, and find the corpse of the dwarf that's 'missing' just across the road on the slope of a path.  That'll ask you to avenge him... kill the bear, turn in the paw, and continue along.  (Yeah, I can tell what you're thinking, and it's true.  Anytime somebody is 'lost'... they're not.  They're dead.  A  "find the missing person" quest is "find what remains of the hapless dumb-ass, and bring it back as a memento."  Without fail.)<br/>
<br/>
Once you pop out in Loch Modan, you'll be at a tower which, miraculously, is the destination for a quest you got back in Elwynn.  Deliver Stormpike's package, pick up two new quests (Filthy Paws, which requires kobold-killing, and Stormpike's Order, which is the reverse of the one you just did - it takes you back to Stormwind.  Pick it up for when you head back to Westfall.)<br/>
<br/>
So you've grabbed those two quests... now head south to Thelsamar.  Grab the quests there (Thelsamar Blood Sausage from the Inn, Rat Catching from the wandering guard, and possibly a quest I've never done - Honor Students.  Thottbot is claiming it's there, but it's new to me.  Could be a good quest, grab it if it's there, and do the quick gryphon journey it looks like it asks of you.)  Then head south down the road to the next guard tower, which should have two quests for you - In Defense of the Kings Lands (step one of four, more troggs) and The Trogg Threat (... yeah, I know, troggs again).  After you grab those, head northwest up the road back towards Dun Morogh quick to turn in Shimmer Stout at THAT guard tower, and get Stout to Kadrell.  Go turn it in at Thelsamar, and you're ready to start in on Loch Modan quests.<br/>
<br/>
First, it's time to kill more Troggs.  Just southwest, before the mountain pass, is a camp of Stonesplinter Scouts and Stonesplinter Troggs.  That's as good a place as any to start.  If that's overcamped, head south a bit until you see a path break off to the east - that will take you to the main trogg area, and up front you'll find the mobs you need.  Regardless, kill troggs, turn in quest, get step two, of the same name, to kill more troggs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, your first instinct would be to run back to the main Trogg area and kill more Troggs, these a little higher level.  This is a good instinct - troggs are filthy, related to dwarves, and need to die.  However, I'm going to advise you pass on this one, and hold off a bit.  Instead, it's time to kill some kobolds.  In a little bit you'll have another quest which sends you to a different trogg area, with the same mob type.  So you might as well be efficient about killing the buggers, and hold off a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Take a moment and kill forest critters for the Blood Sausage quest.  Then, it's time to kill kobolds.  You may need help on this one - it's sending you into the Silver Stream Mine north of Thelsamar (on the far side of the hill) and you'll have to fight 3-4 kobolds at a time sometimes.  Grab a few friends and go kill the bastards, collect their ears, grab the supplies (little stacks of boxes 3 or so high scattered around the mine), and turn both quests in.  Now, it's time to head to the lake.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's named Loch Modan.  Yes, there's a Loch Modan monster.  Several, in fact.  Therefore, when you head across the lake to do get this next set of quests, I advise you run south along the ground.  Poke your head in and see the creatures if you'd like... then stay on land like good people, run along the south end, past the wagon with a few dwarves, and then veer east to the excavation site.  There, you'll get a quest to go back to Thelsamar (which we'll do now) and a quest to collect idols (later).  Run back to Thelsamar, turn in the quest, fly to Ironforge, turn in the quest, fly back to Thelsamar, turn in the quest, then run to the wagon you passed earlier at the south-east tip of the lake.  After a short little event, you'll get an escort quest to protect a dwarf that heads to the excavation site.  Help the guy out, and complete that quest, and then proceed with the idols (yay, more troggs).  If you have friends around, or if you're high enough to solo it, do it.  If not, put it off for later.  <br/>
<br/>
After you complete it, or if you decide to pass it by, head east to the corner of the map, where you'll find a little hunting lodge.  You'll get two quests, one to kill crocolysks (found on the island in the center of The Loch), and one to complete a timed kill quest.  Friends make this one a BREEZE, but you shouldn't have any problem.  You'll do two of them, killing birds just west of the lodge, then boars north of the lodge.  At that point, if you're high enough (level 15), another NPC (Vyrin Swiftwind) will give you a quest to kill an elite bear. But you'll probably have to come back later for that one - don't worry, you'll have five or six quests you'll have to come back for scattered around here, it's normal.<br/>
<br/>
Then go kill crocolysks on the islands in the Loch (PLEASE try not to get eaten by the monster, it's bad form, and gives him indigestion), turn them in, and, while running around in that area, stop by a little gnome who wrecked his flying craft, on the eastern shore of the lake, around the middle.  He'll ask you to collect his supplies.<br/>
<br/>
And now you kill the troggs for the quest you got earlier.  While you collect the supplies.  Yay, efficiency!  The northernmost island in Loch Modan is populated by Troggs.  They're in four different camps - one on the southeastern tip, one inside some ruined walls, one on the northwestern tip, and one on a little smaller island to the west.  Go to the latter island and kill the mobs, and get your tools.  Then kill the mobs at the northwest camp, and get those tools as well.  Now, run all the way back to the southern guard tower, turn in step 2 of In Defense of the King's Lands, and run back to the island.  The southwestern camp holds the mobs you need, and tool set #3.  Tool set #4 has the same mob types, and is just inside the walls, at the foot of a wagon.  Grab 'em, turn the quest in at Bingles, and turn the third In Defense of the Kings Lands in at the guard tower.  He'll give you quest step 4, but unless you're with a stout group of friends, you can hold off on this one.  It's time to head for Westfall.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you're leaving some quests behind.  You'll have In Defense of the King's Lands to do.  You'll also have Ol' Sooty's quest, which you get at 15.  On the Stonewrought Dam, there's another quest line (A Dark Threat Looms) that has about eight steps, but you can't get it until 16, and it will involve killing elite ogres.  There's another quest involving the same ogres, called Mercenaries, which you get in Thelsamar.  And finally, on a wanted poster in Thelsamar, there's a quest to kill the boss Ogre, Chok'Sul.  You can't get THAT one until 17.<br/>
<br/>
And now it's time to head to Westfall, back on the Alliance side of things.  Yes, more bandanas are in your immediate future. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/smileys/Yellow/smile.gif" border="0" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="=)" alt="=)"><hr class="ForumHR">Revith - Content Manager - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://wow.warcry.com/">WoW WarCry</a></div></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td class="ForumHeader" align="center"><div style="padding:3;"><font class="SmallFont">11/20/2004 8:11PM</font></div></td><td class="ForumTable1"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td style="padding-left:3px"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></a><span id="550010" name="550010"><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" border="0" class="ForumBaseTable"><tr><td align="center" class="ForumHeader" valign="top" width="175"><div style="padding:3;"><b class="BaseFont"><font class="MsgAuthorFont">mundak1</font></b><br><font class="SmallFont"><br><div style="width:px;height:px;background: url('https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/avatars/World_of_Warcraft/wow4.gif') no-repeat 50% 50%;"></div><b>Posts:&nbsp;</b>77<br><b>Joined:&nbsp;</b>3/20/2004<br></font></div></td><td class="ForumTable2" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%" height="100%"><tr height="20"><td class="ForumHeader"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td><div style="padding:2;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/read.phtml?f=113&amp;id=550010#550010"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/arrow.gif" border="0" height="12" width="12" hspace="2" alt="Link to this Post"></a>&nbsp;<font class="SmallFont">(In Reply To:&nbsp;<a href="read.phtml?f=113&amp;id=548886#548886">Human and Dwarf starting walkthroughs (human first)</a>)</font></div></td><td align="right" valign="top"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/post.phtml?f=113&amp;reply=550010"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/reply.gif" alt="Reply to Message" border="0" height="20" width="20"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/scripts/profiles/send_message.phtml?site=19&amp;freply=550010"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/private.gif" alt="Send Private Reply" title="Send Private Reply" border="0" height="20" width="20"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920/http://forums2.warcry.com/forum.phtml?f=113"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050214231920im_/http://forums2.warcry.com/gfx/reload.gif" alt="Return to Index" border="0" height="20" width="20"></a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><div style="padding:3px;height:100%;"><b>RE: Human and Dwarf starting walkthroughs (human first)</b><br>&nbsp;First step in the walk though should be delete and start over as a horde race that has some character and back story.
