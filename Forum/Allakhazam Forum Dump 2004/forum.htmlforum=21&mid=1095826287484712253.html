      <div class="body">
        <div class="post-text">I was in the WoW Stress Test and since then been following the beta boards and read about this. Just for those who haven't been following it, it basically breaks down to this..... <br> <br><b>Before this patch came to be</b>, mana was regenerated every tick if you were casting or not(I believe a tick in WoW is 5 seconds(mana regen was based on your character's spirit)). Because of this, casters put Spirit as being a more important stat than Intelligence enhancing items. Intelligence having the effect of increasing your mana pool but having no effect on the rate mana regenerates at. As long as you regen mana fast enough, the size of your mana pool really wasn't important. <br> <br><b>After the patch came to be</b>, The effects of spirit were increased so mana(AND possibly health I believe(Health doesn't regen due to spirit while in combat(that was true before and after the patch))) would regenerate even faster than before, BUT now you don't start to regenerate mana for 5 seconds after you finish casting your last spell. Problem being that more often than not you, as a spell caster of any mana using class, cast often enough that you may actually not regenerate ANY mana during a fight. <br> <br>While I hear a lot of whining on the boards, this is probably a good thing. Before intelligence was being almost completely ignored as a stat for a caster and not it's important, <b>AS IT SHOULD BE!</b> I think the real problem here is the resistance to change or what is being seen as a &quot;nerf&quot; when it is really a correction to make things as they were meant to be all along. The purpose of spirit seems to be to help decrease downtime between fights and <b>THAT'S IT!</b>. There is a reason you don't regenerate health during a fight. Now there is a reason you don't regenerate mana during a fight also. You CAN regenerate mana during a fight but it means actually medding a while without casting. Not only CAN you regenerate mana during a fight, but because the effects of spirit were effectively TRIPLED you can gain more mana faster than before. The cost though is not to cast for a short time. <br> <br>People can say I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm not in the beta, but I think it's <b>because</b> I'm not in the beta and my character wasn't effected by this that I can be more detached and logically objective over this than someone who is playing and upset by the change. <br> <br>Come release, to most people this will just be the way it is from the beginning because for them that WILL be the beginning, and it will be a very accepted thing. It has a definite purpose and it serves it. Now your mana pool matters and it really should have mattered. It's because it didn't that this change had to be. <br> <br>I think the smartest thing Blizzard did was start a new beta server NOW, after the patch. Reasoning is now new players will come to the game after this change and they will be able to see it in effect from the &quot;beginning&quot;. The new server is just that, a new beginning. Now that Hunters are a class offered from when people first started playing(being the new testers invited to play), I think you will see them more welcomed in groups than on the older servers. On the older servers Hunters are a relatively new class, one that people did without for a long time so once they came to be, no one wanted them in groups because they did fine without them before. <br> <br>My main reason for writing this is because this is an insight I had into this change and I just can't post it on the beta sight because it's beta testers only. I'd hope a beta tester might link this to the official sight as I think it is a reasonable insight to the change and might help people better understand the reason behind it. <br> <br>Btw, let me know how this patch helped Hunter's pet's DPS. Before they were little more than meat shields with no DPS. I know Blizzard doesn't want Hunters to be over-powered, but the pets definitely needed to be dealing more damage(That was my class during the stress test obviously. I didn't have any problem grouping during that time btw as that was also a &quot;new beginning&quot; as I was talking about before, but I've been following people's threads about the Hunters). <br> <br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Sep 22 00:14:26 2004 by KerikDaven</span></i></div>

        <div class="post-text">Well, playing a Hunter, I'm sure you know the class isn't finished and that they are still tuning it. Pet DPS is supposed to have gone up, NO talents are in yet, so while I myself plan to play a Hunter, I really don't see it as a useless class, merely an incomplete class. Once properly tuned I'm thinking it will be a better than average class. Like it or not, the pet needs a reasonable DPS itself which it didn't have and Blizzard is working on fixing. I think when Hunter was released they wanted to keep it tame to start with and build it up from there rather than starting too powerful and THEN having to nerf it. <br> <br>I'm sure Spirit has other purposes, but as it is now I'm not certain what they are. Also keep in mind that I'm not playing anymore so really don't get to see what that is. Food and Drink are ALSO for between battles.  <br> <br>I really liked the Hunter &quot;as-is&quot; when I played it and am really look forward to seeing how they improve it. Pet damage was my only real concern at the time. Maybe if I'd played other classes first I wouldn't feel the same but I'm doubting that. While my server was down I did make a Rogue on another server. While the Rogue was cool, it just wasn't what I really wanted to play. <br> <br>Peace. <br></div>

        <div class="post-text"><b>While I hear a lot of whining on the boards, this is probably a good thing. Before intelligence was being almost completely ignored as a stat for a caster</b> <br> <br>Intelligence was always favored by mages, who could summon their own drinks for between combat, and could blow anything out of the sky by simply burning through their mana. <br> <br>The class this change hurts the most are priests, whose casts are reactionary. A mage can wait 10 seconds and then cast 3 nukes in quick sequence. A priest has to heal when people are hurt, notwithstanding anything else they might want to toss in they'll need to lump in with their heal. I tried playing around this principle solo and partnered with a warrior, and the feel of the game in trying to do that is just plain weird. If I don't go out of my way to not cast for a while, I am simply out of mana, and the group isn't going to want to wait for me to drink just because I &quot;can't manage my mana.&quot; (And that claim is valid, whether I like it or not.) <br> <br> <br><b>Before intelligence was (not useful)...not (sic) it's important, AS IT SHOULD BE!</b> <br> <br>Intelligence makes sense as a key stat for mages and warlocks, but I would think spirit would be a more significant statistic for druids, priests, shamans, and paladins. <br> <br> <br><b>The purpose of spirit seems to be to help decrease downtime between fights and THAT'S IT!. There is a reason you don't regenerate health during a fight. Now there is a reason you don't regenerate mana during a fight also. You CAN regenerate mana during a fight but it means actually medding a while without casting. Not only CAN you regenerate mana during a fight, but because the effects of spirit were effectively TRIPLED you can gain more mana faster than before. The cost though is not to cast for a short time. </b> <br> <br>This is wrong in so many ways. <br> <br>The purpose of spirit is to help your ability to recuperate after strenuous periods - call it &quot;will&quot; if you like. It was not so you can sit on the sidelines and do nothing for 1 minute rather than 1.5 to regain your mana, when you can just drink and get it back in 20 seconds. And that IS the official purpose of food/drink in the game, as per Blizzard. <br> <br>You don't regenerate health in combat because mobs don't, and mobs don't because that was a super-annoying aspect of EQ I imagine the dev's wanted to escape. <br> <br>The effects of spirit were more than tripled, actually. However, I have gone entire battles where, because of triggered casting, (meaning things happened that prompted me to resort to a spell,) I have not regen-ed anything at all, and either my groupmates went on to another fight relatively quickly (because they didn't see me on the ground drinking - I was regenerating instead!) or I was solo and didn't feel like waiting around all day for mana I should have had already. <br> <br>The &quot;cost&quot; is to not cast at all. You don't seem to realize just how long five seconds is in a fight. My usual solo demeanor previously was to melee, and cast a particular spell as it refreshed, which had a cooldown timer of 8 seconds. Now if I do that, I'm basically nixing all mana regen altogether. The two alternatives are two cast my other nuke which is *horribly* mana inefficient, or to just melee, which is *horribly* time inefficient and still forces me to heal mid-fight, which is a spell. <br> <br> <br><b>Come release, to most people this will just be the way it is from the beginning because for them that WILL be the beginning, and it will be a very accepted thing. It has a definite purpose and it serves it. Now your mana pool matters and it really should have mattered.

It has no definite purpose that I can understand. Mana pool has always mattered - it mattered even more last patch than before when spirit was nerfed (as a supposed bug.) Now that spirit is back to what it was, despite the removal of combat drinking that was the real issue, all this does is force me to continue to not even consider spirit as a worthwhile statistic in this game, and SERIOUSLY affect my strategy -- in fact, I would dare say it removes strategy from this game because when I cast a spell, I say &quot;omg I need to keep casting stuff while I'm not gaining anything already.&quot; <br> <br><b>People can say I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm not in the beta, but I think it's because I'm not in the beta and my character wasn't effected by this that I can be more detached and logically objective over this than someone who is playing and upset by the change. </b> <br> <br>I can see how you might think this is a legitimate argument, and in some cases it would be, but in this particular case your lack of knowledge outweights your unbiased objectivity. <br> <br> <br> <br>For what it's worth, I started a new character on the beta 2 server, which I have gotten to level 14 thus far, also a priest. I reasoned with all the changes, it might not be a bad idea to start fresh, at least for practice's sake. The low-end game is WAY harder than it was before due to this change. Inexperienced players are going to be dying way more than necessary, whereas before the newbie areas had a good balance. As it is, I'm having trouble playing my class, and I know what I'm doing!</div>

        <div class="post-text">Additionally, I should add that this strongly facilitates the use of two or more healers in rotation during a difficult encounter. There are one-group battles of this nature - you don't need a raid for this to occur. And the maximum group size is 5. So this change is also implicitly forcing players to fill 2 of their 5 slots with a healing class, one with a tank, and one with a DPS/CC class. So the group has 2 {priest, druid or shaman}, 1 warrior, 1 {mage or rogue} and that leaves everyone else begging for the last slot. Why even play a hunter, warlock or paladin? The last spot is for DPS, and those classes are less desirable for that role. <br> <br>So basically, what I'm saying is, this change forces even more class balance issues on the players than previously existed. What was earlier considered implicit by the players has now become explicit.</div>

        <div class="post-text">Azuarc, <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">The class this change hurts the most are priests, whose casts are reactionary. A mage can wait 10 seconds and then cast 3 nukes in quick sequence. A priest has to heal when people are hurt, notwithstanding anything else they might want to toss in they'll need to lump in with their heal.</div></div> <br>In a good group the main tank is taking the majority of the damage, they shouldn't be needing heals as fast as the caster can cast them or your group is in over their heads. This is where the mana pool(Intelligence) becomes important. With a larger mana pool you can go longer without going oom. You also don't HAVE to be casting. As the Mage player stated, they are mixing it up melee style and ALSO regaining mana, that's a very realistic and more fun approach for the priest to use too. Many Cleric types like playing the &quot;Battle Cleric&quot; role. <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Intelligence makes sense as a key stat for mages and warlocks, but I would think spirit would be a more significant statistic for druids, priests, shamans, and paladins.  <br></div></div>  <br>Spirit is for mana and health regeneration only, This is not Everquest and Spirit isn't a renamed &quot;Wisdom&quot;. ALL spell caster classes mana pools are Intelligence based. See.... <br>http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/characters.shtml <br>...that's it for Spirit. You tried to dispute my view of the purpose of Spirit, so if you have anything that really better disputes my view, other than your word, please link it. Till then I'll listen to Blizzard's take on it. As far as my saying it's for between battles, it currently seems to be(since health isn't regenerating during battle and the regeneration of mana is restricted0 so I feel I had it detailed correctly. As far as food and drink, I agree with you. Spirit is basically &quot;free&quot; regen though where food and drink must be bought, looted or crafted through cooking. Food and drink are also the prefferred method since they are much faster. <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Just because you are naive as a new player doesn't mean that &quot;the way things are&quot; is right. It has no definite purpose that I can understand.</div></div> <br>Just because you are naive as a beta player and don't understand the purpose for the way things are now doesn't make them wrong. Spirit was being used in place of intelligence by many players.  Because of this, things had to change to make intelligence more important and the stat it was meant to be. You must adapt to the way things are. Now that this change is in place they will see how casting is effected. There is a <b>STRONG</b> chance they may re-evaluate the costs of certain spells and lower their casting cost to set things more in line with the way they want them. This change had to come first though before they could do that. <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I can see how you might think this is a legitimate argument, and in some cases it would be, but in this particular case your lack of knowledge outweighs your unbiased objectivity. </div></div> <br>Actually I think my knowledge is just fine. Besides having actually played the game(though only for a short period), I have a brother who has been in beta phase 1 since the beginning, and have also been following all the posts(official and player made) on just about everything I could want to know about. I think perhaps your bias may be limiting you in your objectivity. <br> <br>The point I am making about the release is that new players won't be bogged down with thoughts about how this 5 secs &quot;messed things up&quot; and will just accept it as the way things are and adapt accordingly to making the best of it. Between now and then Blizzard with either cause Intelligence to add even more mana to your mana pool than it does now and/or lower the costs of spells.... so that you can have more versatility and not be as limited as you currently feel you are because of this change. <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">what I'm saying is, this change forces even more class balance issues on the players than previously existed.</div></div> <br>Once the mana issues are better sort out as I explained above, this won't be such an issue. I'm certain there is a further plan here and this is just part of the road to get there and not the end result itself. <br> <br> <br>Finally, if you don't agree, that's fine. I'll have my point of view and you'll have yours and we'll just have to agree to disagree. Please don't knock what I know though as you don't know me or what I know and you're just making foolish assumptions based on your preconceptions of who you think I am. You are making you ideas based on your point of view and I am getting my thoughts from having listened to well over 30 people's thoughts, feelings, fears, and insights on this particular topic. Not counting all the other topics I have been following. <br> <br> <br>Stumpy,  <br>I agree with you fully, you roll with the punches, adapt and move on. Cheers to you mate! <br> <br>Jaefo, <br>Actually I didn't ask how Hunters were doing, I only asked about the pet situation as I know this recent patch tuned pet damage a little. Hunters will count on their pets a lot and as talents are added, other pet trainable abilities are added, and pet damage is better tuned, Hunters will be a much more viable DPS class. I'm disappointed to hear you being so negative about the class though. It needs work and isn't finished and everyone knows this. To expect miracles now is just silly. If it really bothers you, you might want to put it on the side and wait till it's better tweaked rather than suffer playing a class you aren't enjoying. <br> <br> <br>Peace out everyone, keep the posts coming. I enjoy other points of view even if I disagree with them. It all makes the world go 'round.</div>

        <div class="post-text">Jaefo, <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I have a 44 Hunter. Hunters are still basically worthless in groups, as their utility is basically nil and the DPS they do isn't as much as a rogue or mage who also have better utility (sap, sheep, mage AE, etc.) Now, I don't really have a problem getting a group, but if I were looking to get a group together, hunter is the absolute last class I would look for.  <br> <br>Luckily, other people don't seem to realize how not-that-great hunters are, or are just having pity on poor little me. <br></div></div> <br>Actually I didn't assume anything, I merely read your post. That sounded rather negative to me. *shrug* silly me for thinking so. <br> <br>Redmoonxl,  <br> <br>I'm sure 3 months after the game we'll be making our comments about the way the same should work as well. Because I have such an interest in the game though I keep an eye on the state of the game as it is now. As everyone knows it's still changing. In the case of the 5 second cast rule, a lot of people are complaining about its effect on them but I'm really not hearing anyone trying to figure out why Blizzard did it. This post is actually an attempt to figure the reasoning behind it in support of Blizzard. It's not that I'm a &quot;fanboy&quot; of Blizzard, I just feel there is a purpose behind it more than just &quot;we felt like doing it&quot;. To me it feels like step-one in a number of changes that will be made to make Intelligence matter more than it did before. While it is speculation, it comes from a strong logical deduction that Blizzard knows what they are doing here and has a purpose. The problem is no one is thinking past this change and merely complaining about it. <br> <br></div>

Oh how I hated that Charge - Hamspring -Charge combo *cough* thats another subject. <br> <br>All I have to say is that in certain situations, its better if we actually experienced changes first hand then stand in the sidelines and call on it.

        <div class="post-text">Agree Red.  <br> <br>I think with this rule, Melee players or hybrids have a little more of a chance against a caster whose mana pool was almost unending.

        <div class="post-text"><b>In a good group the main tank is taking the majority of the damage, they shouldn't be needing heals as fast as the caster can cast them or your group is in over their heads. This is where the mana pool(Intelligence) becomes important. With a larger mana pool you can go longer without going oom. You also don't HAVE to be casting. As the Mage player stated, they are mixing it up melee style and ALSO regaining mana, that's a very realistic and more fun approach for the priest to use too. Many Cleric types like playing the &quot;Battle Cleric&quot; role.</b> <br> <br>So what you are saying is...when I'm in an instance, where the warrior is taking damage as fast as I do outside of an instance, I don't need to be healing him as often as I would heal myself outdoors, and I don't even need to be healing at all? That'll get me kicked out of groups real quick. <br> <br>Also, what happens when the warrior isn't taking the majority of the damage? It does happen on occasion, and I need to be prepared to compensate. Even the better players will inadvertently draw aggro occasionally, so you can't just say &quot;your group should play better.&quot; <br> <br>I know how to do the battle cleric role. (Never mind that caster weapons were nerfed this patch.) I will also use my wand for ranged damage rather than casting nukes. Trust me, I know all about being mana efficient. <br> <br> <br><b>Spirit is for mana and health regeneration only, This is not Everquest and Spirit isn't a renamed &quot;Wisdom&quot;. ALL spell caster classes mana pools are Intelligence based. See....  <br>http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/characters.shtml  <br>...that's it for Spirit.

What I specifically said was that because I am not in the beta and my character is not being affected by this change I can be more detached from the change and not take it as an insult, nerf, or detriment to my playing and think more logically about why it was done. That's all. I'm really not sure where you're getting your ideas about what I'm saying, but you're saying things I never did. <br> <br>Let's start from the beginning here..... <br> <br>5 second cast rule was put into effect, why? <br> <br>No one really seems to care about the why, simply what it did to them. Did it have a purpose? Or was it just done on a whim? <br> <br>To answer that we have to look at the current state of the game. From what I've been seeing, MOST mana using players have been selecting items that enhanced their Spirit statistic over Intelligence enhancing items. Why are they doing this? Especially when they all know Intelligence is what determines how much mana they have. Simple... If you can regenerate mana fast enough, it doesn't really matter how big your mana pool is. With a high Spirit you get mana back as fast, or nearly as fast, as you are using it. Because of this fact, a high Intelligence is not important. <br> <br>From Blizzard's point of view this is no good. Intelligence is supposed to be the most important stat for casting spells. All spell casters should be seeking to increase their Intelligence if they want to be good casters. If it's not important, then we have to make it important. How do you do that? Simple, you have to make the size of your mana pool more important. How do you do that? Simple, not let it regenerate as fast, or at all, during a fight. Now you will only be able to cast as many spells as your mana allows. If you have a larger mana pool, you can cast more spells. How do you get more mana? Simple, increase your Intelligence. To make up for the fact that you are not regenerating much,or any, mana during a fight, we will increase the regeneration of mana and health between fights by increasing the effects of Spirit. Lastly, we will even grant more mana per point of Intelligence. Now Intelligence is more important to casters, less Spirit is more effective(meaning that even if you lowered your Spirit by HALF, you'll still regenerate health and mana faster than you did before the patch) so you can swap out Spirit increasing items and swap in Intelligence enhancing items without reducing downtime. Now the game can still continue at a faster rate than most other games allow, and we have set the character's statistics to the way we originally envisioned them. <br> <br>With these change though, they will have to monitor casting as a whole and see if it is working as intended. If the 5 second cast rule proves too restrictive in not allowing enough spells to be cast, then either: the casting costs of spells will have to be re-evaluated; the amount of mana granted by Intelligence increased; or the rule might have to be shortened by a second or two. IMHO though, the 5 second rule will stand. It's having the effect they were looking for and more likely than not they will alter the mana pool and/or casting costs. <br> <br> <br>That is the point of my post re-explained, and hopefully more easily understandable. <br> <br>As far as the thread you linked, I've read that already myself, been following others as well. Thanks though. While you are right, the boards aren't the truest representation of the game, you can usually figure out the truth pretty easily. You just need to realize the difference between people whining and people making valid points. They generally aren't too hard to tell apart though. <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Quote:---- <br>Spirit (SPT)    <br>Increases Health and Mana regeneration. Spirit affects all characters' Mana and Hit Point regeneration rates in and out of combat. Spirit also increases your chance to ‘proc’ with weapons. <br>-- <br> <br>My emphasis. We've already discussed how HP don't and never have regenerated in combat, so clearly that &quot;in and out&quot; statement is directed at mana. </div></div>Perhaps health also regenerated during combat in alpha build, or it was their original vision of how it should work, but quickly changed it for reasons similar to the problem they are having with Intelligence. If health regenerated during combat, raising Stamina would be less important than raising Spirit. Obviously they are altering their original definition to mean out of combat for both now, or in the case of mana to a very limited amount of regeneration during combat. <br> <br>I'd like to believe that I've convinced you that I have a good grasp of the current situation and the mechanics behind it even without actually playing. As I said though, I did play for 10 days during the Stress Test, and have been following everything on the boards since. Besides that, I've been playing RPGs since I was 8 and using computers since I was 12 and am now 34. The last 5 years I've been playing Everquest, have played Ultima Online, Anarchy Online and DAoC, so I have a pretty solid background in these kinds of games. Not to mention being in EQ2 and Matrix Online betas. Out of any game I've played online though WoW impresses me the most. Once I'm in any of the phases of beta(open, or if I can get myself into it, closed beta) I can see myself not playing another game other than WoW for many years to come(and just to cover it, yes, I'll still play retail release of WoW if I can't get into any of the phases of beta). <br> <br>Last quote I'd like to address is...<div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">You're going on the assumption that you DO understand the purpose for the way things are, and therefore provide the counterpoint. (My previous statement of this sort, btw, was the general 'you'. I wasn't singling out KerikDaven.)  <br></div></div> While I could be wrong, I do feel that the reasons I've stated are in fact the reasons behind the change. Thinking about it logically, this is at the least a very sound and plausible possibility. I did though take what you said as being directed more at me than being a generality as most of the post was directed at me(which wouldn't be unreasonable as I DID start this post :D ) <br> <br>Excuse my being a wise-*** in reply to your reply, but you kind of set the tone for that yourself. You seemed to take some of my post in ways not intended and also didn't give me credit for having a clue as to what I'm talking about. Deductive reasoning is a very powerful tool and that's mostly what I'm using here. A judge, lawyers, and jurors are not present at the scene of a crime, yet they find truth and reason from what was formerly abstract and chaotic. In this case the boards are my abstract and chaotic and I'm searching for the elements of truth in them. Granted, my grammar could be better but I've always been more math and science minded. :P <br> <br>Mark my words though.... this &quot;5 second rule&quot; is not the end result but the first step of a few. They just want to change casting so that it will be more Intelligence based than Spirit based.</div>

        <div class="post-text">PvE the change is easier to adapt to.  Now that I've done a decent sized raid with the change...not so much.  If you happen to survive long enough to run out of mana, which I did, you become a chearleader for at least thirty seconds to a minute. <br> <br>My question is, in PvP and PvE with these changes, would you rather have more rogues than mages now, and shammies and druids than priests in raid groups.  Rogues aren't mana dependant.  Shammies and Druids both can do added DPS while waiting for mana to regen. <br> <br>Balancing for both PvE and PvP, and solo v group v raid is not an easy thing to do.  I hope Bliz can balance them all equally, but I doubt it.  I'm not knocking Bliz, I don't think anyone can do it. <br> <br>Mage and Priest are my favorite classes right now, but considering the majority of endgame will be raid or large group oriented, I wouldn't play either if release was tomorrow.  Druid is looking better and better with the versatility they have. <br> <br>As a side not, it would be funny to watch a mage and priest go at it melee because neither has any mana ^^ <br> <br>Also, I received another beta invite and I have no idea why.  I ask a GM in game and he said they accidently sent them out to some existing beta testers.  I have a friend that may want it.  If not, I'll give it to someone on these forums. <br> <br>Another point not brought up is that mobs don't follow the new rules given to players.  Bad idea.  If my warrior can't charge when in combat then a mob shouldn't be able to.  While fighting Seers tonight with the new mage a rolled, they were regaining mana while we were fighting and I wasn't   :( <br> <br><i><span class="sm">Edited, Fri Sep 24 04:59:31 2004 by StumpyWSF</span></i></div>

        <div class="post-text">No, you never said you had any measure of authority. But you did imply that your unbiased objectivity gave you a better position to talk from.

I'm not trying to belittle you. <br> <br> <br>As an aside, I'm sure you're aware that Enoyis has posted on the boards the official reasons the 5 second rule were put into effect, as follows: <br> <br><div class="quote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">1) At higher levels spirit regeneration becomes so large it becomes very difficult to balance mana costs of spells against the spirit regen. The regen gets fast enough so that you can regenerate the mana back from a casting in one &quot;tick&quot;.  <br> <br>2) The new system differentiates Int from Spirit much more. There are concrete reasons why each is effective in different cases. High spirit is good for long extended fights, Int is better when you want to cast is shorter bursts. Under the old system, all spirit did was in effect extend your mana pool.  <br> <br>3) Spirit used to be so effective as to make the mana efficiency balance of various spells irrelevant. If you rarely run out of mana, then why does it matter to cast a long casting time spell with better mana efficiency?  <br> <br>4) It does add more strategy to how to cast spells. In most fights, you can ignore the 5 second rule, since all that matters is your ability to finish the monster off. In longer fights, you can pace your casting to conserve your mana.  <br> <br>5) Yes, Mages now cannot kill as many monsters over an extended period of time. This is intentional, and brings mages more inline with other classes. Mages can kill monsters much faster than any other class, this is balanced against they have some additional downtime after the fight.  <br> <br>6) We have always intened for every class to spend some time in combat doing non-casting related activities. Casters do decent melee damage and have wands to supplement your casting with. The new system allows you to still burst cast, but there is a penalty attached to this sort of gameplay.  <br> <br>Lastly, we have tested the game pretty extensively using the new rules and are pretty comfortable with how it plays. Please try to adapt, because at this time we do not have any intention of un-doing the change.</div></div> <br> <br>Basically you've been arguing along the lines of #2 in this thread. I personally think all of Eno's reasons are ridiculous though. I don't think this method is the proper solution to any of those problems, except maybe #2 insofar as it makes spirit worthless and int all-important, so yes there's a difference between the two.</div>

        <input type="hidden" name="oc" value="I was in the WoW Stress Test and since then been following the beta boards and read about this. Just for those who haven't been following it, it basically breaks down to this.....

[b]Before this patch came to be[/b], mana was regenerated every tick if you were casting or not(I believe a tick in WoW is 5 seconds(mana regen was based on your character's spirit)). Because of this, casters put Spirit as being a more important stat than Intelligence enhancing items. Intelligence having the effect of increasing your mana pool but having no effect on the rate mana regenerates at. As long as you regen mana fast enough, the size of your mana pool really wasn't important.

[b]After the patch came to be[/b], The effects of spirit were increased so mana(AND possibly health I believe(Health doesn't regen due to spirit while in combat(that was true before and after the patch))) would regenerate even faster than before, BUT now you don't start to regenerate mana for 5 seconds after you finish casting your last spell. Problem being that more often than not you, as a spell caster of any mana using class, cast often enough that you may actually not regenerate ANY mana during a fight.

While I hear a lot of whining on the boards, this is probably a good thing. Before intelligence was being almost completely ignored as a stat for a caster and not it's important, [b]AS IT SHOULD BE![/b] I think the real problem here is the resistance to change or what is being seen as a &quot;nerf&quot; when it is really a correction to make things as they were meant to be all along. The purpose of spirit seems to be to help decrease downtime between fights and [b]THAT'S IT![/b]. There is a reason you don't regenerate health during a fight. Now there is a reason you don't regenerate mana during a fight also. You CAN regenerate mana during a fight but it means actually medding a while without casting. Not only CAN you regenerate mana during a fight, but because the effects of spirit were effectively TRIPLED you can gain more mana faster than before. The cost though is not to cast for a short time.

People can say I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm not in the beta, but I think it's [b]because[/b] I'm not in the beta and my character wasn't effected by this that I can be more detached and logically objective over this than someone who is playing and upset by the change.

Come release, to most people this will just be the way it is from the beginning because for them that WILL be the beginning, and it will be a very accepted thing. It has a definite purpose and it serves it. Now your mana pool matters and it really should have mattered. It's because it didn't that this change had to be.

I think the smartest thing Blizzard did was start a new beta server NOW, after the patch. Reasoning is now new players will come to the game after this change and they will be able to see it in effect from the &quot;beginning&quot;. The new server is just that, a new beginning. Now that Hunters are a class offered from when people first started playing(being the new testers invited to play), I think you will see them more welcomed in groups than on the older servers. On the older servers Hunters are a relatively new class, one that people did without for a long time so once they came to be, no one wanted them in groups because they did fine without them before.

My main reason for writing this is because this is an insight I had into this change and I just can't post it on the beta sight because it's beta testers only. I'd hope a beta tester might link this to the official sight as I think it is a reasonable insight to the change and might help people better understand the reason behind it.

Btw, let me know how this patch helped Hunter's pet's DPS. Before they were little more than meat shields with no DPS. I know Blizzard doesn't want Hunters to be over-powered, but the pets definitely needed to be dealing more damage(That was my class during the stress test obviously. I didn't have any problem grouping during that time btw as that was also a &quot;new beginning&quot; as I was talking about before, but I've been following people's threads about the Hunters).
