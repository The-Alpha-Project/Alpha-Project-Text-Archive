Haesoth was born in the city of Stormwind.  He was a completely normal child, apart from a large red scar on the right side of his stomach.  Nobody knew where the scar had come from, and nobody knew why it was there.  And so it was overlooked, and the child Haesoth grew healthily and well.  At the age of 10, Haesoth, unusually tall and lithe for his age, was found examining the entrails of a dead dog in his small side room of his parent's Stormwind hut.  
<br/>
  His mother, horrified by what she saw, dragged the child from the carcass, which was lying in a horrifying rictous of terror.  Haesoth's father hit the child with a leather strap used to tie his boots to his feet until he bled, then left Haesoth spasmodically twitching on the floor.
<br/>
  Haesoth was very much a changed person after this insident, and kept to himself from then on for the most part.  No longer did he play with his friends out on the street, chasing each other through the alleyways, playing with carved wooden animals and the like, but brooded about his room in an odd manner.  Haesoth's mother reprimanded his father for being the cause of their son's sudden change and demanded he apologize.  Haesoth's father, named Darx, did no such thing.  Instead he now treated the boy even more harshly, nicknaming him "wretch" or "sprog" on a variety of occasions.  Haesoth seemed not to hear the insults or abuse, and kept to his brooding.
<br/>

<br/>
3 years later, at the age of 13, Haesoth had emerged from his melancholic and eerie moods and become more stable and "normal", playing with his friends again.  His mother, Questra, was ecstatic with joy at having her son back to his usual self after such dramatic domestic times, and said to her husband, 
<br/>
  "How could i have doubted you, Darx, my heart?  You always know what to do in situations, you always did."  He stroked her hair tenderly,
<br/>
"Don't worry, i was as worried as you were, but am now quite horrified and ashamed at my actions.  No child deserves that sort of treatment from a father..."
<br/>
The couple stood watching the children play, Questra stroking her belly affectionately, knowing that once again she was pregnant with Darx's second child...
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>
A few days later, Questra and Darx were out at a Stormwind festival, leaving the lithe youth Haesoth alone at the hut to play with his good friend, Jianne.  They returned in jovial moods, enhanced by the consumption of ale and cheap wine.  As they entered the hut they called out to the children, hoping to present them with gifts they had bought at the festival market.  When no answer came, the tipsey Questra gave Darx a confused look, and walked to Haesoth's room.  When she came to the door, a horrendous smell suddenly erupted in her nostrils.  She coughed and as she opened the door called out,
<br/>
  "Haesoth, you little rogue, what are yo-" She stopped mid-sentence, and screamed.  What was laid on the floor in front of her was a scene of utmost terror.  The boy Haesoth was kneeling over the body of his friend Jianne, her stomach carved open by the bellybutton in an awful jagged slice, her vital organs oozing out onto the wooden planks.  Darx ran to Questra's side, and as soon as he saw what his wife was witnessing stepped back as if struck by a fist.  
<br/>
  He saw the horrible wound to the poor girl's stomach, and almost puked on the spot, but stopped himself to look up at her face.  At this image his eyes opened wide, his mouth agape with horror and fear.  Jianne's face was frozen in a hideous rictous of fear, but as he looked he saw one of her eyes move, blood welling at the sides.
<br/>
  Haesoth seemed not to have noticed them, and carried on prodding the girl's organs with long, controlled fingers.  His eyes were wide and a terrible smile curled on his lips.  This was enough for Darx, and he slammed the door closed in a frenzy, dragged his wife from the hut and went straight to a city guard, who was doing a daily patrol of the streets.  
<br/>

<br/>
When the guard came to the hut and entered the room in a cocky arrogance that indicated he didn't believe the terrified couple's story, he too stood there in shock.  He assessed the situation in silent terror, and aimed his spear at the chest of the kneeling lunatic on the floor, 
<br/>
  "Get back, foul creature of the Dark!" The guard spoke, "Or by the Gods i'll drive this spear right through your sick heart!"  Haesoth just curled his lip in that perverse smile once again, and laughed.  He stood up and walked straight at the guard, who gradually fell back under the boy's advancement.  The body of Jianne could be seen twitching slightly out of the corner of his eye.  Haesoth stopped, and stepped back again.
<br/>
  "Leave Stormwind, demon-child.  Your kind are not wanted here."
<br/>
"Then why don't you slay me, Guard?" Haesoth replied, the grin still on his face.
<br/>
  "Because.."  Darx cut the guard short,
<br/>
"Get out of here, wretch, before i force my boot so far down your vile little throat!"
<br/>
  Haesoth looked up at his father, who looked like a great enraged bear in his fury.  "So be it," said the boy, as he walked back to the corpse.  He bent down and kissed the dead girl on the forehead, cast one last glance back at the 3 horrified people - scrutinizing them as if savouring the moment - and jumped out the window.  Haesoth of Stormwind was now in exile.  It would not be long for the guard to rally others to try to track him, so with all haste he made towards the South, and in the South lay Elwynn Forest and Duskwood...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Haesoth: Nomad</span></span>
<br/>

<br/>
The deranged boy ran from the hut, heading straight for the open south gates of Stormwind.  Thoughts were running like a supernova through Haesoth's mind as he tried to understand the strange forces issuing throughout his young body.  He felt... powerful.  That was the word.  He felt as if he held all the power of one of the mighty Gryphons that took men to so many places.  He felt fantastic.
<br/>
  The boy waited for the guards who were guarding the South Entrance to turn their backs, then ran for the gate.  He went by unnoticed.  In front of him, only a few hundred metres away, lay Elwynn Forest.
<br/>
  He set course for it in the dark...
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>
A month later, and Haesoth was lying on the damp ground under a large tree in Elwynn Forest, dying of hunger and thirst.  He fell into blackness...
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>
Haesoth woke up in the warm confines of a fur tent, wrapped in furs.  His mouth felt dry and clammy, and he was very weak.  He looked to his right to find a tall man in leather armour, sporting a large bronze broadsword in a scabbard at his side, sitting nearby.  
<br/>
  "Thought you were going to die on me, boy," The burly warrior said, "Here."  He handed Haesoth a waterskin bulging with water.  Haesoth drank deeply, the water cool and refreshing.
<br/>
  "Thank you," The boy replied through cracked lips.
<br/>
"Not to worry.  Couldn't exactly leave you could we?" He replied gruffly, "My name is Seuthus; leader of my nomad tribe.  You would do well to rest."  
<br/>
  Haesoth nodded to this, and slumped back into a welcome sleep.
<br/>

<br/>
A while later he woke up to the sound of lute music and laughing.  He shook off his aches from sleep, and turned to see a loaf of bread and some more water next to his bed.  Haesoth picked the loaf up with shaky hands and bit into it, pulling off a large chunk.  Nothing had ever tasted so good.  After not eating for a month, anything would've tasted good to the boy.  After wolfing down the small loaf, and drinking deeply once more from another waterskin, Haesoth tried to stand up.  
<br/>
  It took a while to get used to it, and the dizziness to subside, but after a couple of minutes he managed to make his way to the front of the tent, and opened the flap.  
<br/>
Outside, there was maybe two dozen other tents like his own, and a few small campfires.  He looked around and realized that they must be in a clearing in Elwynn Forest.
<br/>
  Haesoth saw a group of girls in their mid-teens dancing to a lanky, bearded man playing a lute around one campfire.  Memories of that night in the hut flooded back to him, and Haesoth felt a quiver of lust grow in him to replicate it again.  
<br/>
  Now is not the time, he thought.
<br/>

<br/>
He waded forward, suddenly aware of many eyes watching him.  Lumberjacks hacking branches off dead trees for campfires stopped to look at him suspiciously, then surepticiously continued their work.  Picking out the huge figure of the proclaimed leader of the tribe, Haesoth made his way towards him.  The man was quite noticably drunk, three flagons of wine lying at his feet, two of which were empty.
<br/>
  "Ah, and so he comes out of his slumber.  Come!  Sit!"  The dark haired chief exclaimed to Haesoth, "So, what was so bad that forced you to starve yourself out in the forest, lad?"
<br/>
  Haesoth made up an elaborate story of how he was picked up whilst walking in Elwynn Forest by Defias Thieves, and how they had left him to die.  Seuthus acknowledged his story, stating, "Yes, there are lots of those rogues wandering the forest, i can understand that".
<br/>
  Seuthus stood up suddenly, reeling with the effects of the wine, and shouted, "Loyal people, i bid you welcome young... erm, i don't know your name, lad..."
<br/>
"Haesoth," The boy interjected.
<br/>
  "...young Haesoth, into our tribe.  He is now a part of our community - respect him as your equal."  He let the words sink in, then carried on, "now if you will excuse me, i will reclaim my old tent and get some sleep!"  Seuthus strode towards the tent Haesoth slept in, and disappeared behind the flap.  
<br/>

<br/>
Haesoth stood there awkwardly, then a tall, lithe man of similar build to himself came forth and led him to another tent, introducing himself as Lourm.  This was to be Haesoth's new home.  Lourm said that he would teach Haesoth how to quickly take down the tent and tie it down to make it mobile in the morning, and bade him goodnight.  
<br/>
  Realizing that he was still tired Haesoth entered his tent, made way to the furs in the middle, and slumped down, falling asleep almost instantly...
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>
Six years later, and Haesoth had been living with the same tribe, under the same leader, for all that time.  He had grown taller, now 6ft2, and his body was toned and strong from the lumberjacking work to which he had been assigned.  However, he had not forgotten his perverse pleasures that had originally driven him away from his native city of Stormwind, and he frequently at night wandered into the forest to further his strange cravings on the wild Elwynn deer.
<br/>
  
<br/>
The strange power that had come about him on that night he killed and mutated Jianne returned, stronger and more beckoning each time he performed his "arts" on hapless animal victims.  The tribe inhabitants looked upon him with relative scorn, thinking Haesoth to be strange and "foreign" to them, not to mention brooding and weird.  He wore his hair long, black and untidy, his ice-cold blue eyes seemed to look straight through people and his stooped, loping walk frightened the young children.  Haesoth didn't mind, he would leave the tribe eventually and travel the world, he had decided a year ago when he was 18.  Then he could put these fools behind him.
<br/>

<br/>
On the sixth year of him being there, Haesoth was sleeping in his tent in a glade near Duskwood.  He dreamt...
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Haesoth was walking in a strange place, full of green-skinned behemoths wielding axes and huge longswords.  He guessed that these were Orcs from tales he had overheard around the tribal campfires.  Suddenly the image disappeared, and everything was black.  He saw something move to his left.
<br/>
  "Who goes there?" The brooding young man called out.  In front of him flames erupted, and a hideous beast, twelve feet high with the face of a nightmare; glowing red eyes, like giant lanterns, slits for nostrils, and terrible rows of inch-long teeth.  Haesoth stepped back, terrified.  Then it spoke,
<br/>
  "Ah, why you have it flowing strongly in your blood. Yesss..."
<br/>
"I...i have what?" Haesoth answered, shakily.
<br/>
  "Why, the forces of the Burning Legion of course," Answered the gargantuan being.
<br/>
Haesoth was reeling, he was terrified, "And what does that mean?"  The demon snarled at him, a disapproving look on his face,
<br/>
  "I thought you would be clever enough to know that yourself."  It waited for Haesoth to think for a second, then carried on, "It means you could aspire to become... Warlock."  It waited to let this register, "Do you accept your fate?  Do you accept the Way of The Warlock?"
<br/>
  Haesoth brought himself upto his full height, no longer afraid of the demon after hearing this, and said boldly, "What do i recieve if i accept it?"  The demon grinned at this, and replied,
<br/>
  "Powers beyond your reckoning, mortal... here."  It pointed a taloned finger at Haesoth, and suddenly Haesoth felt exhilerrated and strong beyond imagination.  It was like the sensation he felt whilst mutilating Jianne, except a hundred times better.  "You like?"  The demon smiled a cruel smile.
<br/>
  "Yes," Haesoth replied, "I will take the Way of the Warlock."  The demon then laughed, and said, 
<br/>
"Very well!  You are now of the Dark Brotherhood.  At my touch you will recieve powers through the Burning Legion, channelled through our very veins."  The demon reached forward... and touched Haesoth on the shoulder.</span>
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>
Haesoth woke up, a cold sweat breaking out all over his body.  There was a lancing pain on the right side of his body, and he looked down.  The sickening scar that he had randomly had since birth was glowing a bright purple.  He was horrified, and started hitting it to make it stop.  It didn't stop, but just got more ferocious.  After five minutes of enduring the pain, Haesoth looked back down at the scar.  It had disappeared.  He recollected the dream suddenly, and smiled.
<br/>
  He looked down at his hands, and saw little purple sparks dancing from one fingertip to the next.  He pointed a hand at a nearby flagon of wine.  Suddenly purple energy exploded from his hand, and the flagon was immolated in indigo fire.  Haesoth laughed,
<br/>
  "I am... Warlock!"  Then a seering pain erupted in his head, and he heard laughter.  Then a voice, the voice of the demon from the dream, could be heard in his mind,
<br/>
  "Yes... you are.  Do not disappoint me, Warlock, for it is my powers you will be channelling.  What is your name?"
<br/>
"Haesoth, demon," Haesoth replied.
<br/>
  "Hmm... we will have to discard that methinks.  It is the last fruit of your humanity.  I will give you a new one.  Henceforth you shall be known as Kalazor, meaning Black or Lonely One.  Is that understood?"
<br/>
  "Yes," He replied.
<br/>
"Good.  Call upon me when you seek guidance, Kalazor.  I will always be here.  Until then, develop your powers, become strong.  Farewell for now, Warlock."
<br/>

<br/>
And so, Haesoth the Nomad became Kalazor the Warlock, and his life finally began to fall into place...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
UPDATE - Chapter 3:
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kalazor: Warlock
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kalazor left the camp in the dead of night, under the cover of darkness. He slipped past the tribal guards who were watching for signs of a raid easily, and made way for Stormwind.By now he knew Elwynn Forest well, and his passage through it was swift. 
<br/>
At one point Kalazor stopped as he caught sight of a wolf, feasting on the dead carcass of a deer. Kalazor grinned to himself sadistically and stepped out from the shadows. The wolf looked up in fear and let an aggressive growl escape its throat. The Warlock, still with the manic grin on his face, just kept coming forward, slowly raising his right hand.
<br/>
The wolf advanced, still issuing warning growls to the intruder. Kalazor stopped and stretched his arm full length, fingers trained on the giant canine. He stood like that for about five seconds, the forest silent during the time, giving the sight an eerie feel. Suddenly purple energy, like the energy that destroyed the flagon in Kalazor's tent, erupted from his fingers. Within seconds the wolf was enveloped in purple flames and was writhing on the floor. A voice sounded in Kalazor's head,
<br/>
"Soul drainnnn....."
<br/>
"What?" The Warlock answered his demon.
<br/>
"Here." The demon responded, and Kalazor's body was surrounded by a strange cyan light. Then, with his hand still outstretched towards the soon-to-be-dead wolf, the same cyan light surrounded the wolf's body. Then, like a strange ghostly spectre, the light started towards the Warlock's trained fingers. As the light hit them, he felt a truly overpowering experience come about him. It felt like he was in orgasm, the weird light acting as a stimulant. 
<br/>
"Ahh..." Kalazor groaned.
<br/>
"Ahh..." Said the demon, in unison, "Is it not the most wonderful experience, Kalazor? Do you not love the feeling of one's soul being consumed within you? Can you feel your strength rising, Warlock?"
<br/>
"I do," He replied meekly, overpowered by the sensation.
<br/>
"Now... imagine if this was a humanoid - the sheer magnitude of the experience would be immense!"
<br/>
Kalazor smiled at this, white teeth showing through the cruel lips, "Yesss... i shall like to experience it."
<br/>
The demon laughed, "So be it... to Stormwind, my loyal apprentice!" When the light had finally stopped seeping from the now dead wolf's body, Kalazor regained his composure and made for Stormwind once more, feeling satisfied beyond imagination...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
After travelling for forty minutes or so, Kalazor finally reached the gates of Stormwind, still exhilerated from his recent Life Drain. A guard keeping watch hailed him from the ramparts,
<br/>
"Who goes there?"
<br/>
"My name is Kalazor, i am a nomad who seeks shelter and a warm meal for the night." Kalazor could see the guard frowning in the light of the torch he was carrying.
<br/>
"fair enough," The Guard answered, "Do you know your way around?"
<br/>
"I'll manage, thank you." And the Warlock walked through the gates, careful to hide his hands which were prickling with purple static left over from his spell. As he came to the first street, Kalazor re-introduced himself to his old surroundings. He judged the way he wished to go to get to his destination, and head off in that direction.
<br/>

<br/>
After about five minutes he came to his old home, his parent's hut. It looked exactly the same as when he left it. He knocked on the wooden oak door. Within seconds a tall, pretty woman in her early 40's opened the door. 
<br/>
"Can i help you, Stranger?" She asked timidly.
<br/>
Kalazor smiled to himself thinking, "She doesn't know who i am! Excellent..." then replied, his voice strong and intimidating,
<br/>
"I believe you can. I would speak with your husband, Darx."
<br/>
She nodded and called, "Darx! There is a person at the door to see you." Kalazor's father soon came trundelling to the door. He had put on weight over the past six years, and was noticeably pale,
<br/>
"Yes?" He asked gruffly, "What is it?"
<br/>
"A word in private, if you don't mind," Was all Kalazor said. Darx eyed his son up and down, a suspicious look on his face.
<br/>
"So be it, Stranger. But make it quick." He opened the door to let Kalazor in. The Warlock stepped forward in his odd loping motion. 
<br/>
When he entered he looked around surepticiously, taking in everything. Then he noticed a toddler playing with some carved wooden toys in the corner near his old room. On closer inspection he realized that they were his old toys. A slight tinge of emotion started in Kalazor's chest, but he fought it down.
<br/>
"Where am i to go?" Asked Kalazor, "What i have to say is of utmost importance." He cast a glance to his old room on the right, "In here?" The Warlock queried in a supposedly innocent fashion. 
<br/>
Darx was about to say something, but Kalazor was already making his way to the room. He entered. Exactly the same as he had left it, just no dead Jianne on the floor. Darx came blundering forward into the room, not even trying to hide his annoyance as he said,
<br/>
"What is it you have to say?" 
<br/>
Kalazor didn't answer immediately, but picked up an old wooden carving of a snake, his old favourite, and started moving it through his long, tingling fingers. The sparks from his spell had subsided. After doing this for a few seconds, finally he replied,
<br/>
"Oh yes... what i have to say..." He turned to his father and lifted a hand in the direction of the door. It closed. Darx looked back at the door, horrified. He tried to open it, but it wouldn't move. Questra could be heard on the outside running across the room to the door, banging on it shouting, "Darx! What is going on?"
<br/>
"What i have to say..." Kalazor repeated. "What i have to say is that you are a filthy whoreson, and that your time has come to pay for your insult."
<br/>
Darx stopped his manic struggle with the door and turned to face him,
<br/>
"What insult?" He shouted, "I've never seen you in my life!" Kalazor shook his head at this and replied,
<br/>
"Surely you wouldn't forget your own son?" 
<br/>
Darx's eyes widened as he fell backwards, using the wooden beams on the wall for support as he said, "You! But you are dead!" 
<br/>
"No," Kalazor smiled, "Not dead, but very much alive. More alive than ever before... I am warlock!" His terrified father could say nothing, still holding onto the wall for support.
<br/>
"Darx!" Questra shouted.
<br/>
"It's okay, mother! Father is quite safe..." Kalazor replied. He couldn't help himself any longer, and burst into a fit of malicious laughter. The voice of the demon sounded once again in his mind, and he pointed his hand at Darx. Green energy erupted from his fingers this time, and suddenly Darx fell to the ground as if hit over the head with a staff.
<br/>
"We call this the Curse of Weakness, my apprentice," The demon said in Kalazor's head.
<br/>
"Thank you," The Warlock answered mentally. He then pointed a finger at the door again, and it burst open, Questra catapulting forward from behind it. She fell next to her unconscious husband, visibally shaken by the fall. 
<br/>

<br/>
Kalazor walked over the two bodies, and loped towards the child who was cringing in the corner, eyes wide with terror and the unknown. When he reached him, Kalazor heard his mother's sobs and pleads. They fell on deaf ears. He bent down and looked the boy in the face.
<br/>
"So similar... yet so different," The Warlock muttered, to no-one in particular, "What is your name?"
<br/>
"Nestar," The boy's reply was barely audible. Kalazor nodded, then suddenly his hand snaked forth and took hold of Nestar's neck. Questra's sobs were racking now, and were clearly heard by the Warlock. He paid no heed once more. He stood up, the boy's neck still gripped firmly in his hand. Nestar's face was beginning to turn red now, and Kalazor loosened his grip. He turned the boy in the direction of his mother. 
<br/>
"If you could cast me away with such ease, then you won't have trouble dealing with another," Was all he said. Then he suddenly increased his grip, stronger than the first by at least three times, and the sound of his brother's windpipe being crushed was sickeningly voluble. His mother fell to the floor once more, her sobs becoming hysterical crying. Kalazor loped forward quickly, still clutching the dead boy, and gave his mother a hard boot to the head. She fell unconscious without a sound...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kalazor left the hut at daybreak via a back window so he could escape the inferno without being seen. While his parents were unconscious Kalazor had lined them in a row with their dead son in his room, and immolated them on the spot with the help of his demon. By the time people knew there was a fire on and it was put out, the bodies would be burnt and Kalazor long gone. 
<br/>
He made his way to the city centre, wondering what to do with his time now. It only just dawned on him that he had no idea what to do now he had achieved his goal here. "Become strong" was what his demon had said. But how?
<br/>

<br/>
As he pondered this, he caught sight of a group of people talking around a table outside an inn. They were all wearing long, draped cloaks with a strange symbol on that Kalazor didn't understand. 
<br/>
"A guild" He thought. As he wandered on suddenly the thought struck home, "A guild! Yes! That is how i will become strong. I will join a guild, learn from others with similar skills to myself and hone mine to perfection. I must start searching at once."
<br/>

<br/>
But soon the notion dawned on him that not alot of guilds would accept someone who got his powers through the evil Burning Legion. He would have to choose wisely and carefully...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
He had been searching for days, and had almost given up hope. All the guilds around Stormwind were either "Fight for the Light" or "Struggle against Darkness" type groups. How would they possibly agree to allow a member of the Dark Brotherhood such as himself into their group? It was simple, they wouldn't.
<br/>
Earlier on he had bought some black gloves to cover his static-empowered hands with the money he had stolen from his parent's hut before he escaped the fire. He fidgeted with his half-full ale mug between them. News of the murdered family had come out now, and the guards were searching for the killer - himself. 
<br/>
When questioned he had let the demon put some sort of charm on the guard - convincing him that Kalazor was innocent. He hadn't been bothered since.
<br/>

<br/>
So engrossed was he in his thoughts, that Kalazor didn't realize the red-haired woman come towards him until she tapped him on the shoulder. He looked up,
<br/>
"What is it?" He asked, annoyed that his thoughts had been disturbed.
<br/>
"You're not interested in a proposition? Fine," She shook her head as she flicked a hand in a strop in his direction. Kalazor caught sight of a purple spark fly from one finger to the next and recognition dawned on him,
<br/>
"Wait!" The girl turned back, a curious expression on her face,
<br/>
"Yes?"
<br/>
"You're" He dropped his voice so as not to be overheard, "...warlock?" 
<br/>
Her eyes opened wide, and she replied sharply, a dangerous tone in her voice, "How did you know?"
<br/>
Kalazor smiled , "Your sparks." She frowned. "Don't worry, i am too." Then her expression changed all together. A large smile broke on her face,
<br/>
"As i suspected, come!" 
<br/>
"Hey, my beer!" said Kalazor and she laughed,
<br/>
"We'll buy you a new one, don't fret."
<br/>
The girl grabbed him by the collar and virtually dragged him from his seat, then bade him follow her into the inn. Once in there she led him to a large table in the corner.
<br/>
"So he is then?" A blue-haired human asked. She smiled and said,
<br/>
"Yes, he is. This is a rude and uncouth warlock, but i suspect he has a name?"
<br/>
It was Kalazor's turn to frown this time as he replied, "Kalazor." 
<br/>
"Okay... take a seat if you like," She said. When he didn't sit down, the girl asked impatiently, "Oh what's wrong now?"
<br/>
"My beer," Kalazor said simply, "I was under the impression i was getting a new one." Her mouth gaped open and she went to the bar, a disbelieving look on her face that made her look comical. 
<br/>

<br/>
The blue haired human was laughing, "By the Gods Kalazor, you really know how to annoy people don't you!" The Warlock raised an eyebrow in disapproval.
<br/>
"I'm joking, man. The name's HR." Still with eyebrow raised, Kalazor shook his hand, "I'll introduce everyone." He indicated a tall man sitting to the right of him, "This is Aries, he and Jette are partners... Jette is that woman who introduced you just now. And this is Lanthalasa," He nudged another dozing human sitting to his left, "This is Kevnya..." And so it went on, Kalazor taking in the names and faces from the various different races that HR pointed out sitting at the table.
<br/>

<br/>
When Jette returned she gave him his mug of ale and held out her hand, "Name's Je..."
<br/>
"I know," interrupted Kalazor.
<br/>
"Fair enough, well you may like to know that these are all..."
<br/>
"I know," the Warlock interrupted once again. 
<br/>
She ignored him, "...members of the Black Armada guild, and we would like to know if you would consider joining us?"
<br/>
Suddenly what she said registered in Kalazor's mind, and his reply was instant,
<br/>
"Okay."
<br/>
Jette was taken aback at the swift and unexpected answer and said,
<br/>
"Oh... erm.. great! Glad to have you on board!" 
<br/>
Kalazor smiled, "I look forward to it." As Jette smiled back and started to walk back to the bar to get the rest of the drinks for the guild, Kalazor continued, "Oh yeah... thanks for the beer!"
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
And so Kalazor the Warlock joined the Black Armada. He would learn swiftly that he would consider it not as just a vessel to become stronger, but as a community of fellow adventurers who he loved the company of and who he enjoyed himself with. Long live the Armada!

<br/>
Kalazor: Strange Beginnings
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
They left the inn in the early hours of morning, every last one of them quite blisteringly drunk. Even Kalazor, that lonely warlock, was pretty smashed. Kevnya Scope, the ex-Thieves Guild Rogue, was having to be carried by HR and Lanthalasa
<br/>
back to the Guild Headquarters. Various individuals had all wandered off in different directions during the trek to the large house, and some wouldn't turn up until later on in the day.
<br/>

<br/>
When the stumbling drunks had finally reached their destination, one guild member randomly started singing "Yo Ho Ho And A Bottle Of Rum". Jette, still with some wits about her, silenced him. Kalazor entered through the large oak door, caught sight of a couch near an empty fireplace, and slumped down - not even bothering to take in the surroundings of his new home. The rest of the guild members advanced towards the staircase. HR and Lanthalasa gave up on Kevnya when they failed to carry her up the stairs, and left her curled up in front of the staircase as they ascended solo.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kalazor dreamt once more - the images blurred and distorted because of the copious amount of ale he had consumed that night. He was walking through the dark alleyways of Stormwind, at night. After aimlessly doing this for hours it seemed, he came to a dead end. A cloaked figure was standing there in front of him.
<br/>
"Kalazor..." The figure said, as if to himself, "Finally i get the chance to meet you..."
<br/>
Kalazor tried to focus on the figure, but really couldn't, and so he replied dreamily, "Who are you?"
<br/>
"Why, i am simply a person who wants to help a sick man," answered the figure.
<br/>
"Really? I bid you good luck in finding him - now step aside!" Kalazor sardonically told the mysterious man - if he was a man that is.
<br/>
The figure tut-tutted under his hood, "Your sarcasm and threats won't get you out of this one, Kalazor - YOU are the sick man. Don't you realize that? Can you not feel the very essence of it growing inside you?"
<br/>
"I have no time for your games and prophecies, man. This is but a dream, now let me recover from my night in peace."
<br/>
"A dream?" The man laughed, "A dream? No Kalazor, this is not a dream. I could not converse with you any other way. I could not approach you in Stormwind due to your violent nature, and i could not approach you in your dreams beforehand because of your zealous demon."
<br/>
Kalazor's brow furrowed, "What should my demon have to do with you "conversing" with me?"
<br/>
But as the man started to reply, a large crash resounded in Kalazor's ears, and he woke...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kevnya Scope was lying face down on the large bearskin rug on the floor of the living area, having fallen over a bucket. Kalazor sat up,
<br/>
"Not a very stealthy rogue are you?"
<br/>
She smiled with an effort, but didn't reply.
<br/>
"Come, i'll help you up the stairs - you can't lie there all day," He said after a moment. He stood up and, with effort, walked over to where she was lying. He bent down to lift her up, but her dead weight was too much for a half-drunk, half-asleep person like himself. 
<br/>
"By the Gods you need to work with me, Kevnya," He said, prodding her with his boot to try to make her move more willingly, "I'm...never...drinking ale... again," He complained as he tried one last time to lift the now unconscious rogue. 
<br/>
"Ah suit yourself, i'm going for a walk," Kalazor stated, and left through the large oak door which he vaguely remembered from the last night.
<br/>

<br/>
It was a nice day. The sky was a sunburst orange-brown colour, ravens and starlings were flying around Stormwind's tall buildings or spires, people were jostling around bartering with stall-keepers. Kalazor strolled around the city in that strange loping fashion of his, brooding over the sudden turn of events. Suddenly Kalazor remembered something; a cloaked, hooded man, standing at the end of an alleyway.
<br/>

<br/>
He tried to remember where he had seen this person - where the sudden vision had come from. He was by now walking aimlessly around Stormwind, annoyed at his impotence to remember where this image originated. After a while Kalazor came to a park, where lots of children of many races were playing. One little Night Elf boy was stuck up a tree, and a burly human was trying to convince him to jump down so he could catch him.
<br/>
Kalazor smirked at this, and stood watching at the gates of the park for sometime. Eventually the boy closed his eyes and jumped - to fall into the man's outstretched arms to safety.
<br/>
"Curious..." Kalazor jumped as a voice spoke beside him. He removed his right glove in a movement like lightening and had his static fingers pointing at the intruding person's face. The man, quick as Kalazor, knocked the outstretched hand out of harms way and held it strong, 
<br/>
"Not wise, demon!" He said.
<br/>
"Who are you intruder?" Kalazor snarled.
<br/>
"That is not currently important," the man replied, still gripping Kalazor's right wrist firmly. "What is important is that you come with me immediately - Stormwind is in danger." Kalazor laughed at that, and snatched his wrist back,
<br/>
"And why, pray tell, should i believe you, Stranger? What care i for Stormwind?"
<br/>
The stranger shook his head, "Oh how your mind has been swamped, young Kalazor. Look," He extended his hand, offering Kalazor a long, curved dagger engraved with red runes along the hilt, "I am now unarmed - trust me! I beg of you." The Warlock narrowed his eyes, accepted the dagger, and nodded.
<br/>
"I will go with you, man. But rest assured - any funny business and i will burn your petty soul into oblivion..."
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
They walked for sometime, Kalazor getting more and more frustrated by the minute. Finally they stopped at a derelict thatched house on a cornerstreet.
<br/>
"We have arrived," The man turned and said, "Please, enter..." Kalazor looked the man up and down suspiciously, removed his gloves, and started to enter through the threshold. He stopped at the doorway, and turned.
<br/>
"This is yours," He said, "If i am to be murdered, a petty dagger won't make a horrendous difference." 
<br/>
"Thank you, Kalazor," The man answered, a relieved look on his face.
<br/>
At that, Kalazor entered the house. 
<br/>

<br/>
It was a dark and gloomy place, illuminated by dim candles along the compact walls. The Warlock took in the eerie atmosphere, and only when his eyes were accustomed to the gloom did he notice the hooded figure standing at the rear of the room. He stepped into the meagre light and approached Kalazor. 
<br/>
"I have awaited this moment long enough, Kalazor," He said, in a strangely distant voice.
<br/>
"Is that so? What is it you want, man - i am at a loss as to what all this commotion is about," The Warlock replied. The stranger lifted an eyebrow under his hood and replied,
<br/>
"You are unaware of what goes on in your mind then? The constant struggle for dominance... the WAR taking place in there this very second?" 
<br/>
"What are you talking about?"
<br/>
"Oh come now, Kalazor! I expected a being as meticulous as yourself to at least grasp that something was amiss here?"
<br/>
"Look, Seer, Magus, Priest or whatever the hell you like to think you are - what is going on?" Kalazor was angry now. He hated being devoid of knowledge. The stranger lifted up his hand,
<br/>
"Look..." the stranger said, and made a strange circling motion with his finger. Suddenly a massive window nearly the size of the room came forth in between the two men, and images started to appear. Kalazor saw war, strange demons with wings and spears and claws, coming together and fighting to the death. Blood was spilled, beings were killed. "Look..." The stranger repeated again, the sound of his voice strong in his mind even though they were separated by the screen. The image centred on a mighty creature, tall and baneful in the fury of battle. A snarl was curled on his lips, his eyes wide with pure malice and bloodlust - he was the demonic image of Kalazor himself. The human Kalazor watched in awe, a strange sensation filling his soul as he watched. He knew this thing - not from his similarity in looks, but he knew him.
<br/>

<br/>
The screen subsided and went back into the palm of the odd stranger's outstretched hand. 
<br/>
"And so you see your inner self," the man said darkly,"your... "demon"".
<br/>
Kalazor was still shocked by the sight, and replied, "But my demon is what makes me a warlock. What about Jette and the countless other warlocks around Stormwind?"
<br/>
"They are warlocks... you are not. You are nothing like a warlock. You, my good friend, are possessed." Kalazor's eyes widened,
<br/>
"Possessed? But... how?"
<br/>
"Warlocks do not have "demons", Kalazor. They get their power from the Burning Legion, granted - but they do NOT have a member of the Legion whispering in their ear and trying to take control of their bodies in order to gain a new foothold upon the world!" Kalazor felt hatred and rage start to grow inside him, and he had a compelling feeling to aim his sparkling fingers at the man - but didn't... he now knew why he had that compulsion. The stranger nodded, "I am Escarse, a warlock myself, and i will help you. You must cast the demon away - he now knows he is in danger of returning to his brothers in failure. He will launch a fresh assault over your body soon enough."
<br/>
"What must i do, Warlock?" Kalazor asked.
<br/>
"Leave Stormwind, go forth unto Dun Morogh - starve the demon of magic and blood, and he will show himself in due course. When he does... whether you will survive the counter i do not know. It is undoubtably a mighty being to have entered this world and at the word of yourself enter your entire being - you may never be rid of his essence."
<br/>
Kalazor nodded, "I will leave immediately." He turned and made for the door. The eerie surroundings of the house were forgotten, and he was already plotting his first move against his demon.
<br/>
"Oh and Kalazor," Escarse called, stepping towards him until they were nearly face to face, "You may need this," He held out a mighty battle-hammer, the wood polished with some sort of black varnish, dark demonic symbols etched into the blade... The possessed man nodded once more, turned, and left.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Kalazor rushed back to the guildhouse, the giant hammer gripped firmly in his hands as he ran. People stared and showed open exclamation at the sight of him, moving out of the way, letting him pass. Kalazor tripped over a wooden peg in the ground, and his head smacked against the cold stone. He got up, his head bleeding at the left temple, and continued with his run. 
<br/>
When he finally came to the guildhouse he was careful not to be seen. He kept to the shadows and made for the nearby stables. Once he got there he found a horse of maybe 15-hands grazing outside in the sunshine. He vaulted it swiftly, having had lots of practice due to his time as Haesoth in his nomadic tribe. As he calmed the horse quickly and uttered soothing words to it, the human with blue hair, HR, came into the open.
<br/>
"Where are you going, Kal?" He asked, confusion and shock registering on his face.
<br/>
But by the time that he said that Kalazor was ready and kicking his horse into a fast trot, soon to become a gallop as he made his way to the Stormwind gates. 
<br/>
HR hurried back into the guildhouse to consult the others...
<br/>

<br/>
****
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
5 months later, in a shallow cave in the heart of Dun Morogh, a man sat eating the raw meat of a wild boar. His hair was dishevelled and icey, his eyes sunken and red-rimmed, his left hand resting on the haft of a giant hammer. After the man finished his "meal", he picked up a handful of snow from outside the cave, and held it in his fist for a few moments. When a hint of moisture was felt he tightened his grip, and lifted it to his mouth. When he loosened his grip again, drops of foul tasting water fell onto his tongue. 
<br/>
He forced himself to swallow them, then collapsed, asleep on the cold floor of the cave...
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
He woke... Kalazor's bones ached and his limbs were stiff. He rubbed his eyes with a freezing hand to try to remove some of the crystaline ice that had settled there, and caught sight of something. He thought he saw a shadow flicker on the wall of the cave. With an effort he got up and lifted up the heavy hammer. He stood there at the ready, eyes darting around the place to see if there was any other disturbance. Suddenly the cave was filled with laughter in moonlit night.
<br/>

<br/>
"Kalazor... but why do you turn on me? I, who has given you so much power..." It spoke.
<br/>
"And so he comes," Kalazor whispered.
<br/>
The laughter could again be heard, "Yes, i have come. You will pay for rejecting me, Kalazor."
<br/>
"Face me, demon. Face me with honour!" Kalazor yelled, the adrenaline pumping.
<br/>

<br/>
"So be it," the demon replied. The cave, lit by the meagre light provided by the static of Kalazor's fingers and the moon, suddenly went even darker. Within seconds a looming figure, nearly a foot taller than Kalazor, was standing in front of him - wielding a huge hammer of similar design. His features, oh so similar to Kalazor's only held one difference - the skin was dark gray, almost black, "Succumb to me, Kalazor - you are no warlock, and you are no warrior, without me."
<br/>

<br/>
"Save your presumptions for after the fight, you whoreson!" Exclaimed Kalazor, and charged.
<br/>
The demon was unprepared for this, having thought Kalazor would wait for the onslaught instead of initiating it, and was thrown totally off balance. Kalazor seized the moment, and swumg his hammer over his head in order to build momentum, and had it crash down onto the reeling demon's ribcage. 
<br/>

<br/>
Huge bones could be heard breaking under the impact, and the demon howled with fury. 
<br/>
It looked down at its mangled ribcage and bellowed its rage - charging Kalazor this time. Furious strokes were aimed at Kalazor, but the human was solid as a rock and in his own fury was a match for the similarly furious demon. Several blows glanced off each other's bodies, and both had sustained horrific injuries.
<br/>
Kalazor's left leg was having to be dragged along due to it becoming so badly bruised, and his shoulder tendons were obviously ripped terribly with the effort of swinging the mighty hammer. 
<br/>
Kalazor stopped another blow with his hammer, the force of which sent him reeling backwards, off balance. The demon's lips curled into a smile, and he lifted his hammer for the final swing. Kalazor saw what the demon was about to do, and where he was about to aim. 
<br/>

<br/>
He was off-balance and weakened, but managed to heft his hammer again. As the demon swung with all his godlike might at Kalazor's skull, Kalazor similarly swung at the head of the opposing hammer. The impact must've been heard for miles. 
<br/>
The hammers were obviously endoured with some sort of supernatural strength and magic, and both became locked in stalemate to the left side of Kalazor's body. The demon looked at his opponant, eyes wide with shock. Kalazor looked at his opponant, eyes wide with hatred. 
<br/>
He then lashed out with his boot at the demon's unprotected shin, causing it to fall back, then launched into his own offensive, powered by sheer will and rage. Hammer blows from Kalazor's mighty hammer cannoned into the demon's stomach, chest, hip. Unrelenting, Kalazor kept it up until the demon was on his knees before him, its hammer limp in his hand on the floor. It looked up,
<br/>

<br/>
"You will never be free of me, Kalazor. I've explored the very depth of your being. You are one with evil. You are the same as I. We are one! Kill me if you will - although i may not have reached my objective, the damage is done. Your soul is tainted. You will be outcast once more!"
<br/>
Kalazor snarled as he replied, "Then so be it!" At that he hefted the hammer once more, and brought it crunching down onto the demon's skull. With the sickening crack of the impact, the demon fell to the cold ground.
<br/>
Kalazor took a deep intake of breath, bent down, and picked up the demon's hammer. Heaving it onto his shoulder, he made his way into the night. Bellowing a demonic warcry that he had used since becoming Kalazor the Possessed, he lifted the giant hammer of the Burning Legion above his head. He stayed that way for a good 10 minutes, and then collapsed onto the snow, exhaustion and trauma taking over him...
<br/>
