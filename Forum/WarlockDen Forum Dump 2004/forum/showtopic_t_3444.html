<br/>

<br/>
Since this game is obviously a strategy with a mix of RPG and MMOG this game will only use one "style" of combat. This style of combat is where you control your character to pick another person-controlled character or you can fight creeps and goblins alike. But this will have its limits. This will use a fighting style of a "turn based" system in which allows the character to choose his move and proceed with the action, thus avoiding the common error in many games which results in massed arrays of clicking and turning the game into a finger vs. finger rather than skill vs. skill. Once the character chooses the opponent the game logs you into a new mode, combat mode. During combat mode you start to select and plan your actions from the inventory and skills that your character has to offer, or has capable at that particular moment. During this spells are now allowed to be pushed upon your opponent. Also melee attacks and combinations are possible during this time. So the Combat in WoW will be like none you have ever seen, as it deals with perception of the situation, and then strategic thinking to make the move possible.

<span style="font-weight: bold">What are the methods to restore your mana?</span>
<br/>

<br/>
There are two ways to restore your depleting mana. The first option is to use a potion. As seen in many games potions are specific mixtures that serve a beneficial purpose it helping the status of your character. The potions will most likely range from minimal health gain to as much as two third of mana regenerated. The other option which is almost brainless is to simply depart from the situation that is harming your health and simply "wait it out" until mana automatically regenerates to a certain position that is suitable to either go back and fight or all together avoid the situation. But with downsides on each of the two options, this does play a toll into decision of how to obtain more mana. The potions may seem the most logical and the easiest way to overcome the deficit in your mana tank, but these have what is called a cooldown which is put into the game to limit the amount of potion wars in which the characters idle then attack when the person is low on potion count and low on mana. Along with the potions the "running from danger" scenario is also very dangerous, as in WoW there will be many traps looming behind each corner that could result in death if encountered and your boots aren't fast enough.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Can u fight a human controlled character?</span>
<br/>

<br/>
With all due respect Blizzard has taken this into their own hands, and after many symptoms of carpel tunnel syndrome and worn out jaws they have finally completed explaining to many die hard PvPers that this option will be included into WoW. But this is not a must fight situation. This stage of fighting will be optional in the game and you can participate if wished to. This also adds a bit on variety to the Combat which in return adds more excitement and more excitement equals longer lasting fresh anticipation.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">How is Death encountered and handled in this game?</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Like most normal games, with exceptions to cheats, death is "normal" in any game. Death adds a sort of real life embellishment to the game. This also avoids many problems of newbie control. As it will push aside the discouraged and unskilled and break through the more interested and devoted foes. Death will be handled accordingly: "A character will remain where he or she died for a reasonable amount of time (to allow for possible resurrection) or until the player chooses to "release" the character. After the player releases the character or the designated amount of time has passed, the character will reappear at a bind point with all of his or her equipment safely intact. Although there might be some penalty attached, our goal is to make sure that a character's death is not overly frustrating for the player." With this knowledge, this lays out the ground work for how the diseased will be dispersed. But as in many circumstances the topic of death is yet to be decided as Blizzard could introduce potions of maybe even an ankh of reincarnation that might speed up gameplay to a whole new tier, but for now the death examples seem pleasing to me, ironic or not.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Overview:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
World of Warcraft is a combat-based game, like most MMORPGs. While there are other things you can do (such as crafting and delivery quests), you will be doing a lot of PvE. The mini-guides below can help you decide what kind of character you will be playing, as well as strategies to use while playing that character.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Combat Types:</span>
<br/>
(Note that players do not have to be just one of the below types)
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Melee:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Melee fighters depend on their weapons and armor to defeat enemies. They have high HP and defense, as well as combat abilities and buffs. These fighters take the most damage from enemies, and are often referred to as "Tanks". Most melee weapons types (like swords, maces, axes, etc) are very similar, so we will not go over the differences in types until more information is known. Here are the types of melee fighters:
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2-Handed Weapon:</span> Many fighters use a 2-handed weapon (such as a sword, hammer, ax, etc). While these weapons are usually slower than their 1-handed counterparts, they deal much more damage. Also, armor reduces damage points, so a higher damage attack will result in more % damage actually being dealt. Some of these weapons at higher levels can have some good magical bonuses.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> More damage, magic bonuses, fast battles.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Slower attack, no shield, less protection.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1-Handed Weapon &amp; Shield:</span> Another popular weapon setup for melee fighters is the 1-hand weapon and shield. This is the most versatile, since it balances offensive (the weapon) and defensive (the shield). While you will deal less damage, you will also take less, allowing for longer battles and less chance of dying.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Shield blocking, increased armor, faster attack, less risk.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Slow battles, less damage.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Dual Wield:</span> The final option for melee fighters is the dual wield setup, which is only availible to the Hunter and Rogue classes. This effectivly allows you to deal twice as much damage as a 1h/shield fighter, and at higher levels you can learn blocking techniques (like the Assassin in Diablo 2). However, until then you will take more damage like the 2h fighter.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Twice as much damage as 1h/shield, higher levels can block, 2 weapons.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Only available to 2 classes, can't block until higher levels.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall Advantages:</span>Most HP/armor, easy to play, can solo.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall Disadvantages:</span>Takes most damage, usually dies the most, hard to escape an enemy, hard to take down large groups of mobs, weak vs ranged mobs, lower magical ability.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ranged:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Ranged fighters specialize in attacking from afar. Ranged weapons as rule deal less than melee weapons, since they can attack at a distance, and their attacks can also be interupted if hit while attacking. They usually wear light armor and have low HP, yet can move quicker and usually stronger in magic. All ranged weapons require ammo to fire (which you must keep in your inventory); fortunatly, some tradeskills will allow you to create these projectiles in the wild so you will not have to go back to town every time you run out. Also, some high level weapons may fire magic shots that do not require ammo. Most ranged fighters have a backup melee weapon in case a melee monster starts attacking them. Here are the types of ranged fighters:
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Gun User:</span> Dwarves (and maybe Gnomes) are the only races who specialize in using these mechanical weapons, but other races may be able to learn to use them. Guns vary in attack speed and damage, but generally attack slower and do more damage. As of now all of the known guns are 2-handed, but there may be 1-handed pistols.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Most damage, faster battles, chance to kill enemy before it reaches you.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Slower attack speed, can attract agro (since doing high damage).
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bow User:</span> Bows are the weapon of choice for most ranged fighters. They fire the fastest and are the most accurate. However, the damage is lower compared to the other types.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Faster attack speed.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Less damage, monster may get to you before you can kill it.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Crossbow User:</span> Similar to the gun in terms of damage and attack speed, the crossbow can dish out high damage at a slow rate. However, unlike the gun all ranged fighters can use this.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> More damage, faster battles, chance to kill enemy before it reaches you.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Slower attack speed, can attract agro (since doing high damage).
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall Advantages:</span>Can attack at a distance without taking damage, low risk, can pull mobs, good vs melee mobs, higher magic ability.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall Disadvantages:</span>Low HP, lower damage, more difficult to solo.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Spellcasters:</span>
<br/>
Spellcasters rely on their spells to take out mobs. These fighters have the most mana and the lowest HP. They can have many types of spells, ranging from direct damage to support (buffs) to crowd control like rooting and sleeping spells. Spellcasters usually cannot wear armor, just clothing (robes and such), so they have very low defense. They also usually wield a melee staff (for a strong, slow melee attack) and wand (for a week ranged attack). Here are the spell elements:
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Holy:</span> Holy damage is the power of the light, and is the element of choice for Paladins. These spellcasters have great healing powers, as well as auras. They also do extra damage vs Undead.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Healing powers, extra damage vs Undead.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Some monsters immune, less damage.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Fire:</span> Fire damage is the highest damage of all the elements, and has some spells that can damage multiple targets at higher levels.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Highest damage, multiple targets at high levels.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Not many support spells.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nature:</span> This element is used by the Druid, who is very much in touch with nature. Many of these spells are support type, like Entangling Roots which will bind your enemy for a set period of time. This element also has healing spells.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Many support spells, healing powers.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Not many direct damage spells.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Cold:</span> The cold element has a special effect of slowing down your enemy, which can help out immensely when playing in a group battle. It also has many support spells like binding spells and shields. To offset this, it deals less damage than other spells such as fire.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Support spells, slowing effect.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Less damage.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Shadow:</span> The shadow element is the power of the dark and of the Warlock. This element has some special spells such as life- and mana-stealing.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Advantages:</span> Life stealing.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Disadvantages:</span> Weak vs holy.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall Advantages:</span>Can attack at a distance without taking damage, can pull mobs, wide range of damage spells and support abilities, possible to solo.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall Disadvantages:</span>Low HP/armor, many monsters have spell type immunities.
<br/>
 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Pets &amp; Summons:</span>
<br/>
Several classes (like the Hunter and Warlock) can either keep pets or summon creates via spells. Summons are generally stronger but only last a set period of time, while pets are not. Pets also can level up with the character, so they become stronger over time. Here are some strategies when using a pet or summon with one of the above combat types:
<br/>
(Below I will refer to both pets and summons as "pets")
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Melee:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Melee characters usually use pets as another attacker that supports them against an enemy. The pet can buy you some time if you need to escape your enemy; it can buy you some time while you escape. These pets should deal a lot of damage but don't really need a lot of HP.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ranged:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Ranged characters use their pet as a meat shield, taking hits while they attack safely at a distance. These pets should have high HP but do not necessarily need to deal a lot of damage.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Spellcaster:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Similar to ranged fighters, spellcasters use their pet as a meat shield, taking hits while they attack safely at a distance. These pets should have high HP but do not necessarily need to deal a lot of damage.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Solo Strategies:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
WoW will not require players to be in groups at all times just to be able to advance in the game. In fact, most players will probably spend a good portion of their playing time soloing.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">One on One:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Players should be able to solo monsters of their own level fairly easily, if not they need to upgrade their weapons. If fighting a monster 1 on 1, try to keep it that way; do not attract any other monsters to join in the fight.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">One on Many:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Fighting a large group of monsters by yourself will usually end in death unless you are a much higher level than them, so avoid large groups. However, if you run into 2 or 3 monsters make sure to use disabling spells and abilities to disable the strongest mob while you attack the other(s). Also, always kill the weakest mobs first, going from weakest to strongest. Less monsters attacking for more damage is better than more monsters attacking for less damage since you can disable mobs and won't be interupted as much.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">One on Boss:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
When fighting a boss, first make sure that you have taken out all the minion mobs in the area; you will want to fight the boss one on one. Also make sure you have full health/mana/rage and all your buffs, you'll need it. If the boss is too high level for you don't try to take it on; you will die. When attacking the boss, make sure to start combat with your strongest attack, and keep at it. If you have healing spells, save your mana for those.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Group Strategies:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Groups are limited to 5 players in WoW, which is a managable number. Groups can take on stronger mobs than a solo person could, usually much stronger. There are also several areas in the game that the mobs are so strong that you will have to be in a group to survive. Make sure when in a group to give and maintain your buffs to the other team members.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Group on One:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
When fighting a single monster from within a group, you usually want that monster attacking the team member with the highest HP/defense, the tank. Make sure to keep your tank's (or tanks' if in a larger group) health up. Also, retreat if you are about to die - your allies will hold the monster back.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Group on Many:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
The most important thing when taking on a group of mobs while in a team is communication. Everyone will need to "focus fire" on the same mobs so they can pick them off one by one. Also, use the same strategies as the solo vs group: disable strongest mobs and take out the weakest first.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Group on Boss:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
When fighting a boss in a group, make sure everyone is fully buffed and healed. Also make sure there are no minion mobs still alive in the area. The strategies for attacking are the same as the Group on one, unless it is a really strong boss. If this is the case have the tank(s) attack the boss while being constantly healed by the other teammates.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Looting: <span style="font-style: italic">There are 3 types of looting in WoW:</span></span>
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Free-for-</span> Anyone can loot, good for taking out mobs at a quick pace or specialized mobs that drop things only a few members in a group would want.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Round Robin:</span> Each person in a group will have a turn to loot in a rotating cycle. Good for places where everyone would want something (even if it is just to sell).
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Master Looting:</span> Only the group leader can loot. Good for bosses as the group leader can split up the loot.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Misc Strategies:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Here are some miscellaneous strategies to use in certain combat situations in WoW.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Social Mobs:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
Some mobs in WoW will help each other out if one of their nearby buddies is attacked. These mobs are difficult to impossible to solo without a pet, so don't even try unless you are much higher level. If you have a pet or are in a group, send the pet/tank in to start taking hits and fight it like any other group mob.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Pulling:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
When fighting non-social mobs, you can "pull" monsters away from groups by attacking it with a ranged attack or spell. This will cause it to target an come towards you while you are still out of aggro range for the rest of the group. You can pick off a group one-by-one using this method.
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Respawning:</span>
<br/>

<br/>
If you are waiting for mobs to spawn (like for a kill X creature quest), the best thing to do is to move in a pattern around the surrounding area. This way you will see when and where the mobs respawn as well as have a view of other factors, like if there are any other players in the area and where they are. Be careful not to be near any group spawns, as they can spawn on top of you (and all aggro).
