For those who don't know what this is, here is a quote from the Patch notes:
QUOTE
Rest State

The Rest state modifier only affects experience earned from killing monsters. It does not affect experience earned from quest rewards or other experience rewards in the game (such as future PvP experience rewards).

As players kill monsters and gain experience points, they become increasingly tired. Their rest level reflects this tiredness in five tiers: well rested, rested, normal, fatigued and exhausted.

Well-rested players receive bonus experience points for killing monsters. Rested players receive a smaller bonus. At the normal rest level, players receive no bonus experience points for killing monsters. Fatigued players receive half of the normal experience points from their kills, and when exhausted they will receive a quarter of normal experience from a kill.

To become well rested and start earning bonus experience from killing monsters again, players must either log out or rest online at an Inn (see below) for several hours.

Thanks to the comforts of a warm bed and a hearty meal, players who rest or log out at an Inn can regain energy up to the maximum level: well rested (it takes 8 hours to go from exhausted back to well rested). Players who log out anywhere else in the world will only regain energy up to the normal level.

Note that while your character is resting at an Inn, you can play other characters on your account. The rest state is per character only.

This seems like a pretty damn atrocious idea to me. The only effect that this would seem to have is to punish the people who play a lot, it's like it's some incredibly nasty way to stop people levelling so fast.
What makes this worse, is the new skill system that Blizzard has implemented depends on experience gained from killing monsters, so not only will it be detrimental to your characters experience to play for long periods of time, but it will also make them progress even slower in the skills department, effectively making people who play less become better players!
Something else which doesn't really make sense is resting online at an Inn for several hours... What sort of insanely bored person would want to do this to get back to their well rested state?

The introduction of resting is well.. extremely restricting. I think that blizzard will remove this "feature" bbeacuase of how unpopular it seems right now. I think that no real comment can be made about resting yet until the push is throughly tested.

I can see some benefits from this such as point of investing points into survival if survival can allow players to rest up to well rested. The survival skill seems rather redundant right now an more fo a, "Wow I'm bored I feel like making a fun character."

All that said the game was great and I hope I can say the same about the push. See you on the next push chib. :cool:

After reading the beta forums and talking to some of the testers, I have changed my mind. :)
Most of your experience is gained through quests anyway, and it seems it's taking some people about 5 hours to get to "Rested".

What's really pissing me off is that all the nay-sayers haven't even tried it yet! I'm glad you came around Chib; I liked the idea. Blizzard wants players to get away from hack n slash and focus the game in other areas, and this resting bit sounds like a great idea. It will prevent people from level grinding for 16 hours. If they want to level grind, they can do it between characters.

Blizzard knows what its doing; they've done amazing things so far, why not this? Besides, it is beta, and that's what they are for. To test things. If the rest system doesn't work out, they'll remove it...simple as that. But honestly...I don't think they will.

*kicks the download* FASTER YOU! :)

I feel that this is good yet bad. Its bad because I feel that the times of resting and how lnog it takes to get tired are too unbalanced. At the same time this is good it gets people to do other things then just fight. Also I feel that this would be better applicated if they have more taverns. My only main problem with the resting idea is if the hours are too short for fighting. I'd rather have long hours fighting and a longer rest then short hours but less rest needed.

And i was actually wondering if the bonus exp is worth it.

I don't have the Beta, but I still think that the Rest system sounds like a great idea. For example, Diablo II. People do Baal runs for hours on end and back in the day people could go from 1-99 in a day by constant cow runs with a team of Javazons. With the rest system, it will make the game much more balanced, as well as all of the good points other people have brought up so far. Now all the people who spend 24/7 on the game won't have such a huge advantage anymore and it will make the game funner for all players. And of course, it will take people much longer in real time to get up to high levels... Keeping them in it longer, and since WoW is a Pay Per Month game... Well I just won't go into that right now.

However, even though they complain about it now, you know that they would be subscribed regardless. The point is to have fun in the game, not "win" per say. You can't really win in an MMORPG. Besides, if they didn't spend 24/7 grinding levels, they'll spend it exploring and questing. Oh no! Boo hoo! They can always switch characters. That, and if they COULD level grind, they would max out one character, and start another...and another...and another...*thinks of EQ*

Yeah. Bad.

I fucking love it.

I hate Baal runs. I've gone from lvl 1 to 67 in two days in a game where the max is lvl 99. That's way to fuckin' fast if you ask me, but everyone else is doing it. 90% of d2 never sees the light of day unless it's in the way of your damn Baal runs.

This offers a bonus to those of us who can't play the game for days on end, and lowers the ceiling on the max level. No more channels full of lvl 90's.

My point is this; maybe in WoW you'll actually go 'whoa' when you see a high lvl character.

I really didnt see too much grinding from players really in Beta. I also didnt see leveling too fast in comparison to Diablo II and it currently is quite difficult to "rush" someone. The only area which were problemental were areas such as the orc towers and vancleef (both missions which are hard) but these are balanced by the fact that most people who try the missions die very often and the expierience hasn't really changed. I'm not totally against the idea because I have not tried it yet but it seems really it wont affect me much because I gained most of my expierience from finishing missions rather than grinding. Again survival skills can really benefit from this if they make it so resting by a campfire can rest you to fully rested. Bob Leveling in this game is alot slower so no you wont reach level 20 in two days (assuming you dont sleep) and sworen I heard that the binus exp is nearly negated since they have lifted the amount of exp required to level up was increased by by about 160% of the original.

Scuz-
Have you played a real MMORPG? In a year, *nobody* will be going "whoa" at high level characters. I'd say give it a month at most from launch and you'll have a maxed level character somewhere. Blizzard could slow that down... but not by much, and at the expense of rendering their game utterly unplayable to anyone without hundreds of hours of free time all the time.

Take Dark Age of Camelot - it's been out for 2 and a half years, and I know people with 100 days /played on their main toon alone (thats 2400 hours spent actually logged in on that character). MMORPG fans play way too much and there are way too many of them, if you make it so they have trouble getting to max level, you make it so more casual players have no chance of ever attaining it. In an MMORPG, that translates into having no real reason to play.

However, Blizzard is not even getting close to the extreme you're inferring.

We still have yet to see how hard it will be to level Hero characters. From what I hear, they shall we like the Jedi in SWG.

We'll see where Blizzard takes us.

it's a timesink. Simple, annoying in the long run and totally ridiculous in so many ways. The Lineage 2 no mana potions is another classic example of it. It's a cheap way to enforce a restriction on player leveling speed. Just one more reason why WOW will be a kiddie game that simply doesn't offer the same for the money spent that most MMO's do.

Spoken like someone who isn't in beta.

Kiddie game or not, the game is addicting, and worth every penny. Their timesink only affects those people who wish to live their lives inside the game.

Which is reason enough for me to be against it. I just spent half an hour in lineage 2 discussing the very same problem there and actually had to listen to 2 guys telling me how good timesinks are.

What a bunch of crap. A timesink has one function and one function only, it eats up time making the games timespan from starting to the endgame last artificially longer. Its bad design made for the simple reason that without it a powergamer will come through to endgame in 2 months, instead of 2.5 or 3 or even 4 months. For the casual gamer it makes the endgame goals almost unreachable. If you want to see a timesink in action play Diablo 2 without healing and mana potions. Then play it only 1 hour per day and tell me how Hell Diablo was. Oh right, you will never reach him because you spend half your time waiting for mana and health to regen. It's about profits, its a despicable example of how business intervenes with solid and wellthought gamedesign, and as such I am against it.

The next step after inserting a bunch of timesinks and other obstacles to make gameplay last longer artificially is the sugarpiece of the moneymaking sheme, they will announce some fancy superhigh endlevel items, mounts, castles or whatever to strive to own and posess in the game. If the calculation works out you end up keeping some of the powergamers you just tried to stab in order to make money off them. The average 1 hour a day gamer shouldn't really even care about it since he won't reach those within the first year of the games launch anyway, and when he eventually does it will be just about as commonplace as white panties in lineage 2.


What it comes down to is a simple question, am I getting my money worth of entertainment from it. Would I be better off spending my 10-20 euro on perhaps a payTV movie channel, or something else? I can buy 1 book or even more than 1 if I buy pocket book classics for example. Does WOW or any MMO for that matter offer me something worth my money? And what exactly does a timesink do to that idea of money's worth? It's like a commercial on TV. When I watch a show, it suddenly stops, I get fed some commercials and then the show continues. That's a timesink. The budweiser commercial doesn't add anything to my West Wing experience. It simply is there to make the show last a full hour. Which is fine since I'm not paying for the time I spent watching West Wing. In a MMO however I am paying for it. There is a monthly fee. I didn't pay that fee to sit around doing nothing in a game world, I can do that perfectly well at home without having to pay Blizzard or another developer for that...

Well, you have fun being a skeptic and bitching about a system you haven't even tried yet.

I'll be enjoying World of WarCraft.

Tah.

I played for 17 hours before I started getting less than 100% experience. This is not a timesink, it's nothing like a timesink, just read what Rob Pardo said:
QUOTE
Why was Rest State added:
1) Increase some sense of realism and role playing in the game by incorporating the concept of Inns and characters sleeping
2) To try to balance the speed at which various play styles level in the game. Even though WOW has a faster level curve than many games, we found that casual players were still feeling the "grind" in later levels. We didn't want to make the level curve even easier, since many other players would zoom through the game too fast.
3) Rest State, Inns and Hearthstones do all go together. We wanted to give people some limited teleportation around the world to elevate some of the long travel complaints, we wanted to encourage people to go to towns and cities through Inns, and we wanted to balance the level curve.
4) It does give people an in-game alarm clock where each time you change a rest state, you can decide whether you want to log, continue or do other activities (trade skill, pvp, etc).
5) It reduces the pressure for every area to be perfectly balanced experiece/balance wise. For example in EQ, it was common during any level range to go to the "perfect" grinding spot. With rest states and questing, the world should stay more evenly distributed.

Reasons why it was NOT added
1) To prevent players from getting to the "end game" in X time.
We KNOW that power gamers are going to get to max level in a fraction of the time of everyone else. We KNOW that we need plenty of end game options available. We INTEND to provide these when we release the game, not buy ourselves an extra month or two to get them done.
2) To force people to sit in Inns.
We intend just for people to log out at Inns naturally at the end of their play session. You can only rest online at Inns so that you don't accidentally log a character on that isn't rested and then lose your "rested" time. Also, for some people it does give them the change to chat and roleplay while "resting". We have also given some thought to let you "rest" while in cities.

Having finally finished downloading the upgrade (Durn Mothers-in-Law). I am loving it. I don't mind the Rest system, as I only get a few hours a day to play.

Its a decent idea to impliment into the game, but I see where and why people dislike it.

I would like to add that it looks like Blizzard finally took my complaints (and maybe a few others) and added an unarmed weapons catagory. I have yet to find out what it does, as it requires 50 skill points, but my Night Elf Druid intends to find out.

And Deathwing, could you pm me about how I post my journal?

I'm a casual gamer, so i think the rest system is really, really cool. I've played Lin II for the past week powergaming, so i've a level 20, but the real problem with lin2 is not the mana potions, it's the simple fact that the game IS grind. you need a definition of grind? try getting to a level past 17 in lineage. Boring.

Anyway, in WoW, the rest system means several things:
1) people will bother crafting. What else do they have to do if they want to stay on the same char? Fight all day, then go home and craft, then logoff for 8 hours. If you really want to powergame, just level for 8 hours, logoff for 8, then level for 8 again, and you get max experience, pretty much.
2) Inns will actually be used.
In EQ, did you see people in inns? Ever? In any game, has there ever been a point to going into an inn? No. The WoW rest system means that inns will be popluated with people resting, checking in, teleporting in from a long day, etc. All with stories to tell.
3) People may (if they choose) actually get some sleep
I understand the urge in a game to level level level forever, but with this, if you sleep for 8 hours, you're actualy gaining a bonus in the long run.

I dunno. I like it.
