It didn't take long for me to notice that something was different when in the middle of nowhere, stood a teleporting Ogre. Name? GM, Game Master, a Blizzard Employee.

Nearby, Chickens Stumbled about, with player names on the heads... nope, not a usual day!

This was the day where Chikens would invade azeroth, or rathr, everyone who walked up to a teleporting Ogre Mage would automatically be transformed into one.

Down the streets of Goldshire, Chickens were having Cock Fights, Chickens were Dancing, and Chickens were questing, killing Gnolls and Bandits.

While hardly aserious event, this demonstrats that in MMORPG, world events can happen, and happen easily. Blizzard will plan to have one World Event each month once World of Warcraft released, and we can't wait to see what they can do.

I the meantime, I've got quite a few screenshots for my adventures of a chicken.

Aww man! Sucks that I missed it. :(
All I saw was an all-pink dead body of an ogre much later on. :)
