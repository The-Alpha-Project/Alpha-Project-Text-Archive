As the description said, IronForge was the most boring place ever. Why? It's SO BIG! And me, only being level 10, didn't have an easy way around. So, needless to say, I had to walk everywhere. Probably 95% of my time was spent running from one side of Dun Morogh to the other. :\

Anyway, there was a quest that I needed to complete which I got from some dude in Stormwind. He said I should take the Gryphon up and deliver this package to this guy in the very north of Loch Modan, which is a good 15 minutes' straight run from Iron Forge. But everyone knows it's not STRAIGHT... you had battles and such. So all in all... 30-35 minutes of walking. :(

Once I got there, he gave me my 5 silver pieces and 1800 experience (enough for a level) and gave me a letter to give back to the guy in Stormwind! I was ready to smack him! I'm some kind of bitch for two love sick dwarves! AHHH! Anyway, I accepted because there was nothing else to do than go back to Stormwind (because Loch Modan is so damned empty). So I trucked it back to Iron Forge (died once in the process) and hopped aboard a Gryphon back. The Gryphon ride is a really nice scenic overlook, but the lag makes it tough and the minute details aren't really able to be seen (as seen in picture Gryphon 3). It's so awesome though. ;) Got back to Stormwind, hopped off a cliff into the lake for fun and took a screenshot of me swimming.

All in all, wasted night, but meh; I had fun. ^_^

Gryphon1
Gryphon2
Gryphon3
Gryphon4
Gryphon5
Steam Tank
A dip in the lake

And with that, I'm calling it a night. :)

Edit: Yeah and a lot of you people are asking what guild I'm in. Kali Compton (Yes, GFraizer's. ;) )

Black Rock Spire is in Azeroth, in the Red Ridge Mountains (East of Northshire Abbey).
