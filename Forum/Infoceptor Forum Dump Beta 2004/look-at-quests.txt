I'd like to voice some opinions about quests at the moment.

World of Warcraft is a very quest focused game, as you're probably aware. That is to say, for the lower levels, 70% of your experience will come from completing quests. The quests themselves to make the game a par above other MMORPGS. It's much more fun to hack at monsters when you've got an objective, then to just hack at monsters. You get this sense of progression... if when you're not leveling up. You don't get that in Everquest.

The only complaint I have is that currently some quests become quite frustrating when there's too many people in the game world. For instance, a good number of the quests involve killing a certain number of some creature, or taking x items for said creature. When there's too many players, you'll find everyone just sitting there, waiting for extra monsters to spawn. Every monster is then hacked to bits promptedly, and the camping begins again.

The second is that some monsters, such as Bosses, are unique. While the party system does help so that anyone in the same party gets credit for killing the beast, there are always some high levels players around, who've already completely the quest, are just camping there for fun. A good example of this is Goldtooth, a Gnoll Boss. During the day, you'll really need to wait around the kill the dude.

This is problem that's there for all RPGs, and so how do we go around it?

I would recommend that Quest Bosses should to invisible to people who've completed the quest that requires them to kill it, and monster respawn rate was adjusted depending on the number of people in the area.

These I will forward to Blizzard.

That is not to say though, that all quests involve a monotonous wait. Most are extremely fun!

Consider the Quest System in WOW similar to that of Morrowind, except that you can meet random players along the way! In addition, the game is better paces, and its easier to get from place to place!

All in all, with a few tweaks, Quests should give focus to WOW that most MMORPGs lack, and that focus should make it all more fun than just an EXP grind.

Excellent. If the game is a massively multiplayer Morrowind, with a bit more humour, I'll be hooked.

If it's better...

Well then, lets not wish that upon me.

Funny Andwarf, I have been thinking the same for a month or so already. Too much of this game will not be a good thing for me hehe.

The quests sound infinitely better then the ones for Everquest. Now I have never played it myself, so I'm only going with second hand accounts. They sounded as much fun as if you were getting a root canal instead of playing a game for enjoyment.

i haven't had any negative experiences where other players are involved with questing yet. only positive.
one time i completed a quest from an NPC (Princess must die!) just as someone else (a girl from sweden) was talking to the NPC. i asked if she got the quest i'd just completed and what else she was working on. she had gotten the same quest i just completed and had accepted one i needed to complete as well from another NPC. so i grouped with her to help her complete the Princess quest in agreement that we'd go do the next one together. while arriving at Princess, there were about 4 others completing it. death blows being dealt just as we walked up. so we had to wait for a respawn. then about three others showed up and asked if we would all group to all get credit. so we did and everyone who needed the collar from Princess (a big boar, by the way) got it.
the swedish girl (a priest) and i (a mage) then proceeded to head to this mine we needed to explore just as a mighty paladin is running up to it. so now there were 3 and we head into the mine. just a scouting job, so when we got to the spiders inside and completed it, we ran out and disbanded. the priest had to go get credit for killing the pig and the paladin wanted to get the same quest. wouldn't surprise me if the priest went with the paladin to give him a hand.
there's this one quest which i was finding pretty hard. it's tough getting used to monsters who attack unprovoked who are 2 levels higher than you. finally i met up with a paladin on the same quest who wanted my help with it. while working on this quest of beating a few level 9 creatures and gathering their armbands, there's this level 13 guy that pops up once in awhile. so i ask what the deal with him is. my new partner tells me you get the quest for him by reading the WANTED POSTER right by the npc who sent me on the current quest. i'd never even though of that. so we run off so i can get that quest so we can both get credit when we kill him. by the time he respawns, there's 5 others around and the group becomes 7. i got a sweet staff as reward for that one. something like 22-30 damage. without that other player, i'd have never even thought to look at the wanted poster that i'd just casually strolled past.
