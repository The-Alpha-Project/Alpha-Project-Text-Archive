As soon as Deathwing sets up my Main Page upload, I'll have the ability to post massive amounts of screenies. I have a few REALLY cool ones lined up so I can't wait to post them when DW does set it up.

But for now, please post all your Screenshot requests here. What do you want to see? What seems really cool? Obscure features not yet posted anywhere? Whatever you want (in reason :p). Post 'em!

I'd like to see some scenic sites, the ones people are talking about... and I'd like to see the new world tree. And stuff like lothar's final battle and epic areas, i wanna see what they look like.

I wouldn't mind seeing some famous characters either.

I'd love to see a screenshot of your paper doll and all your equipment and your stats and skills. :) Or any other super powerful weapons/equipment you've found, or seen for sale or something.

IRONFORGE.

Please. Just make a dwarf and show me the mountains of ironforge for a while, then I'll be a happy man.

Oh, and a picture of a map showing all the area you can explore would be good.

I've been up all night playing...so the screenies are unsorted and unnamed, but they are worth nabbing. Sorry about the massive zip file size 56kers.

When I wake up I'll sort them all out, upload them, and shrink'em. For now, enjoy the links.

Screenies

*collapses into bed*

Argh...you wanted character screens...BLARGHLE!!!!

Character Screenies

Again...sorry bout the size.

Can anyone get pictures of Blackrock Spire?

[EDIT] Oh yeah, and I don't need any pictures of Ironforge now, cause IGN noticed the total kickassery of Dwarves and have about 192304809257039275 Ironforge sceenshots. Looks TONS cooler than Teldrassil :) mumblemumblenightelffaggotrymumblemumble

Can anyone get pictures of Duskwood? Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease?

Oh yeah, and HOLY CRAP, Spidy, that screenie download is taking THREE HOURS @_@

Here's one of my favorite abilities in action. And it's right outside of Stormwind. ^_^

(IMG:http://www.infoceptor.com/wow/gallery/albums/album06/gnomestormwind.jpg)

Getting a level up screen will be really hard. You only level up once an hour / two hours and it's rather quick. :\ I'll try, but don't expect anything.

I uploaded 5 screenshots. Expect more today.

Wow, awesome shots. D'you think you could get one of Blackrock Spire?

To be honest, I wouldn't be suprised if those were the only options in graphics. They seem adjustable enough. The game looks awesome, even though you've got some of the sliders on low :)

[EDIT]D'you think you could possibly turn all the settings to high, take a screenie, then put them back to normal and take a screenie, for comparisons between the two? Thanks again,

That's default. You can't move anything but the resolution.
