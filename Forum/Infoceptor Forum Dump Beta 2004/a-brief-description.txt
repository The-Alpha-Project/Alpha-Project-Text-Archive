Just to let you all know, there is a lot to be said about WoW, so forgive me if I don't cover everything.

My journey began deep in the NE forests; ShadowGlen more specifically. I chose the rogue class, as it is my favorite. Upon starting, I was immediately assigned a quest, and proceeded to begin my adverturing.

The nice part about that was the fact that the game spared no time in throwing a good number of quests at you, and all were in close vicinity of eachother. This prevents you from running around the entire forest and getting lost; instead it forces you to learn the area, and as it gives you more and more quests, the ground they cover spreads out gradually. You'll find yourself traveling on familiar ground a lot, but I personally never found this to be tedious, because by the time I learned the area pretty well, a new quest had me running into parts of the forest I hadn't visited yet.

I like the system of leveling Blizzard has implemented. While it still holds itself to the tried and true hack and slash style of gameplay, it adds more to it. Depending on where you spend skill points, you can train in cooking, fishing, skinning, blacksmithing, leatherwork and so on. Each level up is significant, but it doesn't stop there. Once you level, your skill levels' cap is raised, so you need to use said skills/talents in order for them to improve. By the time your experience bar reaches 50% to the next level, all of your active skills are usually maxed again. Should you choose to take on a new skill, you will need to level it from scratch; just because you're level 30 and you decide to take up tailoring, will in no way make you better than a level 15 who's taken the time to master the skill. Everything takes effort in this game; I love it.

The game keeps you busy with quests, which are a great way to gain experience; they make experience gained through mindless slaughter look pathetic. (Early on at least, I haven't seen this disproven yet, although once you hit level 10 or so, the experience awarded by quests isn't so mind-boggling anymore) The sheer mass and variety of quests will certainly keep you busy; more often than not you don't even notice your exp bar fill up as you progress.

Anywho, back to my travels. So I progressed all throughout the forest performing all sorts of quests, getting betrayed by a group I joined, and dying...a lot as a result. Intersting idea on dying too. You can either lay there waiting for a resurrection from a friendly priest (you have a 5 minute limit) or choose to leave your body. Your spirit then travels to the last runestone you were near (at least with NE) and you can either speak to the spirit healer to get your body back (at the cost of exp) or you can run back to your body and receive no penalty. There is a catch however; while as a ghost you have increased speed, and improved invisibility, (as well as being invulnerable...you're dead, duh) you cannot do ANYTHING. You cannot talk (save party/tell/global chat) or look at any quest logs, inventory; nothing. In fact, when you're a ghost, you cannot even see 90% of the players/NPCs. That includes the ones around your body, so you need to be careful when you get within proximity to re-enter your corpse. Once you choose to do so, you come back in the game with almost no health, and enemies can see you again. A nice feature about being a ghost is that you can explore the areas indefinately, but you get no exploration bonuses if you choose to do so. Still, it's nice to get a layout of the area if you just died in an unfamiliar place.

I've traveled outside the forests since, mainly Darkshore. I can choose to take a boat to Stormwind (I think) but I haven't nearly finished all the quests in the area. I finished off a few quests, and upon reaching level 12, I've taken up some new rogue skills (such as sap, eviscerate level 2, and so on) as well as Leathercraft and skinning; both of which I'm mastering back in the forest. (Easy to kill mobs, most of which can be skinned) I've taken up dual daggers as my weapons/style, and I'll work from there. I honestly have no real direction at the moment except to get some more quests done and master my skills. Once I do that, I can plan ahead for my character's development.

My most memorable moment up to this point?

One of the last NE quests has you pitted against a whole clan of corrupted furbolgs. You need to slaughter Ursal; their leader. This was a quest designed for a group of players, as you have to slaughter your way through a few camps full of furbolgs just to be able to reach Ursal. And he has all kinds of furbolgs in his clan, from shamans, to spellcasters, to fighters. However, no one in the area wanted to group, so I decided, being the rogue I am, to use stealth. I found a back trail that led around all the camps, straight to Ursal's. The trail led to a small cliff that overlooked the camp, so once I jumped down, I wouldn't be able to go back. Regardless of that fact, I dropped down, and from there I lured the few furbolgs near him to attack me while he strolled on his patrol route. After dispatching the spellcaster and two fighters, I lured him into the same trap. We were both equal level, (12) but I ended up slaughtering him anyway; my combos turned him into nothing more than a bloody piece of meat. Pity I couldn't skin him; I would have loved to keep his hide as a souvenir.

Once he was dead, there was the matter of getting out. I couldn't go back up the cliff, so it was either fighting my way out, (no way) running through as fast as I could (suicide) or using shadowmeld and creeping through all the camps to escape. (ding!)

Needless to say, I got out completely undetected, and promptly collected my reward.

True to the code of the rogue. ^_^

My second most memorable moment?

Watching female night elf characters tear off their clothes and dance scantily clad in the middle of town square.

(They think I'm kidding...)

*cough*

On that note...


That's all for now...stay tuned! I'll post more of my travels later on.


Opinion so far: "Where is the pre-order button?"

What happens on the boat trips? Do you get to run around the boat or do you just see a short cutscene then arrive on the other side or what?

Currently there is no boat cinematic, it's not implemented yet, so instead you get a free teleport over into the designated town.

YOu're not getting alot of replies cuz it's on the main page. :p

I'm greatly jealous that you got the beta. Hopefully I'll be able to enjoy it in one of the later waves of releases. So far it sounds great. How exactly do the combos work? and some screenies of them in action and the inventory system would be cool as well.

Wow (non-acronym), I really want a rogue character now. The sneakiness of it is cool. And with the back path and cliff you can tell Blizzard wants you to explore every course in a quest. That is so awesome on so many levels.

Love your sig picture Cain, by the way.
