Sadly I don't have enough time in my day to play on a steady basis, but once my work gets done, that'll change.

Anywho, onto my adventures. Surprisingly, I'm still centered in Darkshore. I haven't even moved on to Ashenvale, as that requires you to be at least 18+ level, and I'm only 16 at the moment. Currently I'm saving up my skill points to be able to master leatherworking, and then master skinning later on. It will take me another 3-4 levels before I can master either one, and another 7 levels to finish off the remaining one. That will leave me at level 27ish...a loooooong way to go. Once those are completed I think I might invest in survival, or perhaps first aid. I'm unsure at this point.

My skills are already paying off; the leather items I create I put out on the market, and to my surprise people gobble it up. To me it seems like just another item, but then I realize the amount of micromanagement I'm putting into getting the materials just to make these items, and the price jack that the NPC stores put in place, not to mention the small buffs I can implement into pretty much anything made of leather that I come across. "My leather is just better." Msg Spider ingame if you're in need of my quality work. Provide the materials, and you get your items at no cost! *shameless plug* :)

The fact that you can find recipies for items that aren't usually around can give you a huge advantage in the market as well. If no one in the area can make a certain item, and you know that people want it; ding ding ding! Suddenly you have a wonderful business opportunity. You can always get the basic recipes from the trainers, but it's always a good idea to spend that small fortune on a rare item recipe.

Which brings me to another aspect of trading. Blizzard has enabled item stats in speech. If you have an item, you can press ctrl + left click (I believe it's ctrl, if not, it's shift) and it appears in your speech. For example, let's say you want to sell a leather vest that is 28 armor, with +1 agility and +1 spirit. Type your trade message, and when you want to declare your item ctrl+left-click on it. It appears as [Leather Vest]. When you annouce it over the channel, anyone can left click on the item and see it's stats. This way you know the person has the item, and if you're totally unfamiliar with it you don't need to ask around, you can click and see for yourself. A very good idea; it certainly helps trade take place over large distances, as you don't need to meet the person to see the stats the item has. But to trade you do of course.

Where else have I gone? Well, while I can't really hang around Ashenvale, I have been there, but the undead scouring the lands somewhat put me off from visiting more often. I've taken the warp to Menethil Harbor (boat isn't implemented yet) and that's a pretty interesting town. Mostly humans and their ilk, but it's still a pretty high level area. (20+) I just ran a few errands I had received from Darkshore, and traded in some higher level goods to help me out back in my questing area. I scored myself a Relic Blade, which is currently just a notch or two under the best dagger in the game. And a later high level quest promises to reward me with another one. :D

Good times good times.

As far as questing goes...

Each area takes a considerable amount of time to complete; I still have 5 quests that need wrapping up; yet the more objectives I complete, the more I receive. The "solo" aspect of the game is also dissipating quickly; as more and more quests are requiring me to group with people. You may think it's because I don't level enough, but that's entirely not it. Mobs I can kill on my own give me almost no experience anymore, and mobs that can give me experience, are so tough that only the best equipment would enable me to tackle them alone. Not to mention the quests given to me throw me into scenarios where a 6 person group is needed, with some level of coordination between us all. If we don't balance ourselves out, we get slaughtered. An all melee group sounds nice, but while that may work when going against 1 or 2 mobs, if we get swarmed (which happens quite often) we're pretty much doomed. No in-battle healing usually means a quick death. Potions can't really work either, as they have a cooldown; you can only chug a potion every so often. Constant need for groups means more people interaction; reputation will eventually play an important role when progressing through the game.

Any current gripes?

Mmm, the walking bit is quite annoying I have to admit. Not so much when it comes to everyday travel, but when you die. That long haul to get back to your corpse can be maddening sometimes; a worse penalty than any exp hit if you think about it. While you can take the exp hit, 95% of the time it's not worth your while to sacrifice a quest's worth of experience just to save yourself the walk. More often than not you need to go back to the area you died in for a quest; so you're better off just making the ghost run. It turns really nasty when you die surrounded my enemies; you'll end up making a few trips just to get back to your corpse. It takes me about 5 minutes of straight travel just to get back to my corpse in my current area. Now imagine dying a few consecutive times while trying to escape. Yeah. Ouch.

It's also detrimental to a group; especially if it isn't balanced (aka, all melee, no priest/mage/warlock). If you die in battle and need to walk for 5 minutes to get back to your corpse you become a huge hinderance upon the group, not to mention potentially being the cause of their downfall as they now lack your support in battle.

What does this mean?

Plan ahead, organize, and don't take unecessary risks unless you're prepared to suffer the consequences. It also means people can't just leap straight into battle after resurrecting. Even if a priest resurrects you, you'll suffer resurrection sickness for 5 minutes. (It is a huge drain on all your stats)

While it's a pain to deal with, I hope Blizzard doesn't change it. We don't need another EverQuest.

While some of you may have noticed people complaining about travel times in WoW, (beta boards) I personally don't see them as an issue. The fact that you can't warp anywhere (Unless you get 3 warlocks to summon you) keeps the size of the world alive. It's always a factor in anything you do. Very good choice in my opinion, may it never change. The only thing I'd like to be able to do is enjoy connecting flights if traveling between a few areas, although if it's not implemented I won't mind.

The horde shall be implemented soon, along with some new classes for the night elves, so that looks to be interesting. I personally would like to try a Troll shaman if I get the chance. For now though, I'll keep playing my rogue, who I've grown rather attached to.

Current opinion: "Where is the pre-order button already!? I thought the patch would fix it!"

troll shaman is pretty cool. when i got in on the alpha, the tri-horde push was happening. funny thing is that those were the 3 races i had the least interest in playing. but the troll shaman turned out to be pretty fun. some non-combat quests i went on that made me feel, for lack of a better term, special. like blizzard really captured some kind of magic and put it into this game. i went on a spirit walk and drank this septa that was concocted for me and saw some earth spirit and he told me what it meant to be connected to the earth. strength of the mountains and patience of the plains, etc. i could allmost see myself playing shaman permanently. but then they went all alliance push on me and i've been human mage since. just hit level 11 tonight. haven't been playing nearly as much as i want, but i have 3 days off in a row. i'll definately get some hours in over the next few days.

Currently it's level 30, but come final release it will hit level 60. I'm not sure when/how they plan on raising the cap in the beta.

Phase 2 should raise to 35 or 40.
