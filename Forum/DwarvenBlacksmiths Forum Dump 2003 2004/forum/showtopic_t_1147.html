<br/>

<br/>
ok here it is: 
<br/>

<br/>
For a time unknown by even the eldest upon the lands, Melkor had walked upon the earth. He was many things but among them he was a follower of the light, a bringer of the peace to all that lived. Melkor had once turned to evil for comfort for they were the only ones who truly understood the paths he must walk, but when he faced the ancient evil of the lands he realized what the world and the light meant to him and turned on the evil of the land and triumphed. 
<br/>

<br/>
Now Melkor roams the plains looking for an answer, the answer he has always sought. He was looking for the answer to his destiny, he was looking for a reason the light had imbued him with eternal life. Melkor has been known to many as many things but to himself, he was known as.. dragon lord for he was the spawn of darkness itself he was the offspring of the king of black dragons he was son to....Deathwing. He had once been able to morph to a great black dragon a dragon so great he could even match the mighty Deathwing himself. But that power had not been used for many a century for when he became the black dragon he also became crazed, the powers given to him were so great they drove him insane with its magic. He had survived the wars of old and triumphed over great evil, but for what he wondered. He must have a purpose to live, to keep him from turning to evil. That day he (after a great amount of thought) decided to go to Stormwind to offer his services to great lands of its reign..... 
<br/>

<br/>
The wind chilled him to the very bone as he huddled in what little shelter he had. Even he the great Melkor felt weakened by the blizzard gusting all around him and he wondered wether he should have not gone in the winter months but there was no turning back now with the great blizzard behind him almost daring him to go back but it was the 5th day of his journey to Stormwind and he was only a few days walk away now. The cave Melkor had huddled in was small and provided little shelter against the gail force winds buffeting him from all directions it seemed. This has gone on to long he though it was time for this god forsaken blizzard to end. After another 5 hours the blizzard died down enough for him to walk. He got out of the cave and slung his sack with what was left of his provisions over his shoulder and picked up his mighty war hammer called Sigurd and headed out into the snow storm. As he heaved his way through the thick snow and battering wind he thought of his father and wondered were he was at this moment or even if he remembered him. Then he heard a mighty battle cry and then another but this one sounded less human more.....demon. 
<br/>

<br/>
Forgetting the storm and the wind and even his sack he silently went to the sounds of the battle cries. Now he heard a clanging like the sound of sword against sword. Now he ran to a nearby croius tree and then another hoping to stay unseen until he saw friend from foe. Then he saw a glint of armor and then the whole battle seen upon which he saw 2 warriors with their mighty swords and shields drawn and another who had much more fanciful armor and was much shorter and stockier and wore the mark of a captain who although Melkor did not know it yet was a paladin like himself. Then he saw what they were fighting. 4 giant demons with blood red skin and icy blue eyes and stood a good 3 meter's tall and in there gnarled hands they held scimitars enriched with gemstones that were obviously imbued there magically . The odds were against the humans and the dwarf but they fought with more courage and valor. The time has come thought Melkor for me to show were my alliances truly stand, and with that thought he shouted a mighty battle cry which could not be sounded by and human throat. 
<br/>

<br/>
As he charged into battle he raised his great war hammer Sigurd and with his battle cry distracting both parties he swung with all the might his human body would allow him and his gleaming war hammer swung with great speed and might hit the nearest demon in the left should with such force the demons shoulder tore off and sent the the beast flying through the air and crashing into a bigger of the three who looked to be the leader of the pack demons. The big one let out a roar and hurled his companion away from him then with that raising his scimitar ran towards Melkor but by the time the 2 humans and dwarf had realized what was happening and rushed to Melkors aid, The 2 warriors raised their shields and defended Melkor from the demons mighty blow and then the two engaged the demon in combat. Looking at the dwarfen captain Melkor said " will you help me defeat the servants of the hell fire?' and the hearty dwarf looked at him as if he were asking a stupid question and answered "Ok I'll take the 3rd demon and you take the armless bugger" 
<br/>

<br/>
Then with the warriors of the alliance in combat with the demons of hell Melkor rushed to meet his armless opponent and to finish him off but then he saw the demon doing arcane movements with his hands. Knowing the demon was casting a spell and also he would not reach him in time Melkor seized all his might and hurled Sigurd with the fury of the dragon within him and the hammer whirled towards the demons face but the demon saw this just in time to raise a arm in defense but his move was to late and the hammer took off his arm as if it was mere butter and then slammed into his head with the force of a bolt from the lighting god and decapitated the demon with ease. The headless demon fell motion less to the ground, seeing this Melkor walked towards the demon and picked up his trusted war hammer and went to join the stocky dwarf in battle with the 3rd demon. He looked at the 2 warriors, one had taken a hit in the shoulder and the other was limping seeing the situation Melkor went to help but then the limping one raised his might sword and clean sliced the demons head off. Then he felt a sharp pain searing in his shoulder and saw a mean looking throwing knife imbedded in his shoulder. Seething with anger at the demon Melkor ignored the pain in his shoulder and picked up the leader of the demons scimitar and dropping his own war hammer in favor of the enchanted blade rushed to the aid of the dwarf. The dwarf was fighting courageously against the last remaining demon and had succeeded in seriously injuring the demon for the demon was gushing its blood from a wound in its chest. The demon, he and the dwarf exchanged blows and the dwarf took a mighty swing which would have killed the demon but the demon dodged just in time and taking advantage of the off balance dwarf swung his scimitar aim for exposed neck... 
<br/>

<br/>
Melkor himself being off balance saw no means to save the dwarf but then remember an old spell the paladin of the 1st war used to use it was a spell with completely healed any person but also severely drained the paladin. He just finished the arcane movements of the spell when the blade was wrenched from the dwarfs limp body. Just at that moment the great Melkor collapsed from the exhaustion of the spell. 
<br/>

<br/>
Melkor heard a strong voice talking, he decided to pretend to still be unconscious and heard a voice "Aye he will make a good guardian u should of seen the way he used that war hammer of his, is was like a whirl wind, wish I new who he was and how he saved me with that spell though." Then another voice answered "Yes but he will only be a Guardian of Stormwind if that is his wish." 
<br/>

<br/>
So that is who I am to be then that is the path I will take, I will be a Guardian of Stormwind though Melkor before slipping into unconsciousness with a slight smile on his face one which had not been seen for millennia 
<br/>
