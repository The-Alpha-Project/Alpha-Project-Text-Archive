<br/>
Age: 160
<br/>

<br/>
When he was about 30, he had finally mastered two daggers, and how to make them poisoniss as they come. He wore a dark green cloak and light black chain mail. He hid his daggers in small pouches in his cloak, as he walked around the orcish camp. He thought about all the gnomes, his past, how he was abused back then, how he is disrespected by the orc, how tired of it is he getting of it all. A grunt walks in front of him. 
<br/>

<br/>
"You stupid gnome, get out of here, you do not-" And was cut off by four daggers into his chest and one into his throat. Sam picked them up and wiped it off on the orcs skin, and an exra cloth in his cloak. He put his daggers away and slid by into the warcheifs tent.
<br/>

<br/>
"im tired of this disrepsect your men give me, im done, and so are you" and with that, the gnome threw eight daggers at the orcs legs. They stuck into his leg from necap up, disabling him.
<br/>

<br/>
"pity, you were an ok fighter, you abusive jack ass" and he throws the finishing dagger into the warcheifs throat. He grabbed his daggers and regrabed his cloth and wiped it all off. He puts away his daggers and spits on the corpse, and runs swiftly enough for nobody to notice it all. He runs swiftly towards the mountains. Why dont i just go hang out with the dwarfs for the time being, until i can seem to get my head refigured out... And he just took off into the sunset, not stopping for anything. He was heading the wrong way he figured once he ran into a graveyard and saw a few skeletons run by. Great.... How can you get mixed up with snow and dead.. things?!?! oh well mind as well see if i can get any artifacts while im here... Sam stealthily ran ahead, blended with the walls as if he was a shadow. He ran into this huge building. He read: Treasury, Begone or your soul will be tortured!!! Wow thats a long sign. He ran in and bursted through the door. Eight skeletons turned around, fully armored and equiped with weapons. Sam ran to the right throwing daggers left and right at the skeletons. Piercing the bones on the skeletons. The legs, the thighs, the arms. They didnt care, they kept on charging. They got to close to him. The first skeleton swung his two handed sword in a downword motion, and sam slid to the right, and right into the hands of another skeleton. Before etheir of them could react another skeleton that was armed with two short swords stabbed inword. Sam ducked and the skeleton stabbed his friend. Sam threw his daggers into the face of the skeleton, breaking the bones so he was headless. He ran again and swooped down and grabbed all his daggers. He put them away and ran up the wall and pushed off to the next floor. He reached and barley grabbed on with one hand. He held on, looking around. He saw a fireball fly at him so he pushed off with his legs, a few feet passed the skeletons. He saw a human mage, possibly undead, but he had skin. Sam charged at him, swooped left to avoid the mages swing of his staff and stabbed him three times in the back with his poisoniss daggers. He ran back and kicked him in the back of the legs. The mage was stunned temporarily. The mage stopped all movment suddenly, and started screaming in agony. He was chocking, grasping his neck, and then suddenly seased all movment once more. The skeletons fell to the floor, bones and all. He kept walking forword, while wiping his daggers off. He found the vault, but didnt know how to access it. It had magical incantations on it. He ran back and grabbed the mages staff, ran forword and cracked the mages staff on the vault. The orb ontop of the staff exploded into magical energys, exploding the vault gate open. Great, now i only have a few minutes to grab and run. He ran in and saw a mask and a golden dagger with gems in it. It was inchanted, he could sense it. He grabbed the mask and dagger, shoved the mask into his cloak pocket and put poison on his dagger and switched it with his left dagger. He ran outside, where three undead beings were waiting, with smitars. He ran up and stabbed two of them in the neck, as the third serounded Sam and swung at him with his smitars. The one that was stabbed with the inchanted dagger screamed wildley, then was suddenly gone, only cloth was left. Sam then threw the dagger at the undead being behind him, hitting him in the stumach. The same thing happened to him, as he grabbed the dagger and stabbed the last undead being in the chest. He hid his daggers and ran as fast he could. Out of the graveyard he ran. He started running in the opposite direction, hoping he was finally heading in the right direction.
<br/>

<br/>
"damn undead, you all diserve to burn in the abyss!" Sam mumbled as he trudged on forword, glaring at his new dagger, at the power it held that he hadnt seem to uncover, besides the fact that the undead seem to yell in agony and basicly desinigrate.<br/>_________________<br/>The morons do the stupidest things, but who is the true moron, the judger or the moron himself?

<br/>

<br/>
Sam was only two when his town was attacked. His father, a blacksmith had some skill in dealing with weapons. His mom was an engineer, who helped create towers and buildings, so she had some skill in using a hammer. His mom took up a war hammer and his father a saber and they only had leather armor, leggings, gloves, and armor. They hid Sam in an underground house, where the rest of the kids were hidden while the orcs cracked down on their gates. They all lined up, as the eight gunners ran up the ladders into two towers, which were behind the gate. The orc finally blasted through, and they charged head on to the gnomes. Sam's father fought in the front, along side his mother. They slaughtered a few orcs as they charged. Out of no where four hatches flew and struck Sam's father in the chest. 
<br/>
He whispered, "My son..." as he went to the floor, dead. His mother cried and started swinging violently. She went to, died as she cracked a few orcs with her war hammer. 
<br/>
She fell, and whispered," the children..." and died in the floor. The rest of the gnomes put up a grand fight, but their fall was inevitable. The village&#8217;s valuables were stolen, and then was set fire. They left as the city was ablaze, like a dragon swooped down and burned down the city. The oldest child (the age of 12) kicked open the little hole. He popped his head out and saw the village burned down to ashes. He sniffed, then controled himself to make him look the unemotional one. He led the others out and they started traveling west... 
<br/>

<br/>
Eight years later they made another small village, only two houses though. Each house had 6 rooms and a kitchen area. They were all outside, on this bright day playing tag when a orcish warrior, smothered in blood wandered into there camp. The oldest ran in and grabbed two daggers he had gotten from the field eight years ago... He tossed one to Sam, knowing he is the second oldest and that he would be of some use. The rest of the children ran back towards the house as the pair walked forword... The grunt smiled and colapsed because of exhaustion. Later that night Sam and the oldest one was watching over the grunt, rolled up in a blanket they had provided. They put him in front of the fire. Sam helped put a few deers onto the huge fire. They watched the orc closer this time, waiting for him to wake. At last he did, he opened his eyes and sat up. He looked at himself, not covered with blood anymore. He smelled the food roasting and watched it. Then turned to watch the pair of gnomes. 
<br/>
"Uh thanks...." said the grunt. He didnt think he would be saved, he thought he would of died because gnomes generally hate orcs. 
<br/>
"No problem... So are you a scout?" asked Sam, wondering why he had been so tatered up, possibly from running. 
<br/>
"No, a warrior actually... We were cought up in a battle with elves. We were loosing, down to four of us and ten of them. We all started to flee, throwing our shields to our backs, of corse if I had one I would of too." said the orc, staring into the fire, wondering how his friends were doing. 
<br/>
"And your weapons... There not normal for an orc like yourself. Orc warriors usually are armed with shields and an axe. You have a saber. Why is that so?" asked the oldest, curious to see what his responce was. 
<br/>
"I specialize in using the saber actually, much more than i do with an axe. Daggers too, and yeah it is odd, my friends were armed with axes... Except for one, he had claws on each fist, which knocked down a few elves..." said the orcs as he started to get quieter as he went on. 
<br/>
"You think you could teach us both? I mean we kind of did just save you there..." said Sam, wanting to learn how to use a saber and a dagger. 
<br/>
"I suppose, since you did save me and all..." said the orc, actually happy that the offer was made. 
<br/>
"And your name?" asked Sam, wondering if its orcish or normal. 
<br/>
"As humans call me, its Sturm." said Sturm, quietly though, as if he was ashamed of the name. 
<br/>

<br/>
Nine years later Sam was outside practicing the moves that was showed to him by Sturm. Sturm had shown him how to use a saber, and two daggers. Sam was proud of the skills he had learned from his friend. He loved his new skills, so much that he practiced them every day. He learned how to thrown them as well, enabling him to hunt by throwing daggers. He was able to throw three at the time, placing them in each of his finger tips and throwing them. He wanted to master everything he was tought, and explore to learn other skills that he may use. As he was cracking away at wooden logs, he heard a noise. There were huge hoof stomps, like a stamped of horses stomping on the ground. 
<br/>
"Tauren!!" shouted Sturm, as he ran back into his personal house, and ran back out with a saber and a slightly longer dagger. Sturm readied himself as two tauren charged out and towards him. 
<br/>
"Get everyone and run!" shouted Sturm, as he and Leo (the oldest gnome) charged towards the tauren. They both had to be more agile if they wished to survive, as trying to block there attacks with there weapons was no use, the tauren are much stronger creatures. Sam rallied everyone and started to head south. 
<br/>
"Keep heading south, ill be back in about twenty minutes..." said Sam, charging back north, towards the battle. Meanwhile, Leo was killed by a devistating blow by the left tauren. The tauren wasnt unscratched of corse, he had two daggers in the one ankle and three in his left arm. The tauren still fought on, as he turned and started limping towards his friend to help kill Sturm. Sturm quickly realised that this was going to be harder than he thought. Sturm dodged an attack and ran behind him, stabbing inword with his saber, then undoing it and running towards the other tauren. The tauren shouted in pain, as he felt the saber go in and out of his leg. The other tauren took up his weapon and swung down. Sturm jumped out of the way and slid in the grass. He stopped himself and threw a dagger at the taurens neck. It grazed him and flew by. The tauren shouted at the top of his lungs. He was angry because he was almost killed because of his foolishness. Sturm quickly jumped back a few feet and threw four daggers at the taurens neck. The tauren had a slow reaction and turned to see a dagger plunge into his eye. The other three stabbed him in the neck. The tauren shouted, as he dropped his weapon and dropped dead. Sturm turned to see the taurens weapon swing down and crack through his skull. Sturm was killed in the one swing. Sam came up and saw what had happened. He was angry, he ran as fast as he could, throwing three daggers as he charged at the tauren. He ran to his side and threw another three daggers onto the tauren. The tauren shouted, and kept going in circles, looking for the assaulting gnome. Sam jumped up to the nearest branch and then leaped again to the middle branch. Sam threw eight daggers at the tauren, only one striking the taurens right arm. The tauren was temporarily dazed by the pain inflicted on such a small dagger. Sam leaped and stabbed down with his saber through the skull of the tauren. Sam yanked it out and jumped off. Sam grabbed Sturms old saber and casing. He put it on his belt and sheathed both of his sabers. He started walking east... away from the rest of the group. He put up his hood and started looking for new skills to learn...<br/>_________________<br/>The morons do the stupidest things, but who is the true moron, the judger or the moron himself?
