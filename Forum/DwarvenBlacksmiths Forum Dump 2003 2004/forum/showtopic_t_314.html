     Haggis Brokennose was born in a small mining village some miles from Ironforge, not so terribly long ago. Born somewhat before him was his friend, more like brother, Munin Stonehand. Both of them earned their names in the same incident, and it went something like this. Haggis was by his house practicing with his axe when he heard some shouting. Looking in the direction he heard it he saw several other dwarves of about his age advancing on his friend Munin. Dropping his axe he ran to his friends age and they were soon ingaged in quite a brawl. In the chaos and confussion of the fighting Munin grabbed the nearest man to him and fetched him a wopping blow straight on the nose. However, to his chagrin, he found that the the dwarf at the end of his fist was none other than Haggis. Haggis didn't even flinch, he just smiled and kicked Munin in the stomach. From that day forward Haggis was called Brokennose because when it healed (without being set) it was qutie noticably broken. Munin was called Stonehand for the resounding blow he had struck Haggis.

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Now long before the day of his naming, Haggis lived in a small mining village (even smaller). His father was of the same name, Haggis Rockrider, and his mother was Anhelda. His father cut stone on the slopes of a nearby hill, an important if mundane job because most of the structures in the village were stone. One day, while Haggis was quite young, the village was attacked. Rockrider took up his war-hammer and ran out of the house to join the other men in a last ditch effort of defense. Anhelda hid Haggis in a secret compartment made for hiding things, for these were troubled days. She then took up a large carving knife, barred the door, shuttered the windows, and crouched in a corner amongst the shadows. Haggis heard naught but the shouts of men, the screams of women, and then silence. He slept.
<br/>
     At first the cause of his awakening was unapparent, then a snuffling sound became audible. Scraping and some grunting, and then blinding light in what was inky blackness. Haggis was lifted up from his hiding place to look into the face of an unknown but kind looking dwarf. This Dwarf was part of a small party that had survived the fight but had not been able to stop the slaughter of everyone else. Haggis was raised by this kindly dwarf, the father of Munin Stonehand.

Now there comes a day when every dwarf must pick his weapon, and be it assured that aside from being born and a  dwarve's name day (the day they resive their meaningful last name i.e. Brokennose) this is perhaps the most important event in their life. The sun shone crisp on that day, the color of a lemon's flesh. The leaves were russet and aubern, golden flights filled the sky as the wind blustered from the west. A fine day, truly, a day that fills one's heart with the want to go forth upon a trail, to set one foot before the other continuously and to always wonder what lay beyond the next hill. Haggis wondered what lay beyond the next hill.
<br/>
     "Course I'm sure about this Munin, no one will miss us in the chaos of Chossing Day."
<br/>
"Not that ya fool, I mean this treasure your telling me about, are you sure this isn't just another one of your crazy ideas?"
<br/>
"How many times do I have to tell you before you'll believe me, I heard it with my own ears from the old man as he died, the words were clear as your ass at midnight. He said, 'Seek ye the treasure of Odrin Maximor! Seek ye not far, for it lies near. Nigh many years, and some years yet before, the hand of Keidrin Maximor layed it deep beneath the earth, at the base of the tree. And now ye the tree by it's mark, for it be marked by an axe and a hammer. Follow ye the birds in their flight when the leaves blow, 10 and 4 leauges south, untill Modrin do aline itself with the sun at its peak. Seek ye there the tallest tree, and look ye upon this tree to see that it bears the mark. Search ye thrice an axe handle below the surface, and find ye there the treasure, of value beyond measure...beyond measure...' and then he died. THAT'S how I know this is real.
<br/>
"How the bloody hell did you remember all that?!"
<br/>
"It was written on a piece of parchment in his hand. I read it untill I had it memorized, and then I burned it."
<br/>
"But 14 leagues, we can't do that in one day. Even at the Battle of Bristle* the dwarves covered only 12 leagues in a day to arrive in time to turn the battle."
<br/>
"Think I haven't thought about that? I told mom that we were going to spend the night on the mountain to comune with the ancesters. *nudges Munin, grinning and winking* Eh? Eh? You see? *falsely pompous* Haggis thinks of all. Naught escapes his keen eye and quick wit. Have faith in him and ye shall have thine rewards in due time. Patience, and all will come. Trust in the divine providince of"
<br/>
"I'll give YOU divine providince" *Socks in stomach*
<br/>
"Oof! I must admonish," said Haggis is a jokingly superior yet whining voice, "That that was MOST uncalled for."
<br/>
"I must disagree. About the only thing ever MORE called for than that is me taking a piss just now." Munin pormptly walked of the small road that was more of a trail, into the woods not thirty feet away, with the singular goal of relieving the pressure that had build up within his bladder.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Haggis Brokennose on Thu Dec 04, 2003 2:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Morning dawned clammy gray with the promise of rain. Both Munin and Haggis were feeling a bit bitter. There had been no fire, there had been no food but for dried meat, although there was plenty of that, and the ground had been plauged with rocks that one could not detect untill asleep. This aside, they were eager to get going and find this treasure, because, well, it was treasure.
<br/>
"And tell your friends!" Haggis roared as he threw a fist sized stone with all of his might.
<br/>
"A commendable throw borther mine, but I must say I do not understand your fury. The rock bore you no malice. Moreover, IT should be the one inraged, for it was upon the ground first, and it was YOU that lay down upon IT. How would YOOUUU feel if a great rock came and lay upon you. Now thi-"
<br/>
"Oh shut up Munin."
<br/>
"Sorry."
<br/>
*sighs*"No, I am. I know you were just trying to liven things up, but I'm feeling like a rung towel this morening. Bloody old man, I'd have never missed the treasure if I never new it was there."
<br/>
"True that."
<br/>
"I thought this would be a grand adventure. Out by morning, do a bit of walking, get some free treasure, home for supper and a warm bed."
<br/>
"Yeah, but after we get it this will be worth it. Depending on the treasure we may never have to do an honest days work in our lives."
<br/>
"I Don't know about you, Munin, but I could except no greater an ambition from myself."
<br/>
"Nor I Haggis, nor I."
<br/>
"Walking and talking is a fine thing, but with ones mouth moving ones feet begin to slacken. Let's get going." Munin moved to a distance-eating jog. A jogging dwarf is quite a funny thing to behold. Running they look fierce and deadly, because about the only time they run is in battle. Walking they look like, well, wlking dwarves. But jogging, their stout legs pumping in strides too long for their height, bouncing up and down at the unaccustomed pace. Attach some sleigh bells to their ankles and they'd be a mighty spectacle pulling a sleigh along, like fat ponies. Of course your lose your hand before you could attach the first bell, because these ARE dwarves we're talking about. Yes, puffing, jogging, ale-drinking, pipe-smoking dwarves. And don't you forget it.
<br/>

<br/>
"Haggis?"
<br/>
"Mm?"
<br/>
"What direction to birds fly in the fall?"
<br/>
"South. Why?"
<br/>
"What direction are we going?"
<br/>
"Um..well the sun rises in the...east..?. And if thats east...now what was it dad said to remember the compass points by?"
<br/>
"Night Elves Sip Wine. North, east, south, west."
<br/>
"So east..." Haggis turned several circles, "By the beard of Magni! We ARE going south!"
<br/>
"Why do you sound surp.." sudden realization dawned upon him, "YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY WE WERE GOING?!!! wE COULD HAVE BEEN GOING THE WRONG WAY THE WHOLE TIME AND HAD TO TURN AROUND AND GO ALL THE WAY BACK AND FOR NOTHING BUT TO SET OUT AGAIN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. YOU-" Munin was at a loss for words. But when words will night suffice, actions will. They rolled down the imbankment on the western side of the road. Cursing ad spluttering and howling unintelligably they fell. Kicking and punching and wrestling they fell. Right into a tree they fell. Into foggy black unconciousness they fell.
<br/>

<br/>
"Geroff you great oaf!" Haggis said halfheartedly with a heave and a shove.
<br/>
"Gimme your bloody hand you stupid bung-dwarf (A drunkard)."
<br/>
"I'll give YOU-"
<br/>
"Oh shut up n' help me up. I'm too tired and too numb to fight anymore."
<br/>
"Then you surrender? I win?"
<br/>
"You as tired and hurt as I am you bloody idiot. We'll call it a draw."
<br/>
" 'S goo-" He stopped in a stunned silence.
<br/>
" Wha-" He too stopped in a stunned silence.
<br/>
"The sun is high and aligned with Modrin!!!"
<br/>
They rushed up the embankment to the road. There they turned about, looking. East, about a half mile away, was their goal, the tallest tree in the area. They ran.
<br/>

<br/>
"How deep is that?"
<br/>
"About three axe handles." 
<br/>
"Damn." Three hours had passed.
<br/>
"But this is the tree!" Haggis protested, half to himself, half to Munin, half to the sky above. Dwarves aren't very good at math.
<br/>
"One more hole. One more hole. If the treasure isn't in the next hole than I'm going home whether you come with me or not." 
<br/>
"Alright, but lets try a little deeper. It might be just a bit deeper and we would miss if we didn't thrust the shovel one more time." Haggis was optimistic, but losing hope fast. The old man HAD been insane for years before he died, but he wasn't about to admit this to Munin. What he wouldn't give for a tankard and a plate of- There was a resounding clang.
<br/>
"OOH! OHH!"
<br/>
"AHH! WOO!" Haggis jumped in the hole and began digging with a will. Luckily Haggis HAD thought ahead for once and brought along shovels. The axe and hammer could have been used if he hadn't, but those weren't exactly the best tools for the job. They were now leaning against the tree, precisely where they had been when Haggis and Munin arrived. 
<br/>
"There it is, thats the treasure! THE TREASURE! Come on, help me heave this box and...one. two! THREE!" With a mighty effort and several more 123's the chest was out of the hole.
<br/>
"Get the hammer Haggis, we'll smash this lock off and see what all this was for." Haggis ran to the tree with a will, snatched up the hammer, and turned to go back to the chest. The attack was sudden and ferocious.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br/>
"HOOA!" Came the bestial roar from Haggis.
<br/>
"FOR MAGNI!" Was the equally hearty cry that came from Munin.
<br/>
Munin charged straight at the troll, perhaps twenty yards from him, his might hammer ready for a crushing blow. Had Haggis and Munin had the momentary hesitation that the trolls expectd from them, the trolls might have won. Even at their young age though, Haggis and Munin were well trained in the art of fighting. That momentary hesitation had long since been removed from their instincts.
<br/>
Munin, in his excitement, did not think. He charged at a dead run and swung as mightily as his could at the troll without breaking stride. The troll raised his axe to blow the furious blow, but the combined force Munin, running, and a hammer swung with full strength was too much. His axe flew from his hand and the Head of the hammer smashed into his chest. The troll was dead instantly.
<br/>
     Haggis had thought. He had not charged as Munin, but had aproached purposefully adn cautiosly. This would have been good if he was trained with a weapon, but he was not. Munin had used force and had been lucky. Haggis was trying to use skill he did not have, and there could be no such luck. The troll lashed out with quick swings of his much lighter axe. Haggis blocked and dodged as best he could, but was soon covered with numerous painful, but not serious wounds. Slowly he was being pushed back to the tree. Realizing this he lunged forward suddenly, moving into an offensive stance. He swung, not mighty swings but more calculated. Now the troll was on the defence. Thining he saw an opening Haggis threw his whole weight into the next swing. It would have been enough to cleave the troll in two, but the troll was nimble, he lept back quickly, then lunged forward. Haggis would have died then, but such force had he put into the swing that the momentum of the axe blade actually pulled him of balance so that his body shifted fractionally, making the troll graze his shoulder, wrather than brain him. Haggis brought the axe back along precisely the same path before the troll had time to recover. The blade buried itself deep within the trolls side. The troll stared him in the eye, still standing, never relinquishing. This went on for some time, both the troll and Haggis frozen in that moment. Haggis realized that the troll was dead, but that his death grip on the axe handle and the blade in the trols side were keeping the troll of collapsing. Moving his left hand up the shaft Haggis wrenched it free from the trolls side. Crimson blood gushed forth, steaming, staining the earth.
<br/>

<br/>
"Damn."
<br/>
"Agreed."
<br/>
"You alright Munin?"
<br/>
"It's you got cut up." Munin tore of his right sleeve, baring his muscular arm,  and tied the strip of cloth aroung a gash in Haggis' thigh, the worst of the wounds. The bleeding lessened untill it stopped.
<br/>
"Let's get this treasure than, and get back. I'm ready for some food and a good nights sleep." Munin was very tired, and Haggis was most agreeable to this plan, because he was even more tired. 
<br/>
With little emotion Munin smashed open the chest, spilling out a lot of moldy cloth and a large handful of dirty gold coins.
<br/>
"Not as much as I was expecting, but still a lot more than I ever thought I'd have." Haggis found it hard to be excited.
<br/>
"Split two ways thats still about a pouchful of gold each." Munin counted them with his eyes, than nudged half the pile toward Haggis.
<br/>
"Do you hear something Munin."
<br/>
"Yeah, sounds like-" A small dwarven boy stumped out of the underbrush, kicked on of the trolls savagly with his small foot, then came on toward Munin and Haggis.
<br/>
Said he in his piping voice, "I'm Durgan. They," He looked toward the dead trolls, "Attacked the village with some others. The men fought back but these two grabbed me and ran, then the others broke off and joined up with the others. I ran away last night and these two have been after me. They were just catching up when they ran into you. I think I was going to be dinner."
<br/>
"Lucky for you we were here."
<br/>
"Smart move getting away."
<br/>
"I'm sleepy though. And hugry. Do you have anything to eat?"
<br/>
"Here you are ya little blighter," Haggis handed him some dried meat. Munin and Haggis tok their share and placed it in their puches, and the three of the set of to return home. Durgan soon grew to sleepy to continue, so Munin picked him up and carried him because Haggis was weak from his wounds. They walked through the night.
<br/>
     Early morning sun touched the peaks of the small village. Munin, a sleeping Durgan on his shoulder, led the party down the muddy lane, followed by a slightly limping Haggis. Both were ragged, hungry, and perhaps not so strangly both still bor their weapons from the battle. 
<br/>
"By the...Is that..?! AN! COME QUICK! MAIB! IT'S HAGGIS AND DURGAN WITH YOUR BOY! HAGGIS! MUNIN!" The man ran toward them, arms flung wide.
<br/>
"eh," what the monotone response. They were bone weary, hungry, and wanted more than anything to find their beds. Durgan's mother ran to them and snatche dup her son, thanked them, and bustled him off to their home. Haggis and Munin were shambling towards their home when Munin's father stepped from the doorway. 
<br/>
"You boys missed Choosing Day." The voice was deceptively quiet, but so obviously deceptive as to be blatantly menacing.
<br/>
"um..."
<br/>
"You could have been killed by those trolls."
<br/>
"Well we sort of..."
<br/>
"Perhaps you have something to say in your defence?" Haggis stepped up to that.
<br/>
"We killed two trolls and saved Durgan!"
<br/>
"Well now. Killed two trolls did you."
<br/>
"May we never grow beards if we didn't!" Said Munin
<br/>
"Mmm. Well than you didn't really miss choosing day, did you. You seem to have shosen your weapons. This hadn't ocurred to either of them. Suddenly they took notice of the weapons they held. They grinned at each other.
<br/>
"The final choices have been made for the year," bellowed Munin's father for all the town to hear, "For Haggis the two-handed axe. And for Munin, the war hammer." There was a mighty cheer from every house, as everyone had by now been arroused by the news of their return. 
<br/>
"It is customary, if not necessarily officially costumary, for the two of you to steal a keg from the tavern cellar and go get drunk somewhere. I might sort of not notice your absence if you were to, say, dissapear for an hour or two."
<br/>
"What we want is food and then sleep." Both nodded furiously.
<br/>
"Aiy, I'll bet you do. In with you then, there is meat and bread and cheese, as well as ale. Go on." They ate with a passion, then retired for the longest and deepest sleep of their lives. Their parents never found out about the gold, but they were very discreet with it and saved the vast majority for later in life. 
<br/>
     And so it was that Haggis Brokennose and Munin Stonehand set out in search of treasure, and returned saviors, warriors, and friends.
<br/>

I can see ya put a lot of thought into ya backgrounds an' the local dwarven ways.  I agree an' share most of the same as yerselfs.  It even better of a tale for it has both Munin an' Haggis.  This is a first but no less grand way to tell ones story.  It pleases me that ones so young have so much pride an' courage for kin or other.  Trolls a feral warriors an' I have seen much more seasoned lads fall to them blue hearted beaties spears.  I know ya don't need to be readin' more bu I am sure that we all like to read more tales from ya boths past for I am sure there many.  *chuckles* I ya feel up or it there a topic in the Fellowship forums that are for the like.  Its hasn't got any tales yet but I like to see that changed.  Anyhow, I think I have ramble on far to long.  I ll let some one els step up an praise ya work.  May the Light guide ya feet.

By Haggis Brokennose 
<br/>
Edited by Munin Stonehand 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
A day came in spring when Barl, Munin and Haggis&#8217;s father, was to take a trip to an outlying mining village to meet up with a caravan which he was escorting back to Ironforge. Munin and Haggis begged him to allow them to come along, and eventually he consented, so long as they promised to behave themselves (They had a reputation for getting into trouble, but this was mostly Haggis&#8217;s fault as most of the things that go them in trouble were his idea). Early the next morning, the sun still asleep behind the eastern mountains, they left by a side gate and made their way down into the valley. By early afternoon they were coming to the village. 
<br/>
&#8220;Dad, why don&#8217;t they have a wall?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;The camp is only semi-permanent, they&#8217;ll be out of here after the next shipment of ore. Building a wall would just be a waste of time and materials. It&#8217;s very unlikely that there would ever be any kind of organized attack. The few guards can easily take care of any trouble with trolls or troggs most of the time.&#8221; Then in a more serious voice, &#8220;And please stay out of trouble. I&#8217;ll be the one to get it if anything happens.&#8221; 
<br/>
They were now passing the first houses and quickly coming to the open center of the town. The town sat directly at the foot of a hill, and up on the hill were several mine shaft openings. Dwarves bustled in and out, stained with earth and bearing tools and carts with raw ore. 
<br/>
A man near a larger building in the square called out to Barl and he headed that way, giving Munin and Haggis a look as he went. Haggis looked to Munin, &#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;That&#8217;s hardly a question. I know YOU want to go and take a look at the mines.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Yea, but I asked what YOU wanted to do.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t really matter to me. We&#8217;re going to have a goodly while, so we&#8217;re going to see just about everything here before we have to leave.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;True. So mines first then?&#8221; Haggis loved mines and the earth. Munin preferred smithing to mining, but since there weren&#8217;t any smithies here he was somewhat impartial. They were just passing out of the town when they saw a group of five dwarves, only somewhat older than themselves, coming down the hill. Haggis had a bad feeling about this from the start. The way they walked, the way they looked at Haggis and Munin as they approached, this was the trouble that they weren&#8217;t supposed to get into, but it was looking pretty unavoidable. Just before they got into hearing range Munin whispered to Haggis, &#8220;Keep it cool Haggis.&#8221; Obviously Munin was thinking the same thing he was. 
<br/>
&#8220;That your old man?&#8221; The largest of them asked, jerking his head in the direction of the square where Barl was speaking with the man. 
<br/>
&#8220;Well he&#8217;s not particularly old, but he is my father.&#8221; Munin sounded defiant, almost belligerent. &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic">Oh great</span>,&#8217; Haggis thought to himself, &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic">You tell ME to keep it cool and then go trying to piss this guy off!</span>&#8217; Haggis slowly changed his stance, preparing for what he felt was obviously coming. 
<br/>
&#8220;Well I just thought from the way he carried himself he was old. Y&#8217;know, kinda couldn&#8217;t support himself. But if you say he ain&#8217;t old&#8230;&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8216;<span style="font-style: italic">Stupid, stupid, stupid. He&#8217;s trying o prove himself and he hopes to thrash us so he&#8217;ll look big and tough in front of his little buddies</span>.&#8217; The guy kept talking, but Haggis wasn&#8217;t listening. He was watching deafly, waiting for someone to take the first move. 
<br/>
&#8220;I bet my dad could thrash him.&#8221; 
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Real mature. What a terrifying statement. Anything intelligent to say Gigantor? </span>(Haggis doesn&#8217;t know the guy&#8217;s name so he calls him Gigantor) &#8216;Gigantor&#8217;s attention swayed to Haggis. 
<br/>
&#8220;What are you looking at, is there a problem?&#8221; Gigantor took a step toward Haggis. 
<br/>
Well, if it&#8217;s unavoidable&#8230;&#8221;Only problem I see is you!&#8221; Haggis&#8217;s fist came rushed forward, striking &#8216;Gigantor&#8217; a resounding blow to the side of the jaw. There was an audible pop, and &#8216;Gigantor&#8217; dropped like a felled tree. The other four jumped at Haggis and Munin before he hit the ground. 
<br/>

<br/>
&#8220; &#8217;s going on up there?&#8221; Ori said, looking over Barl&#8217;s shoulder. Barl turned around. 
<br/>
&#8220;Sh!t!&#8221; He was running toward the fight before Ori could speak another word to him. So Ori spoke to himself. 
<br/>
&#8220;I wonder what got him up &#8216;n running so fast. Just a fight.&#8221; Fights were pretty common in the mining village, and widely ignored. Ori shrugged his shoulders and moved on to the alehouse.  
<br/>

<br/>
Munin and Haggis were outnumbered, even with &#8216;Gigantor&#8217; down. Things degenerated rapidly, everyone tossing and heaving about on the ground, generally moving downhill. Fists flew, feet kicked out, hands grasped. The din rising from the pile of writhing bodies consisted mostly of profanity and assorted exclamations of pain. Munin and Haggis were doing pretty good, all things considered, but both were quite aware of the fact that they would lose eventually. Eventually was the key word in that phrase though; both were determined to do what they could before that happened. Haggis was raining blows upon one of them when another struck him in the back from behind. Haggis hit the ground rolling and kicked the feet out from under his assailant. A swift kick to the stomach produced a satisfying &#8216;Oof&#8217;. Munin was knocked over and rolled down the hill a ways. Regaining his feet he dashed back to the fray, grabbing dwarves and heaving them down the hill. He snatched one by the collar and struck him a savage blow to the nose. 
<br/>
&#8220;Grraahhhff! You stupid bastard!&#8221; To Munin&#8217;s dismay he realized that the dwarf he currently gripped was Haggis. 
<br/>
&#8220;Ah crap. I&#8217;m-&#8220; 
<br/>
&#8220;Ahh, shut up, we have fighting to do!&#8221; Both turned around expecting to see four very angry dwarves advancing on them. Instead they saw Barl, and this was far more terrible than the previous. 
<br/>
&#8220;What the hell do you think your doing?&#8221; Again that deathly quiet voice. 
<br/>
&#8220;They started the fight, they tried to. We couldn&#8217;t avoid it!&#8221; Haggis and Munin protested simultaneously, but to no avail. Barl breathed deeply, as though trying to take control of himself. They worried what would happen if that deep breath didn&#8217;t work. He was about to speak when- 
<br/>
&#8220;You boys did a pretty good job on these ones. Heh, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen Carrik laid out like that in all my years. For once someone showed &#8216;em he wasn&#8217;t invincible.&#8221; The old man had been watching from his back porch the entire time without anyone noticing him. Barl turned to him. 
<br/>
&#8220;Who are you, if I might ask?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;I&#8217;m Weldrik, too old to work and too young to die. Ye needn&#8217;t be too hard on these two, fights are pretty common, especially when Carrik is involved.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;I see.&#8221; It sounded an improvement, but still not to promising. 
<br/>
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s time for an old man&#8217;s nap. I&#8217;ll be leaving you three.&#8221; Weldrik ambled off. 
<br/>
Good timing my old friend. Thanks. 
<br/>
&#8220;Well.&#8221; That didn&#8217;t sound too bad. A deep sigh. &#8220;The caravan&#8217;s ready to go now, so it&#8217;s time to be off. Come on.&#8221; With that Barl turned and started down the hill. 
<br/>
&#8220;Good work mine friend. You broke.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;I what?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Broke it. My nose. It&#8217;s broken.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;I&#8217;m-&#8220; 
<br/>
&#8220;Shut up. Heh, I think I might even let it heal like this.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Why would you do that?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Kinda has a nice ring it, &#8216;Haggis Brokennose&#8217;, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Whatever you say. But you don&#8217;t get to name yourself. Names get nominated and then those close to you choose.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Well than you can nominate it for me!&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Then you owe me a favor.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Do I know? And what is it you&#8217;re wanting?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;You to nominate a name for ME.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Oh, and what name am I to nominate?&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;How about &#8216;Stonehand&#8217;. That sounds good.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;It does indeed, very good. I like that our names go together like that.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;My stone hand broke your nose. Yes indeed. Very fitting.&#8221; They were now walking out of the village, some distance behind their father and the caravan. 
<br/>
&#8220;Stonehand might be a little more fitting name for you though. You DID drop Carrik in one blow.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Perhaps Stonehand fits me better now, but it won&#8217;t in just a second,&#8221; Haggis opened his fist and a sizable stone dropped from it. Munin laughed deeply. &#8220;I picked it up while to two were bantering back and forth. I figured the fight was inevitable, and seeing as we were outnumbered, I thought I&#8217;d tip the scaled a bit back our way.&#8221; Munin laughed again. 
<br/>
&#8220;You would do that.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Yea, I would, and I did.&#8221; Haggis paused, then spoke purposefully; &#8220;I say we take a vow, here and now, to never be like them, and to protect other people from those like them, even if the odds are vastly against us.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Sounds good to me. Bastards. Today we saw five dwarves with just their fists, but everywhere in the world there are people like them that will push anyone around that they can and take what they want.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;I vow to fight against them always.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;And I.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Well that was pretty formal.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Bah, fit the mood. But if you ever start theeing and thouing me ill break your nose again.&#8221; 
<br/>
&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; 
<br/>

<br/>
The sun had long since found its bed behind the mountains when they arrived back at Ironforge with the caravan. Once inside the gates, they turned right and left the caravan behind them because it no longer needed Barl&#8217;s protection. Barl finally took notice of Haggis&#8217;s broken nose. 
<br/>
&#8220;Looks like one of them got you a good one.&#8221; Haggis looked sidelong at Munin. 
<br/>
&#8220;Yep, he sure did.&#8221;<br/>_________________<br/>Gimme 'n axe 'n I'll take care of it!

<br/>
"Ahh, shut up Haggis, you're too bloody loud for the morning." Haggis was snoring lightly. You could tell how much he'd had to drink by how loudly he snored. He hadn't had much last night, obviously. Munin's hangover amplified sound though, so it was quite intollerable. He was unnused to drinking, he hadn't done much serious drinking yet. Dazzidly snatching a cushion he wrapped it around his head and tried to go back to sleep.
<br/>
     It was early morning, before the sun rises from slumber. Dwarves were everywhere. Snoring, sleeping, drunken dwarves in puddles of ale. Last night had been special. Munin couldn't remember why, but since it had already happened it wasn't necessary that it be remembered so that it could occur. At any rate, they had found an excuse to drink even more than usual, which wasn't that unusual.
