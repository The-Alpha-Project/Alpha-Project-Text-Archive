<br/>
Prince Arthas was born at the very end of the Second Great War, growing up amongst a failing Alliance and a world being ravaged by the Orcish Horde. As a youth, Arthas was trained in combat by Muradin Bronzebeard, the brother of the mighty King Magni of Ironforge. Arthas became an adept swordsman, and a disciple of the Silver Hand at the young age of nineteen under the tutelage of Uther Lightbringer. Despite his rash and headstrong behavior, he became a well renowned warrior, with one of his more famed exploits being the defeat of savage troll warbands from Zul'Aman that had been raiding Quel'Thalas settlements.
<br/>

<br/>
During this time, Arthas began a relationship with the youngest daughter of Daelin Proudmoore, Jaina. The two were celebrated throughout the kingdom, despite efforts to keep their romance a secret. Still, the populous hoped that the young prince had found a fitting bride to carry on the royal bloodline. Indeed, even the young elven prince Kael'thas was jealous of their affair, being in love with Jaina himself. However, Jaina's devotion to her studies in Dalaran, as well as the unwanted attention being paid to their personal lives, demanded that they put an end to their affair; however they continued on with a strong friendship.
<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040925151055im_/http://www.war3.com/lore/humans/arthas.jpg" border="0"/>Soon troubles began to arise in Lordaeron. The rising of the Horde under a new leader coupled with the mysterious plague gripping the northlands sent worry throughout the kingdom. Arthas was sent to Strahnbrad to meet with his teacher Uther and assess the situation, only to learn that a raid was planned on the defenseless village. Arthas was ordered to quell the threat, but unfortunately he arrived too late and was only successful in preventing further damage from the rampaging orcs. However, soon a much more vile threat arose. Jaina was sent to join Arthas upon orders to investigate the strange plague. More than just the plague, they found Undead armies had taken over region, and soon discovered a granary infested with the plague. Upon arriving in the town of Brill, they found the Necromancer, Kel'Thuzad, who appeared to be the leader of the death cult spreading the plague. They quickly followed him to Andorhal.
<br/>

<br/>
Finally confronting Kel'Thuzad at the outskirts of town, Arthas promptly slew the necromancer. Before the final death blow, Kel'Thuzad spoke of Mal'Ganis, a demon of the Nethrazim who was at the heart of the conflict. Jaina and Arthas traveled north to confront him in Stratholme, stopping in Hearthglen, where thy hoped to rest. Instead, they found the town being attacked by masses of Undead led by a pair of scheming Liches. To their horror, Arthas and Jaina soon discovered that the plague was not the means of mass murder, but rather a means of turning innocent townsfolk into the vicious Undead. Arthas stayed behind to defend Hearthglen as Jaina fled to find Uther. Barely able to hold off the waves of Undead, Arthas was on the verge of defeat when Uther arrived with reinforcements and saved the village. Arthas, humiliated, vowed to go to Stratholme to have his revenge on Mal'Ganis, who he believed was behind everything, whether Uther agreed or not.
<br/>

<br/>
On route to Stratholme, Arthas was met by the enigmatic Prophet. He gave him the same advice as Terenas, to abandon his kingdom and travel to Kalimdor. Arthas argued that his place was with his people, and vowed that he would not abandon them. Jaina, however, disagreed, and believed that perhaps the Prophet did have some insight. Arthas refused to heed the advice, and continued on to Stratholme.
<br/>

<br/>
Upon arriving, Arthas found that the tainted grain had been distributed already, and knew that soon the townsfolk would become Undead. He ordered Uther to destroy the entire town, but horrified at the command, Uther rebuked him. Arthas proclaimed that Uther had committed treason, and sent him away in shame. He demanded that his loyal soldiers join him in carrying out the orders. Jaina, surprised and dismayed at Arthas' decision, left with Uther.
<br/>

<br/>
As Arthas began slaying the corrupted townsfolk of Stratholme, he was met by Mal'Ganis himself. Mal'Ganis began to corrupt the townsfolk further and claimed their souls for his own. Arthas worked to destroy the townsfolk before Mal'Ganis could use them to bolster the Undead forces, eventually succeeding in purging the town. Arthas finally demanded a final showdown with the Dread Lord. Mal'Ganis, however, slipped away, vowing to meet him in Northrend.
<br/>

<br/>
Arthas followed him with a detachment of troops. They arrived in Northrend a month later at Daggercap Bay. As they searched for a proper place to set up camp, Arthas came upon his good friend, Muradin Bronzebeard. Muradin thought, at first, that Arthas was a rescue party for his men, who had been besieged by Undead as they searched for the runeblade Frostmourne. Informing Muradin of his intentions in Northrend, the dwarf and his troops quickly joined Arthas'G cause. Muradin and Arthas, in search of Mal'Ganis destroyed the nearby Undead camp, but there was still no sign of the Dread Lord.
<br/>

<br/>
As Muradin and Arthas went out to look for Frostmourne, an emissary arrived with orders from Uther and Terenas for Arthas and his men to return home. When Arthas returned, the men had abandoned their posts, making their way through the forest towards their boats. Outraged and despite Muradin's protests, Arthas set out to burn the boats with the help of some indigenous mercenaries. When his men arrived, Arthas betrayed his mercenaries, blaming them for the ships' destruction, and set his troops to kill them. With no means of going home, Arthas informed his men that the only way out of Northrend was through victory.
<br/>

<br/>
Arthas and his troops continued to press on towards Draktharon Keep in search of Frostmourne. As he arrived, Mal'Ganis appeared to him, and foretold his death. Arthas heedlessly went to search for Frostmourne with Muradin, leaving his captain to defend the camp. Arthas soon found the Guardian, who tried to keep Arthas from Frostmourne, apparently for his own protection. The Guardian fell, and Arthas and Muradin claimed their prize. But Muradin, reading an inscription, reported that the blade was cursed. Arthas heedlessly took up the sword, willing to bear any curse to save his people. And as he took the sword, the last vestiges of compassion were stripped away.
<br/>

<span style="color: Red"><span style="font-weight: bold">As the sword exploded from its icy prison, a shard shot out and killed Muradin.</span></span> With Frostmourne at his command, Arthas defeated Mal'Ganis' base, and finally confronted the demon. Mal'Ganis told him that now that Frostmourne was held by him, he was under the control of the Lich King. However, that control was instructing him to destroy Mal'Ganis. The dreadlord was destroyed, and, with the voices of Frostmourne still raging in his head, Arthas fled into the frozen north, leaving his troops to die, and was stripped of the last remnants of sanity.

<br/>
Arthas finally returned home some time later, and all of Lordaeron rejoiced for their returning champion. However, as he entered the palace and knelt before the throne of his father, a dark power spoke in his mind. Arthas rose, approached the throne, and slew King Terenas, his own father. Fleeing from the castle, he was not heard from for many weeks. He reappeared soon in Vandermar village at the bidding of his new master, the Lich King. There, he met Tichondrius, a dreadlord like Mal'Ganis. Tichondrius explained that the sword had been designed to steal souls, and that Arthas' soul was the first to be stolen.
<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040925151055im_/http://www.war3.com/lore/undead/evilarthasicon.gif" border="0"/>
<br/>
Arthas assembled the Cult of the d**ned that was in hiding in Vandermar, and used their magical abilities as he traveled to Andorhal, where he was to recover Kel'Thuzad's corpse. Arthas killed Gavinrad, the paladin who guarded the crypt, and recovered the remains. This brought Kel'Thuzad's ghost into being, and he secretly instructed Arthas not to trust the dreadlords. Arthas quietly contemplated this.
<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040925151055im_/http://www.war3.com/lore/undead/evilarthas.jpg" border="0"/>
<br/>
Kel'Thuzad needed to be taken to Quel'Thalas to be revived, however his remains were in such a decomposed state that this would be no easy task. Tichondrius sent Arthas to recover the urn of King Terenas' ashes, guarded by Uther himself, to transport the body. Arthas killed Uther and desecrated his father's ashes to make space for Kel'Thuzad's remains. They then made the long journey to Quel'Thalas.
<br/>

<br/>
Once in Quel'thalas, Arthas met heavy resistance from the High Elves, particularly the elven ranger-general, Sylvanas Windrunner. As he pushed her forces steadily back towards Silvermoon and past the two magical Elfgates, he began to hate the woman with a growing passion. She tried to warn Silvermoon of his coming, but he instead destroyed her camps and killed her. However, as further payment for her insolence, he corrupted her spirit, manifesting her into one of the first Banshees.
<br/>

<br/>
Arthas soon destroyed Silvermoon and used the mystic Sunwell to bring Kel'Thuzad back as a lich, an insidious agent of the Lich King. As they traveled to Alterac from the burning remains of Quel'Thalas, Kel'Thuzad explained the full extent of the Legion's Invasion and the plans of Ner'zhul and the Scourge. They arrived in Alterac to destroy a clan of Orcs who had taken control of a demon gate, with which the lich would use to speak to the demonlord Archimonde. They defeated the Orcs, and upon communion with Archimonde, set out for Dalaran per his instruction to find the Book of Medivh, a powerful tome that would be used to summon the mighty Demonlord into this world.
<br/>

<br/>
Arthas and Kel'Thuzad's lay siege to Dalaran, and despite the valiant efforts to repel them by the Kirin Tor, the Undead armies fought through their magical defenses. They killed the Archmagi guarding the city, including Antonidas himself, and claimed the Book of Medivh for themselves. Now, Kel'thuzad prepared to summon Archimonde using the incantations found within the Book of Medivh. Arthas repelled the human forces who sought to stop the lich as Kel'Thuzad began the lengthy procedure of summoning the Demonlord. Finally, Archimonde arrived in Dalaran. With the Lich King no longer of any use, Archimonde placed Tichondrius in command of the Scourge, and Arthas was left to wonder what would become of him and Kel'Thuzad. The lich cryptically replied that all was going as the Lich King foresaw. The pair mysteriously disappeared and Arthas was not to be seen for quite some time.
<br/>

<br/>
It was during the invasion of Kalimdor, shortly after Illidan was freed that Arthas reappeared. Tichondrius had taken the Skull of Gul'dan and was using its arcane energies as a means of getting demons to Kalimdor. Arthas, on instruction by the Lich King, told Illidan how to claim the Skull's powers as his own, whereupon he could destroy Tichondrius. All went as planned, and Arthas disappeared again. However, it's unlikely that the Lich King is quite finished with him yet.
<br/>

<br/>
Several months later, the Burning Legion was finally defeated at the Battle of Mt. Hyjal. However, the Dread Lords Balnazzar, Detheroc and Varimathras remained in Lordaeron to oversee the Scourge, unaware that their masters across the ocean had been defeated. Kel'thuzad and Sylvanas worried with Arthas' disappearance, the Dread Lords would run the Scourge into the ground. But soon enough, Arthas returned to reclaim his kingdom. His first act was to scour Lordaeron of the last remaining Humans, killing all who tried to flee to the mountains. With the aid of Kel'thuzad and Sylvanas, he succeeded, however at the same time, his strength began to diminish as a crack in the Frozen Throne slowly depleted the Lich King's powers. Ner'zhul ordered Arthas to return to Northrend as the Lich King was in danger of being destroyed. 
<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040925151055im_/http://www.war3.com/lore/undead/arthasinpain.jpg" border="0"/>
<br/>
Arthas and Kel'thuzad returned to the capitol to prepare for a journey to Northrend, however Arthas soon found himself caught in a trap set by the Dread Lords. Arthas was forced to escape the city before he was overrun by the Dread Lord's minions. Although Arthas made his way out of Lordaeron City, he walked right into another trap. Sylvanas, who had regained her will after the Lich King was weakened, was determined to kill Arthas at all costs. Escorted by a band of her banshees, Arthas was ambushed in the wilderness, as Sylvanas poisoned him with a special paralyzing arrow. All seemed hopeless. But before Sylvanas could finish the job, Kel'thuzad returned to rescue his king and chase Sylvanas off. With the threat of Sylvanas behind them, Arthas finished preparing his ships and set sail for the Icecrown Glacier. Before he left, he entrusted his kingdom to Kel'thuzad, asking the lich to ensure that his legacy endured.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Three weeks later, Arthas finally arrived in Northrend. Although determined to reach the Icecrown Glacier and save the Lich King, Arthas was soon ambushed by the Blood Elves. Bitter from the destruction of their homeland, they sought to destroy Arthas and purge Northrend of Undead. But before Arthas could attack, Anub'arak and his band of crypt fiends emerged from the ground to fight off the Dragonhawk Riders. Anub'arak informed Arthas that he was sent by the Lich King to guide the Death Knight to the Frozen Throne. Welcoming the company, they both set out to save the Lich King. Destroying a small Blood Elf scouting force, Arthas soon met up with Prince Kael'thas, now a part of Illidan's army. His forces were already marching upon the Icecrown Glacier, and had a good lead over Arthas. As the elven prince left, Arthas' powers once again began to weaken. He knew that they must make haste, but worried that they may soon be too late. Anub'arak suggested another route, one directly through the shattered kingdom of Azjol-Nerub. Passing through the cavernous kingdom might buy them the time they needed to reach the Frozen Throne before Illidan and Kael'thas.
<br/>

<br/>
Before they could continue on to Azjol-Nerub, Arthas and Anub'arak were forced to dispatch the Blood Elf and Naga forces already entrenched at the kingdom's entrance. Learning of the vicious Blue Dragon Sapphiron who lived in a nearby canyon, Arthas devised a devious plan. The Death Knight slew the mighty dragon and brought his corpse back as a gigantic Frost Wyrm, completely loyal to the Scourge. With the aid of Sapphiron, Arthas and the Scourge defeated the enemy camps and made their way into the ancient spider kingdom. 
<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040925151055im_/http://www.war3.com/lore/undead/vsforgottenone.jpg" border="0"/>
<br/>
As Arthas and Anub'arak reached the entrance to Azjol-Nerub, they were ambushed by a group of dwarves. Surprised, Arthas soon learned that Muradin's men, whom he had stranded in Northrend after killing Muradin, had taken refuge in the caverns of Azjol-Nerub. Arthas sent Sapphiron after the dwarves guarding the entrance, but unfortunately was forced to leave the vicious dragon behind as he entered the labyrinth. The dwarves, lead by the Mountain King Baelgun, would be a threat Arthas had to deal with before he could continue on through the rest of the caves. The remaining Nerubians, still alive, also got in their way, but Arthas still fought his way through his enemies to Baelgun, blocking his path. Arthas slew Baelgun, but the dwarf warned him not to travel any deeper, as recent quakes had awoken foul creatures whom the dwarves did not want to escape. Bearing no heed to the warnings, Arthas and Anub'arak traveled down into the heart of the Inner Kingdom. As they descended the staircase, Arthas could sense the taint in the air and had a bad feeling about what they might find in the caves below.
<br/>

<br/>
As Arthas and Anub'arak traveled deeper into the Inner Kingdom, they encountered an increasing number of Nerubians. Rescuing many of their Crypt Fiend brethren from the Nerubians' nets, they continued on until they encountered a terrible foe. Huge tentacles protruded from the ground, strangling the energy out of Arthas' troops. And then, hideous creatures emerged from the darkness. The legendary Faceless Ones, the threat the dwarves had spoken of, began their assault. With a bit of effort, Arthas managed to push back their hordes, only to reach an even greater foe. Guarding the gates to the Upper Kingdom was the hideous master of the Faceless Ones, the Forgotten One. Arthas and Anub'arak fought for their lives, dodging tentacles and swarms of Faceless Ones as they rushed to defeat their powerful enemy. Finally, victory was at hand. Arthas and Anub'arak fled to the staircase, eager to avoid any further conflict from these vicious opponents.
<br/>

<br/>
As the two reached the Upper Kingdom, a massive earthquake caused a huge cave-in. Arthas was trapped, alone and weakened. Braving scores of dangerous traps and foes, Arthas finally managed to escape, meeting up with Anub'arak halfway through the cavern. As the caves began to collapse around them, Arthas and Anub'arak fought their way through waves of Faceless Ones, finally reaching the exit to Azjol-Nerub. They were now at the base of the Icecrown Glacier, ready to take on Illidan's army and save the Lich King from destruction. Ner'zhul contacted Arthas once more. The Lich King explained that a crack in the Frozen Throne was the cause of his weakening, a crack created when Ner'zhul thrust the mighty Frostmourne, once a part of the Throne, from the ice into Arthas' grip. The sword had been given to Arthas, so that he may free the Lich King from his icy prison. And with this knowledge in his head, Ner'zhul returned what power he could to Arthas to prepare him for the battle to come.
<br/>

<br/>
Illidan and Kael'thas' forces had already entrenched themselves at the base of the Glacier when Arthas arrived. The Frozen Throne was protected by four Obelisks, two of which Illidan's army were guarding. Once one side had claimed all four, they would be granted access to the Throne. Arthas knew he had to be quick to beat Illidan to his target. Rallying the Scourge, Arthas managed to push back Illidan, retaking the Obelisks he had controlled and gaining access to the Lich King. But before entering the chamber, there was one more battle to fight. As Arthas made his way to the Glacier, Illidan stood there waiting for him. The two mighty foes engaged in battle.
<br/>

<br/>
The two were locked in battle, until finally, there was a victor. Arthas stood over Illidan's slain body, and then made his way to the top of the Icecrown Glacier. Ascending the huge spiral staircase, thoughts of his past floated through Arthas' mind. His betrayal of his former friends, Uther and Muradin, rushed through his head as he continued to climb. Finally, he reached the top. The Lich King uttered these words: "Return the blade.. Complete the Circle... Release me from this prison!" Arthas, knowing what he must do, rushed towards the Throne, Frostmourne in hand, and thrust the blade into the ice, smashing the Frozen Throne to pieces. Ner'zhul's armor slammed to the floor, his helmet dropping at Arthas' feet. Arthas picked it up, and placed it on his head.
<br/>

<br/>
The walls began to crumble around him, as Arthas felt a huge surge of power rush into his body. The sky was exposed around him, but Arthas' eyes remained closed. He could feel Ner'zhul's soul enter into his body. As Arthas opened his eyes, they glowed a cold, hellish blue. Ner'zhul and Arthas had became one.
<br/>

<br/>
The Lich King sat on his Throne, no longer trapped inside it, atop the Icecrown Glacier. He gazed out into the vastness of Northrend, eager to seize control of the entire world.
