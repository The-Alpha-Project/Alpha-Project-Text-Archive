<br/>
Forensic War </span></span>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Brill, Lordaeron 
<br/>
The Year 599 
<br/>
Two months after the Orcs landed on Southshore, Lordaeron (WC2: Tides of Darkness) 
<br/>

<br/>
The light of the seventh day beamed upon the peaceful town of Brill, a town that never had a murder or robbery in it's record. 
<br/>
It was a fairly populated town that had a river for a great water supply. There was also a caravan station for getting supplies to many locations. That is why Brill was a major keypoint for the Alliance to support the war against the Orcish Horde. 
<br/>
But for a strange reason, every supply caravan they sent, never returned. 
<br/>

<br/>
A young, 60 year old Dwarf named Khimada, awoke in an apartment near Brill's river. His sleep was disturbed by the church bells a block away from him. 
<br/>
He pulled the covers away from him, rubbing his eyes that didn't feel like they should when he woke up in the morning. Then he realized that he had missed church! 
<br/>
Why didn't his parents wake him up? They ussally did unless they drunk too much ale and forgot about him. 
<br/>

<br/>
His mother was the one that ussally woke him up. She was kind, helping, and never gave up on him. 
<br/>
His father however, was nice, but he was quite seedy. 
<br/>
He trained Khimada in the arts of stealth and combat for 10 years already. Khimada didn't exactly know why. 
<br/>
But it did pay off when a Human bully stole his schoolwork, thinking he could claim it on his own. 
<br/>
But Khimada's father encouraged him to steal it back. 
<br/>
Khimada entered the bully's farmhouse that same night, and stole it while he, and his deadbeat family, were sleeping. 
<br/>
He turned the work in to his tutor and got a good grade for his work that payed off. 
<br/>
His father was a good man to decide that. 
<br/>
His father also left the house often, for reasons Khimada didn't know. His mother acted strange and nervous after he went on his "errands", as she called them. 
<br/>
But these "errands" were quite frequent. And happened two times a day. Sometimes his father never came back for almost a week. 
<br/>

<br/>
Where has his father gone now? And what about his mother? 
<br/>
He wasn't just going to stay there and do absolutley nothing until his parents showed up. 
<br/>
He put his large feet on the hard wood floor, pushed himself from the bed, and walk woozely to the hall. 
<br/>
He thought he could go to his parents bedroom and see if they were not caught up on their sleep. 
<br/>
They did go to a dance for a couple of hours, but two hours would not be enough to get behind on slumber. 
<br/>
Without thinking any further, he decided to go to the room anyway. 
<br/>

<br/>
He walked down the hall from his room and turned left on a bend in the hall and saw something statingly odd... 
<br/>
There were blood spots on the wood floor, all of them as wide as acorns. 
<br/>
But these acorn sized things were everywhere. They led to his parents bedroom! 
<br/>
Khimada's eyes were no longer heavy with tiredness. His stomach twisted and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up. 
<br/>
What happened? Was his mother's nose bleeding again? But her nose didn't bleed THAT bad. 
<br/>

<br/>
He hurried across the blood battered hallway, trying to figure out what this was all about. 
<br/>
As he reached his parent's bedroom, the door was wide open, and he saw what was there...  <img src="/web/20050514144718im_/http://dwarvenblacksmith.com/ipw-web/bulletin/bb/images/smiles/shock.gif" alt="Shock1" border="0"/> 
<br/>

<br/>
His father lie on the floor face down with his hand streched out and a puddle of blood around his chest. He had a bloody laceration on his back, near the spine. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada felt as if he was going to wet himself. The hairs on his neck stood up higher and straighter. 
<br/>
And looked up to the bed to see it drenched in blood, and his mother, lay half under the green covers with a deep cut visible on her head. There were likely to have been more wounds on her than that. 
<br/>
Above her were bright glowing writings on the walls, that looked like some strange launguage. The writing was as red as his parent's blood. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada backed away slowly, trying to make sense of what was happening in front of his eyes. 
<br/>
He fell back, catching himself with his shakey hands. 
<br/>
He panted heavily, feeling sick, then he let out fast groans and whimpers. 
<br/>
Then let out a blood curling scream. 
<br/>

<br/>
He stood up, looking around the hall to see if the killer was near and out to kill him as well. 
<br/>
He ran clumsily down the hall heading down the creaky stairs, and into the small kitchen, where a door to the outside was. 
<br/>

<br/>
Without thinking he opened the door and left it open when he ran fast as a stout Dwarf could go, feeling his adridaline pumping in his veins and arteries. 
<br/>

<br/>
The stone street was covered with pedestrians and supply wagons, their jolly horses galloping along carrying food and weapons to the front. Armed guards with spears and chain mail walk across the place. 
<br/>

<br/>
He ran past the people in his bare feet and pajamas. The guards and villagers stared at him strangley as the unproperly clothed Dwarf shot down the street to the Riverside guards quarters. It housed the 1st Brill Militia Battalion, which 60% of them were Dwarven immagrints. Most of the Dwarves that moved to Brill or any other village, got a job as a town guard, since combat is their main profession. 
<br/>

<br/>
Brainde, a Dwarven guard who was on duty around the barracks, saw Khimada running down towards him. He laughed at the sight of him. He liked Khimada, and was friends with his family. 
<br/>
As Khimada screached to a halt right before him, Brainde spoke. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Khimada, my boy! You missed church today! Well I suppose it's no big fret, since you should be wondering about the Titans instead of this "Light" thing. Ha ha ha." Brainde laughed, and expected Khimada to laugh with him as he usually did, but Khimada looked very pale and frightened. 
<br/>
"What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost." Brainde wondered, scratching his black beard. He kept on smiling. 
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, he kept on smiling until Khimada leaned over with his hands on his knees and shot his digested dinner on the ground.  <img src="/web/20050514144718im_/http://dwarvenblacksmith.com/ipw-web/bulletin/bb/images/smiles/344.gif" alt="Spy" border="0"/> Yellowish, green vomit poured out of his mouth and he made burping and gasping sounds. Brainde jumped back. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Woa! Ya alright laddy?" He was not smiling anymore, the foot that he landed on when he jumped was the only foot he had on the ground. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada drew back breath that he lost when vomiting, then stood up shaking. 
<br/>
"My, my, my..." He stuttered, out of his awful tasting mouth. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Your what?" Brainde put his foot down, trying not to make it land in Khimada's puddle of digested potatoes and rice. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Mo-mo-mother- an- and father!" Khimada shaked even harder. 
<br/>

<br/>
"What laddy? What happened?" Brainde was getting as worried as Khimada was when he saw the bloodstains in the hall. 
<br/>
The villagers and other guards were starting to worry too, for they had been listening on the conversation. 
<br/>

<br/>
"MOTHER AND FATHER ARE DEAD!!!!!" Khimada passed out, falling back on the stone ground. Brainde thought he was going to crack his head open on the street. 
<br/>

<br/>
Brainde started to make sense of what was happening in front of him. 
<br/>
He looked around him to see puzzled guards and worried people biting their nails. 
<br/>

<br/>
He then looked back on the young lad, lieing on the ground with a puddle of sloppy wet vomit at his feet. 
<br/>
He thought of somthing to do. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Albert! Beazle!" Brainde called to a Human guard and a Dwarf guard. 
<br/>
"Check his house! Spread the word! Get somebody to take care of the poor lad! I'm going to go get the Chief!" He finished then, all the guards shot in the directions they needed to go, and carried out the jobs they needed to fulfill.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: darkred"><span style="font-weight: bold">~Khimada</span></span></span>

<br/>
The Honest Truth 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Brill, 
<br/>
That Same day... 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Feeling his life in him again, Khimada opened his eyes half way and was still shocked about the dream he had. 
<br/>
It was an awful dream, the worst he had ever had. It seemed so real too. 
<br/>

<br/>
He rolled over to his chest on his bed, trying to feel the fabric sheets and- 
<br/>

<br/>
This wasn't fabric... 
<br/>
It was a leather sofa! He was not in his house! Where was he? He could still even taste stomach acid in his mouth. He threw an army quilt off of him and started rolling around trying to get off of the sofa and see what was going on. 
<br/>

<br/>
There stood a familiar bearded face, and a another Dwarf by a fireplace in a dark room. 
<br/>
The room had a bearskin blanket, a black stone floor, and a white stone wall all in one room. 
<br/>
The whole room would have been completely dark without the fireplace, for there were no windows. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada looked at the Dwarven Chief of militia, Chief Targonne Whitespear in his chain mail armor. But he couldn't recognize the other Dwarf in decrative clothing and two medals pinned on his jacket. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Khimada." Targonne put his head down and his hands behind his back. "I'm sorry about your parents." He muttered. The other Dwarf looked empithetic too, he tried to look away so he wouldn't look like a nobleman that was pitying him and looking down on Khimada. 
<br/>

<br/>
"No." Khimada groaned. "They can't be dead. It can't be true." He laid back and cried, fighting back as many sobs as he could, but the tears just kept on flowing, and flowing... 
<br/>

<br/>
"Let's leave this lad alone for a bit." Spearwhite stated to the other Dwarf. He followed the chief along to an open door and stopped at the six foot appearance of a Human carrying a paper, and coated in plate armor. 
<br/>
They were whispering a bit, and the human kept pointed at the paper, then handed it to the Chief. Khimada kept looking at this, watching their movement. 
<br/>
The Chief was puzzled by it for some reason, so he handed it to the other Dwarf who took it over-curiously. He read it and opened his eyes. Wide. 
<br/>

<br/>
"By the Titan's asses!" The Dwarf nearly dropped the paper. He looked over at Khimada who wasn't sobbing or crying as much anymore. The Human shot them a nod, and walked out of the room. 
<br/>
The unkown Dwarf slowley walked towards Khimada, then looked at Spearwhite who was eyeing them puzzled. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Chief could you please leave the room?" He requested, looking at the paper again. 
<br/>
"Yes sir." Whitespear said, then he walked out of the room with his iron boots clunking along. Khimada could tell that this stranger was higher ranking than the Chief. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Khimada!" He yelled almost too loudly. "I supposed you were wondering what the runes in your parents bedroom said." 
<br/>
Khimada thought about crying again when he mentioned his parents, but what were runes? 
<br/>
"Runes?" Khimada asked, sniffiling. 
<br/>

<br/>
"The red writing on the wall." He educated him with that single sentence. 
<br/>
Khimada remembered well, the blood red runes on the wall... 
<br/>

<br/>
"What did they say?" He was anxious to know now that he mentioned it. 
<br/>

<br/>
"They said, 'four spies dead, five remain, I countinue on my journey.' " He read the script. 
<br/>

<br/>
"What?!" Khimada was suprised almost. Was his father a spy? Was this the reason he kept training him? He could only ask more questions. 
<br/>

<br/>
"My father was a spy?" He stuttered, looking curious. He leaned foward to hear what else he was going to say. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Yes, he was an assassin for the DES." He explained, kneeling beside Khimada. 
<br/>

<br/>
"DES?" Khimada was amazed. His father was in the DES, which stood for the Dwarven Espionage Society! 
<br/>

<br/>
"He worked for me for ten years." He said, then stepping up to say somthing else. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Listen Khimada, your father was killed to prevent him from succeding from his mission. Those we're Orcish runes on the walls." He said. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada was overly puzzled. 
<br/>
"What mission?" He pondered out loud. 
<br/>

<br/>
"To break a naval blockade at the south sea." The Dwarf said. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Khimada, now that I have told you his secret mission, I have no choice but to conscript you to the DES." He crouched down beside Khimada. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada did not want to do this, he just wanted to live with his family, and get back to his life. He wanted to get back with his family.... 
<br/>
He didn't have a family..... It was gone..... 
<br/>
It was taken from him like candy from an infant. There was no way to get it back. No way.... 
<br/>

<br/>
"I.... I don't want to join the DES." He wimpered, knowing what the reply was going to be. 
<br/>

<br/>
He looked depressed himself. He was without a doubt an empithetic Dwarf, and didn't want Khimada to feel sorrow throughout the rest of his life. 
<br/>
"You have to." He said. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Who are you anyway?" Khimada wanted to know that, he lifted his tired body up from the sofa. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Colonel Daimias Redaxe of the DES, department of wartime sabotage." He stood up lifting up Khimada. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada was eager to get out of his grip. He did not like the touch of a strange Dwarf with a gloved hand. But he restrained himself. 
<br/>

<br/>
"I need you, young Khimada, to finish the job your father had started." Daimias ordered. "I need you to break the blockade." 
<br/>

<br/>
"What?!" Khimada screamed. How was he going to break an Orcish ship blockade with enough guns to blow his ashes to ashes. 
<br/>
"I cant do it!" He broke down and cried. Where was his mother who cheered him up by fixing him an apple pie, or some buttered bread. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Khimada, you aren't going to be alone on this. I have a plan." Daimias reassured. He put his hand on his shoulder, feeling the urge to lift him up with the hand. But the reassuring seemed to have done it's job. 
<br/>

<br/>
"I'm not going to be alone?" He raised his head from his hands that covered his tear ridden face. 
<br/>

<br/>
"No." Daimias smiled pleasantly. 
<br/>

<br/>
All Khimada wanted was his family, or some people who can be like family. 
<br/>
"Okay... I'll do it... no it's not okay..." Khimada wanted to cry some more. He was rocking himself on the ground. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Khimada, it will be okay." He smiled some more, and Khimada shot him a glance. "Trust me." 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada was looking right back at him this time. He got up. 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
"You'll be carried by wagon from here.... to the outskirts of here." Colonel Daimias directed. 
<br/>
They we're both in the map room, along with the Human wagon driver; Travis. 
<br/>

<br/>
He was pointing to a marked town on the map. The name, Tarren Mill was under the thick, bolded dot on the map. The map read that this town was four hours away. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Reports say that there is constant fighting in that town between the Orcish Blackrock Clan and the 67th Azeroth Infantry Division. The town has been bombarded by Orcish ship cannons and 80% of the town is in rubble." He was talking slow and smooth. 
<br/>

<br/>
"What do I do when I get there?" Khimada asked nervously. 
<br/>

<br/>
"Don't get jittery kid." Daimias insisted. "When you get there, you will find a man who can take you on a rowboat to blow up at least four ships so that the blockade can be weakened in the slightest bit." 
<br/>

<br/>
"How will I blow up those with a rowboat?!" Khimada was enraged. 
<br/>

<br/>
"You will cover the rowboat up with this." He pulled out a very large green sheet. It was so large, that it could cover almost all the room. 
<br/>

<br/>
"You clap twice..." Daimias clapped twice like his body was repeating his voice. 
<br/>

<br/>
The sheet suddendly dissapeared, and part of his body was not visible! Was this some kind of invisibility sheet? 
<br/>

<br/>
"Woa!" Khimada's heart almost stopped completely. He was defenantly going to use some of the DES' finest equipment! 
<br/>

<br/>
"Clap twice again, and it reappears." He clapped again, and it did just exactly what he had explained. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada was amazed. He thought he would never live to see this sort of thing. 
<br/>

<br/>
Daimias pulled out a large bomb with a fuse. 
<br/>
"These are the things you will be blowing up the ships with. They are extra explosive, and have a special formula that sets things on fire when they explode. And I'll tell ya that they float in the water." Daimias explained everything carefully and smoothly. 
<br/>
"Get your stuff on. It's in the closet right over there." He pointed at the door behind them. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada hesitated not. He walked towards the door, then opened it. 
<br/>
Inside was full espianage/combat armor. It was black leather, and included a hood, body armor, pauldrons, gloves, boots, and leggings. There was a belt with a shortsword and a hand axe attached to them. The belt had eight notches in them that held silvery throwing knives. 
<br/>

<br/>
Khimada was without a doubt, going to use some of the finest equipment in the DES. He was about to get on this equipment, and he was going to do it without question. 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Who on Azeroth would kill them...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: darkred"><span style="font-weight: bold">~Khimada</span></span></span>
