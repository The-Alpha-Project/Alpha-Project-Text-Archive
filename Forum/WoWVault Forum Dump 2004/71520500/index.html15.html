				Ok, here's my quick little review..
 <br> 
 <br> Here's my background..
 <br> 
 <br> AC was my first MMORPG.  I played it off and on since Beta in '99.  In fact, a friend and I are playing it now (because there's nothing better out).  I played many other MMORPGs (Including DAoC, AC2, Earth and Beyond, Planetside, SWG and a few others).  Basically, I haven't found one that's as good as AC (IMHO).
 <br> 
 <br> Now, how do I like WoW?
 <br> 
 <br> I think that it's a lot of fun.  I really like the idea that questing is how you level (for the most part).
 <br> 
 <br> So far, my highest character is level 18 and I've got a second character which is almost 15 (I'm playing him now).  I've got about 76 hours play time.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm actually really looking forward to getting some friends into Beta (or going into open Beta).  I love playing MMORPGs with friends.  I don't normally group with strangers because my friends and I like to use voice chat.  For that reason, I've pretty much soloed most of my time.
 <br> 
 <br> Overall, WoW is a really  nice game.  However, since it's beta and not all of the content is in yet, it is definately lacking in a few areas.
 <br> 
 <br> First off, they are still tweaking the XP and the rest system.  Due to recent changes, the XP you get from quests is not enough to level continuously without grinding.  Luckily this will be addressed.
 <br> 
 <br> PvP still needs a lot of work.  On the PvE servers, PvP players can run around and kill NPCs and basically annoy PvE players.  Again, this is going to be addressed.  Changes are coming with the next patch to help fix the problem.
 <br> 
 <br> Basically, there are a lot of little things which still need to be added.  The game can definately use more quests (for specific classes, races and levels) and all of the Tradeskills can use a little bit more work (in terms of new recipes and tweaking of existing recipes).  So far Battlegrounds, Hunters, boat and zeplin travel haven't even been implemented yet.
 <br> 
 <br> Overall, WoW is looking vary promising.  If the higher level content (40 - 60ish) is the same quality as the lower level stuff and Blizzard adds all of the promised features, I have no doubt that WoW will absolutely blow a lot of people away.
 <br> 
 <br> The thing I like the most about WoW is that is has so much promise.  It is going to be released more stable, tested and feature rich than any other MMORPG in recent memory (like the last 4 years).  This means that the Live team will not need to spend all of their time fixing the game.  I can't wait to see what the game will look like when open Bata and Retail arrive.  I also can't wait to see what the live team comes up with once we are in Retail.
 <br> 
 <br> GP
 <br> 
 <br> P.S.
 <br> 
 <br> One other thing.  Just so that you guys know, Blizzard is working really really hard on WoW.  Every push brings new stuff and tons of fixes to things we had problems with the push before.  In fact, they have completely redesigned areas (including cities) several times just to make them better.  They're not affraid to try things (even things that are drastically differnt) just to see if they will work better in game.

				Very simple short review....
 <br> 
 <br> I found this game to be the only game that I liked to actually play the low levels.  All other games I've tried (ac1, ac2, L2, DAoC) I never really liked the low levels and just wanted to level up fast to actually enjoy the game.
 <br> 
 <br> There's so many quests to do when you start out.  Most of them are, kill x creatures and get x items from those creatures then come back, style.. but it's still fun getting your rewards.
 <br> 
 <br> The graphics are really top notch.  My video card can use pixel shaders and with them turned on, the water effects are amazing.  And the funny thing is, there's no slowdown lag near water.  Every other game I lose fps near water when pixel shaders are turned on.
 <br> 
 <br> One thing I didn't like about it is that for the different races, a warlock is the same for all.  So a gnome warlock has the same exact spells as an undead warlock, same names even.  I wish they would make them a little bit different.. like give one race more attack power but the other race faster casting speed.. something like that.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> In the end.. this game is more finished in its current state than the game i'm currently playing now, Lineage 2.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm going to be one of the hundreds of thousands going to make the switch to WoW when it hits retail.

				I'll take a stab here.
 <br> 
 <br> I have tried most of the MMORPG's out right now. Some I got to high levels, some only mid-levels. Games I have played are: AC1, AC2, AO, DAOC, SWG, EQ, FFXI, L2, Horizons.
 <br> 
 <br> I have only been playing WoW for about 2-3 weeks. I have a 16 Paladin and a 12 Warrior. I'd be much higher but I've been very casual and I have some other alts in the &lt;10 range. I recently started a Mage and I have a Rogue I am going to work on.
 <br> 
 <br> I'll rate some of the systems and I'll probably post again when a new patch comes in, because things can change.
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics: They are in the Warcraft III style. If you played WC III and saw the full screen scenes, cut scenes (not movies) you get the idea of the STYLE. It's not photo-like, it has  the use of bright colors and a cartoony look. I happen to like this look and it suits the game. The best thing is the game doesn't run choppy or laggy, like AC2 and AO did at times, especially around lots of people. There are amazing Cities like Ironforge and Stormwind that are zoneless, complete with shops, some with upstairs and downtstairs. These shops are decorated, have burning candles or bubbling potions, pictures on the wall, animalskin rugs, etc. The detail is fantastic. In the snowy areas players and animals leave footprints in the snow and your breath steams out from your mouth. The game uses pixel shaders for the water, which looks good but it isn't done yet (water effects as per the devs). There is also another effect where things shine in the sunlight, like glare on road pavers or smoothed areas of snow or ice. The game runs great and screenshots and movies don't do it justice. Spell effects are good but amazingly so and animations are smooth.
 <br> 
 <br> UI and Movement: A good solid interface that I think is still being tweaked a bit. It's similar to DAOC and is XML-able. I had no problems figuring stuff out.
 <br> WASD is the default. I don't think I remapped anything. Enter to chat. R to reply. You can change the size of the chat text and make new windows. You can also put a transparency around text and change the color. The default is clear, but it's actually a window. You can swim UP and DOWN into water (some quests have parts where you need to go underwater), you can jump. There is a full screen map that is not too detailed and a smaller map inside the compass in the upper right. I would like to note that this map is zoomable but DOES NOT SHOW MOBS or PLAYERS. It does show group members. There are also little notch waypoints in the corner for your corpse or nearby POI's you have discovered. As you discover new areas you get XP and it fills in the world map for you. Entering a dungeon changes the little map and it does map out for your as you walk through.
 <br> 
 <br> Sound: Excellent music that changes with the area. No combat music. Terrific ambient sounds of birds, wind, wolves, people, anvils clanking, etc. Combat sounds are good, with different weapons making different sounds. Swords clank, Hammers make a thud, etc.
 <br> 
 <br> Quests: So many quests! Some are simple and some are multiple step quests. Some require you to go into a dungeon, some are delivery, escorts, kill tasks, collections. I had a quest to go to a farm and steal 10 pumpkins. There were bad guys all over the place. Then, another part of the quest, I was to deliver this laced pumpkin pie to a prisoner in the basement of an Inn. I went down there, there was a guard and this prisoner. I gave him the pie and he thanked me for the food, he then changed into some kind of creature, he then groaned and died. Quests take you through most of your level, you'll always have several quests going at once. The quests seemed to push you further out into the world, although very slowly. I have yet to see any quests like AC1, where you needed 2 groups to move levers, etc (Like Virindi Amulet or Shendolain). Overall they are really good, only some annoyed me (drop rates). Rewards consist always of some value of XP, cash and many times a reward. It could be a weapon, piece of armor, food or even a buff or new skill. I had to do a quest with my Paladin to get a rez spell. The armor or weapon may or may NOT be better than what you can buy or loot for your level. Some quest items you may use, some you may not.
 <br> 
 <br> Classes and combat: I have only dabbled in some, because I haven't gotten past 20. I'm finding the Paladin is decent, but not great. They have no way to do a ranged attack. It seems they are more backup healer and support than anything else. Their skills are mostly protects that last like 20 seconds. I seem to have like 3 attacks and then 20 buffs/protects. The pally uses Mana like a mage or cleric. The warrior I have can use more weapons and is very interesting. A red bar, called rage increases as you fight. This becomes like your mana for your skills. Once you have enough you can then kick off skills. I really can't wait for the Hunter class to be put in. That's what this game needs. There's no real ranged class, aside from mages. There are bows and powder type guns but the hunter class is THE class to be if you are a range freak. I think that will change the game a lot.
 <br> 
 <br> PvP: I didn't PVP yet so I don't know how it is. All I know is that Mages are pretty uber right now (IMHO) and range kicks ass this game for PVP.
 <br> 
 <br> Overall feel: I have to say I look forward to logging on. I haven't felt that way in a long time (since AC1) about a game. There are some things that make me say &quot;Hey, this kind of reminds me of DAOC, but this is like AC2 and this I have never seen before&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> Trust me, it's not a clone of anything I have played, but elements remind you of other games.

				Ive been in about a week and would like to post my thoughts here.  I come from a heavy MMORPG background, either testing or playing all of them.  4 years in EQ, 5 in UO, 1 in SWG, FFXI, AC, AC2, AO, COH, you name it.
 <br> 
 <br> I was impressed with the learning curve.  I had not read anything about the game and went thru char creation and got into the game smoothly.  I quickly figured out that NPCs with a ! over their head gave me quests.  The UI is very straightforward and user friendly.  The quests were clear and understandable.  Skill training after levelling is very intuitive.  Took me a little while to learn how to aquire a tradeskill but was very easy after that.
 <br> 
 <br> I like the soloability of it (my friends didnt get in the beta...yet).  Up to level 14 (tauren druid) I found hunting slow but steady progress.  Not flying thru levels which is fine by me.
 <br> 
 <br> The tradeskills are interesting in they use a combo of gathered resources (using various resource gathering skills) combined with some store bought stuff.  The tradeskills level up nicely with no chance to fail.
 <br> 
 <br> The global map is very well done and the travelling via the paid transport methods is very handy and astetically pleasing at the same time.
 <br> 
 <br> The zones scale in difficulty nicely as you move further out from where you appear.
 <br> 
 <br> Overall I give it a 9 out of 10 for overall enjoyment, playability, depth, graphics, etc.
 <br> 
 <br> Its going to be my game of choice when released.  I have high faith in blizzards ability to make a very solid game, ive played all of their games.  It wont be released on time, but it will be released working.  (Unlike the current game im in /snicker).
 <br> 
 <br> Thumbs up.

				I just got into Phase 3 a week or two ago.  I've played UO, AC, EQ, DAoC, AC2, AO, E&amp;B, Shadowbane, EVE, FFIX, and maybe one or two others that I forgot.
 <br> 
 <br> This is the first MMORPG in a long time to really pull me in.  The last one I played for any time at all was AC2, and the last one I really got into and played a lot was DAoC.  I see myself playing WoW for a LONG time.  I agree with just about all the positives that people have listed so far.  My favorite thing is that I haven't yet (lvl 14 Night Elf Druid) felt like I was just runnin on a treadmill.  There are always quests to work on, or new places to go and explore.  At least the trade skills I've chosen (Skinning and Leatherworking) are fun and fit well with the adventuring.  It's nice to be able to hunt beasts for experience and loot, then skin them and use the leather to make things.
 <br> 
 <br> Can't really think of anything else to say that hasn't already been said.  I love this game.  I'd give it aprox. a 9.5/10.

				WoW in a Nutshell
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">My Experience:</span>
 <br> 5 years playing at least one of these: AO, EQ, UO, SB, FFXI.  For WoW beta at the time of this writing I have a level 39 Warlock on the PvE server and a 26th Mage on the PvP server.  Also 5+ characters under lvl 12.
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">PROS:</span>
 <br> -The most artistically stunning and vibrant world ever seen in a MMORPG, or any Computer game, nothing even comes close.  The world builders have done something truly amazing with this game.  The shear number of different and interesting places to visit is mind-boggling.
 <br> -A design model that concentrates on fast-paced battles with multiple enemies rather than the slow 1 mob at a time approach.
 <br> -Extremely impressive instanced super-dungeons that are fun dungeon romps with a group of select friends.
 <br> -Fantastic GUI.
 <br> -Excellent quest system with quests everywhere.  About 40% of your experience comes just from completing quests.
 <br> -The best crafting system ever seen in a MMORPG, yes better than SWG.  Crafting depends on getting the right materials, not endless trial and error.
 <br> -Nice Auction House system that works just like ebay.  Better than FFXI's.
 <br> -Great Talent system that is used to make two chars of the same class different.  (At the time of this writing only 2 classes have their talents implemented.)  The talent system is very similar to the skill system of Diablo 2.
 <br> -A beast-flight (gryphon, bat, etc) transportation system that is working surprisingly well with the gameplay.  Even at high levels, I find myself using this service to travel around the world at least once per play session.  Not to mention the incredibly impressive tour it gives you of the traveled areas.
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">CONS:</span>
 <br> -WoW doesn't add anything innovative to the genre.  Pretty much everything found in WoW has been done in a previous MMORPG.
 <br> -Arguably too much of a solo oriented gameplay.  Too many &quot;best-to-do-solo&quot; quests.
 <br> -Technically speaking, a slightly dated graphic engine.  Where this really shows its ugly head is the non-transparent water and the very low poly count character models.
 <br> -A somewhat lack of challenging gameplay because of WoW's almost non-existent death penalty and the moderately fast leveling rate.  The game is arguably too easy.  Time played = level.
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion:</span>
 <br> I'm being very honest here, WoW is easily the best MMORPG I have ever played.  The game is addicting as hell.  The game, in Phase 2 when I started, was far more complete than most current MMORPGs released years ago.  Never have I been so excited to go home and play a game since my first days of UO.  Personally, the thing that does it for me is the incredibly artistic world design.  I can't believe the effort the world builders have done for this title.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ2 aside, WoW will blow all existing MMORPGs out of the water.  WoW meets Blizzard goal of just making a fun MMORPG.  Of course, EQ2 is starting to look even better, but that&#8217;s outside of the scope of this review.
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Score: 9/10</span>
 <br> It would of been a perfect score if not for, of course, the cons I listed.
						<p><span class="SignatureTitle">-----signature-----</span>
						<div class="SignatureText">
						62th NT Doc, AO, underrated game
 <br> 55th Elf BW, SB, great game that was just too buggy to play
 <br> 35th Erudite Cleric, EQ
 <br> 27th Hume War/Monk, FFXI, lvl grind got ridiculous
 <br> 48th Mage(PvP), 39th Warlock(PvE), WoW Beta, pwns all of them

 <br> 
 <br> <i>I thought I'd post my experience in WOW so far, coming from the perspective of a hard-core DAOC PVPer. I havent done much PVP in WoW yet, so these are really more PvE thoughts, and experiences. Hope it explains what we mean we we say this game has good solid content. Anyways... 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> If you like content, you'l llike WoW. 
 <br> 
 <br> I am by NO MEANS a Blizzard fanboi..i have rarely if ever played a blizzard game, i think i tried a warcraft3 demo once, and enjoyed it to some extent, RTS isnt really my thing. 
 <br> 
 <br> I also loved DAOC for a long, long time ..I have a few lvl 50s, and my main is RR9 , and I have 2 RR4ish toons. I have all the artifacts i need on both of my toons i actually play (SB and Wizard), and am ML10 on my SB. I have played the game out. NF pretty much sucks IMO, so I am bored with DAOC now ..I'm all out of PVE content, and PVP is lacking. 
 <br> 
 <br> When I first heard about WOW coming out, i was't impressed. I laughted at all the Blizzard fanbois, and made smartass comments when they professed their undying love for all things BLizzard. I looked at the cartoony graphics, and thought myself above them. Tought it wasnt gritty enough, or realistic enough looking. 
 <br> 
 <br> THEN, my friends got into Beta, and told me about how much they liked it. One person in particular told me &quot;Hey man, you would love this game&quot;. So i begged on my local DAOC server board for someone to please give me their Beta invite , if they weren't gonna use it. Someone did ( &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 ), and I tried the game. 
 <br> 
 <br> The game is phenomenal. The PVE content, even at low levels is actualy F U N ! The crafting is F U N ! The instanced dungeons are done RIGHT, and are also very F U N ! 
 <br> 
 <br> The way the quests are done, it keeps you moving to new areas, and lets you explore the world at a nice pace. Get bored with an area? ..go to a new one, and start a new quest track. The content pushes you along, keeps you gaining XP, and levels, or skills, or whatever, then it moves you to the next level area, and lets you get your feet wet with some easy quests to start, then you get the tougher ones, and eventually the real hard ones, and elite quests where you need a solid grp, and a couple hours to kill. 
 <br> 
 <br> For example, there is an area called Westfall, this is where Humans(and other alliance people who come to Stormwind area) go around lvl 12-18ish. Aftert doing some simple quests, learning the layout, I was given more advanced quests, and finally I got the &quot;Kill Edward Van CLeef&quot;, and &quot;Underground Assault&quot; quests. 
 <br> Both of these are completed in the instanced dungeon in the zone. 
 <br> 
 <br> We got a solid grp together (we were told we were too low level, but we were a good grp of decent players) and went to the dungeon, and spent about 3 hours doing a dungeon crawl. Now, i don't mean running around to different camps in a dungeon, and blindly killing crap. I mean we worked our way through, opening several doors along the way,(I had to use my Mage Unlocking spell on a door even), methodically getting deeper and deeper, untill we got to the final area (which i wont spoil for you), and we defeated 3 mini bosses along the way, and finally killed Edward Van Cleef. We got lots of GREAT drop Items, and tons of sell loot, plus made a decent bit of actual cash. I made enough Xp to make almost all of level 19, plus when i turned in the quests, i made another 3rd of a level on top of that! 
 <br> 
 <br> This game HAS content out the wazzoo, and we still have 6 months of beta testing to go, this game is great, and I would suggest it to anyone who is sick of the same ole, same ole to try it out on release. 
 <br> 
 <br> Hope that helps.

 <br> 
 <br> <i>Well I have been busy playing WoW beta. I can't even tell you how much I played it in the last week. I would estimate near 75-85 hours. I currently have a love-hate relationship with the game. 
 <br> 
 <br> It has it points where I become totally frustrated with the whole quest thing. It has made it to basically where no one wants to group. You run into several different situations with the quest thing. Some quests require 20-30 drops to be collected. So you decide to try to solo them. It doesn't quite work. It is not that the mobs are high level because most are even cons, but there is so much aggro if every quest camp that it never fails you get aggro. You find yourself on corpse runs alot, and figure you will get a partner. Now you have to collect 40-60 of them between two of you. So you say great. It will be great xp for the both of us. Not really. With even two people the xp ratio is horrible. You get way better xp going solo, but who cares you live longer, and collect your drops. There is a catch though. You spam LFG for Weapons of Choice quest for 15 minutes before someone finally answers. You think to yourself finally. You wait for them to show up, and you set the loot to round robin (take turns looting for the most part). Once they get there they say thanks for the group, and they tell you they only need 10 more while you still need 29. So they help you kill, and they get there 10, and you still have 23 to go because the round robin doesnt mean that you get the quest drops every time. They make up some lame excuse that they have to log. They use there Hearthstone, and port back to there bind point. Once again you are out there trying to solo with aggro mobs everywhere. Eventually after grouping about 5 times you get your required drops to finish the quest. You look at your xp bar after grinding for 5 hours with little progress. So you cash in your quest, and find a new one to do. You follow the same steps, and become really frustrated at times. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> So you tell yourself that the quests are basically a waste of time. So you go exploring, and look for mobs around your level were you can just grind xp for several hours. For the most part there are no areas like this which forces you to quest again. Some quests require a full group even though mobs are basically 3-4 levels above you. Just imagine splitting xp 5 ways on a evenly conned mob. It is horrid. I can basically solo for 100 xp per kill. In a group of 5 I may get 35 xp per kill if I am lucky. It is split evenly no matter if someone is afk, or doing all the damage. 
 <br> 
 <br> What I would like to see is the quest collection amount of items lowered, with maybe less xp reward. If you don't complete the quest within a certain amount of time the items drop from your inventory. So this would help the grouping situation. People would actually form groups, and go together to get the required 5-10 items, and complete the quest together instead of people being at various levels when joining a group, and leaving once they get there items, because they know that the xp sucks being split 5 ways, and why would they want to stay. 
 <br> 
 <br> Also another idea is that any quest item that drops is shared throughout the group. So if a quillboar tusk drops it automatically goes into the inventory of everyone in the group. No more having to collect 200 tusks for a group of 5 which means killing 2000 quillboars along with killing any Hyfengas, Stormsnouts, or Thunderhawks which decide to aggro you every other kill. I think this way it would encourage groups. 
 <br> 
 <br> Just do a /who and I think you would be amazed at how many people are solo. I bet out of 50 people only about 6 are actually grouped. That is pathetic. 
 <br> 
 <br> On the upside the last patch added a few features which I think have improved the game. Just unfortunately I am playing a Warlock and my Talents haven't been implemented yet. So yes, beta is probably still going to be going on for a while. With the warriors, and mages I have spoken with they have been totally estatic about the Talent system. From what I have gathered it is something like Virtues in Ultima, and Realm Abilities in DAoC. It definately sets you apart from other characters, and makes it so not every Warrior is a carbon copy of each other. I can't wait to see what my Warlock gets. 
 <br> 
 <br> Another feature I am so glad they implemented was auction houses. In every bank there is an auction NPC to where you can place items up for auction, or buyout, and browse, or buy items too. It reminds me of the bazaar in SWG's, or basically it is Ebay inside of the WoW world for in-game items. It is very user friendly. No more sitting in town spamming the shout channel to sell things when I could be out farming xp. 
 <br> 
 <br> One more feature I like is the ability to link any item in a chat channel. So for example if I am grouped, and I loot a Battle Slayer Uber Axe of the Mighty I can let every see the stats without having to type it all out. I simply pull up my inventory, and shift-click on the item and it makes it a hyper link in my message so every sees the same thing I see when I check out the stats. I have always dreamed about this feature for a long time. 
 <br> 
 <br> Another cool feature is you can see the last time in exact hours and minutes when a guild member last logged on. So no more wondering if someone is still playing or not. 
 <br> 
 <br> Also with the last patch they have basically decided to get rid of the rest system. Of course I never saw it in its original state since I started beta in Phase 3. Now basically you get 1 bub of xp at double xp for every 8 hours you are logged out. It isn't much, but I still see it as free xp. I am sure it will change 10 more times during this beta because no one is ever happy with what they decide. 
 <br> 
 <br> Okay, I just remembered something. So I have busted my rear end to get to level 20 to earn my second pet which is a Succubus. Let me tell you something. They are very cool looking. That is it though. I think they wear no armor. My succubus dies almost every time to an even level mob, and than I have to spend 5 minutes waiting for it to med up. Yes they slowed the heal time of our pets, and it takes forever now. If my first level pet could dual my second level pet it would probably have 3/4 of its life left compared to my second pet. I /pray every day that maybe Warlock talents will fix this problem. So for now my Succubus is just for show, and my blue pet is used for all battles. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> With all this I have still totally become addicted to this game, and will be buying it on the day of release. Of course beta is still going to be for awhile, and I know alot of things will be fixed, or changed before it goes retail. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Until my next update....

 <br> 
 <br> <i>Well... I got my beta invite last Friday. So for those of you still waiting on invites, obviously they are still inviting, so hope is not lost!  
 <br> 
 <br> I'm going to keep my comments short, since I only have a few days experience in the game, and my comments are basically First Impressions, Only. 
 <br> 
 <br> Pros: 
 <br> ~Probably the best game I've encountered in the last two years of dismal MOG betas / launches.  
 <br> ~Animations are very well done. 
 <br> ~Quests are way better than DAoC tasking, yet similar. (More story, better rewards, and not just &quot;Go kill X mobs, The End&quot;) 
 <br> ~Loot / Reward system is very good. 
 <br> ~Combat is simple, yet fun. 
 <br> ~Progression is at a decent rate, so far (Level 13 ATM). 
 <br> ~Death penalty is perfect. (If you push the envelope, you die a lot, which can be annoying within itself... no need to add extra annoying penalties.  ) 
 <br> ~A wide variety of environments encountered, already. 
 <br> ~Flying between areas on a Griffon Rocks (Way better than DAoC horses... haven't tried other mounts yet). 
 <br> ~The music is awesome. 
 <br> ~The sounds are well done (Going into a mine or large Hall, echos) 
 <br> ~Perfect gore. Not overly bloody for a family game, yet some shown (Best seen in 1st Person view). 
 <br> ~Server recoveries are FAST. When the server crashes it's usually back within minutes! (Very impressed with that) 
 <br> 
 <br> Cons: 
 <br> ~Bit Torrent Sucks. (Glad we can buy a box) 
 <br> ~The current beta community is mostly full of eliteists. (Most are from earlier phases and ignore n00bs, even ones like me that don't beg... not really Blizzard's fault) 
 <br> ~The Tutorial is terrible. (Basically &quot;tips&quot; that pop up AFTER you try to do something) 
 <br> ~Most Character / Mob models definitely need more polys (Sorry, I don't mind the look Blizzard is going for, but I don't like blocky models either). 
 <br> ~24 Hour clock is annoying, yet, I conceed, not a game-breaker. 
 <br> ~No Doors to open and close. (Minor, but annoying that all new MOGs are doing this) 
 <br> ~Vendors and many NPCs stand in one fricken spot doing nothing. (Would like to see some idle animations, at least.. and maybe some slight wandering) 
 <br> ~So far, the only Dungeons have been small mines / small caves. Nothing Epic or Instanced, yet (As, of Level 13). 
 <br> 
 <br> Overall, I think WoW is very well done, and it's nice to see a trend of &quot;good MOGs&quot;, instead of the CRAP we've had over the last couple of years.  
 <br> 
 <br> Regards,

 <br> 
 <br> <i>I play on a slow modem connection because of where I live and no high speed available. 
 <br> 
 <br> I went to a friends house and downloaded the beta program because he had a DSL connection. I then went home and started playing WOW June 29. Character creation was easy and fast. Newbie area was set up nice and game play was pretty smooth. I have been very surprise at how well it plays on my modem connection only get lag in main towns and near the end of rides between cities. Also get some lag duing peak usage time in my area also but it has never been so bad the the game would be even close to unplayable. I find the quests to be very nice and helpful but sometimes overwelming so many choices hehe. I have been playing a warlock I'm lvl 13 now and this class seems to be well thought out and balanced. I have enjoyed the game more than I have enjoyed a game in a very long time. 
 <br> 
 <br> Now some dislikes about the game. First newbies should enter game near their trainers so they know where they are at. Mine was almost hidden and had a hard time finding her. They only give you your first few lvl of spells so should be easy to find. My next beef is incomplete basic documentation. Example it tells you how to get into a group but menu doesn't give you option to leave a group nor does the game tell you how to do someting as basic as this. 
 <br> 
 <br> I also have two suggestions when the game goes live. First make the newbie areas bigger for launch and faster mob respawn all those low lvl chars in those small areas is going to be tough. Secondly I would up the respawn rate in the low lvl quest mobs since you will have so many people after them. I find these areas even at 13 very crowded even at 4 am in the morning CDT. Also the 24 hour clock everyone keeps talking about, I can tell no difference between night or day its the same all the time so day night cycle as it stands now is meaningless. 
 <br> 
 <br> I'm very happy with the game and hope it only continue to get better.

 <br> <i>Okay this is going to be as honest an opinion as your going to get. 
 <br> 
 <br> 1. Game looks amazing. Graphics are exactley what you would expect from Blizzard. Remember all the cool little details there were when you zoomed in on War 3. Well all the little things from flags moving to smoke blowing in the wind is all here nothing is untouched. Very well done and will give it a 5 out of 5 
 <br> 
 <br> 2. Gameplay is fantastic. I am a real mmo nerd. So i am giving this from an mmo perspective. I love quests i love doing them more then camping. However people saying that camping monsters doesn't exsist is lying you can camp the dungeons and just kill monsters all you want. It may not be as productive as completing quests but hey to each there own. Characters are really cool. I love the armors and the fantasy feel the game brings out. Battles are excellent and really well thought out. I give this a 4 out of 5. Reason for the 4 is the character models can be beefed up a bit. 
 <br> 
 <br> 3. Sound in this game is phenomanal. Just trust me on this i don't want to spoil anything but a 5 out of 5 is needed here. 
 <br> 
 <br> 4. Overall. I am going to be honest I have played DAOC, AC, SWG, SB, Horizons, FF 11. World of Warcraft is polished and running beautifully. They need to stress test servers and add there other class. This game has more in it right now then alot of these games combined. AC has more content though. HAHA. Anyhow I can say this to everyone this game will be around for a long time. It will be entertaining not only after you make level cap but beyond. I have always had faith in Blizzard and once again they have not let me down. I will be first in line to purchase this game on release day. As a tester and a fellow community member all I can say is I hope release is soon because I want to tear this game up. Hope this helps all who wonder what this game is like 
 <br> 
 <br> I am back to the land of azeroth now. Later. 
 <br> 
 <br> (ed...later post on same thread...)
 <br> 
 <br> I find the loot excellent i love picking my own loot from quests makes it so I don't have to worry about getting crap or looking up the quests on the net to find the ones that give the best items that suit my needs. 
 <br> 
 <br> I will agree on the character visuals as i said there not stellar but i feel they will become more flushed out as the game get nearer to release. 
 <br> 
 <br> AC loot system is better however its only better because its had many years to improve on it. When building an mmo from scratch you can't expect millions of items right off the bat. I will commend Blizzard with having so many items right off the bat though. I know they will be adding alot more as well. I don't think all the weopons look the same but that's my opinion. 
 <br> 
 <br> I want to stress that i am not a blizzard fanboy i am however an mmo fanboy and will defend this genre of game. 
 <br> 
 <br> I can honestly say without a doubt that what blizzard has done is create what they always have done. BUILD A GAME AROUND A FUN FACTOR. This game is fun and does not give you a chance to breath as it wraps you in. You rarely will find a beta tester who doesn't spend most of the free time playing it. Even if they hate the game they still put insane amounts of time in. There is a reason. Anyhow discuss.

 <br> 
 <br> <i>I am not a professional writer, or game player for that matter, so please take this review with a grain of salt! These are just my impressions of the game so far. 
 <br> 
 <br> I just hit level 16 last night with my paladin. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Combat: The combat in WoW reminds me alot of AC1 for some reason. Not only is it fast paced and often hectic, you must pay attention when in a group and fighting multiple mobs. I have been in many groups and gotten &quot;wiped&quot; out from the monsters because of poor decisions/strategy. Combat feels like more then just sitting there pushing a button. It is very interactive and almost arcade like in a way. 
 <br> 
 <br> Leveling: The first 10-12 levels go very fast. The majority of leveling at this point comes from questing. When you first log on, by the time you really get a feel for the game/controls, you'll be level 4-5 easily before you know it! I haven't yet had to &quot;grind&quot; for levels, as there are quests EVERYWHERE, but I did notice that after level 12 or so, the leveling pace starts to slow down. I don't know if the XP is jacked up right now because of beta, or what the high level curve is like, but so far it seems like its got a good balance to it. You start off fairly fast, then slowly, slow down. 
 <br> 
 <br> Quests: TONS of quests, they really give you a sense of immersion and adventure. Quests drive this game. Somehow blizzard has managed to make even the &quot;fetch&quot; quests seem like a worthy undertaking. This game is PERFECT for small groups of friends who like to quest together. It's also very easy to find a pick up group for whichever quest you may be on, as people in the same area as you are usually on the same quests/level. Where I used to stay on other MMORPGS doing the leve &quot;grind&quot; and watching that XP bar move ohhh so slowly, I rarely even look at the XP bar when I am questing in WOW. 
 <br> 
 <br> Items: Lots of items in the game and more to come. This has been a weak area so far, but I am sure they are working on it. You often see the same set of items for sale many times. Last night I finally saw my first (rare?) blue text item, it was a level 24 BP that has some very nice stats. My pally has some nice stuff, I think my Armor is 390 with my buff up, a level 17 paladin I was with last night (he didnt use a shield -80 ar) only had 280. Items can make or break your character IMO. 
 <br> 
 <br> Overall this game is better in beta then alot of other MMORPG out there in retail right now. There are alot of things to finish and work out, but even in the state the game is in now, I can't stop playing. 
 <br> 
 <br> Just my 2 cents!

 <br> 
 <br> <i>I have made it to a level 4 warlock, undead, all I have done so far are a few quests here and there. 
 <br> 
 <br> First thing that struck me with WoW was the music. I really enjoyed the music in FFXI and I really enjoy it here too. Things like this might not be important to you but I feel the little things are very important. Most games like this I end up playing my own music, this game I feel that won't be necessary. I look forward to going to new places to hear more music. 
 <br> 
 <br> The graphics are nicely done. It's that Warcraft style we all know and love. I know I don't have to mention anything because of the movies and screenshots but I do feel that this is a strong point for them even though some may not like the non-realistic approach. 
 <br> 
 <br> Rest state. So far I havent dropped from 200%. I am also not paying attention to my experience earned. Maybe that is just me but I have earned two levels so far unexpectedly because of questing and just having fun looking around. Maybe that will change as I get more familiar with the game. As it begins to effect me I will let you guys know my feelings about it. 
 <br> 
 <br> Day and night. I played a bit before work and an hour after before the world went down. I didn't notice it until I looked for it. Unless I find things I can only do at certain times of the day I don't think this will bother me like I thought it would, both day and night are beautifully done. 
 <br> 
 <br> NPC interaction. What NPC interaction? Most people I click on don't say anything. Hopefully that is just because they are doing Human side first from what I've heard. The quest descriptions have all been well written though. I just wish I could talk to the people more then what is possible now. 
 <br> 
 <br> The interface. It is more or less tried and true. I don't mind it at all. I guess it reminds me of DAoC. I do like having a map in the top right corner. The popups on info are a bit annoying though, I wish it would display everything by default somehow. 
 <br> 
 <br> Combat is crisp too. Finally an MMORPG that I have had the pleasure in playing that shows what ailments are on the creature you are fighting. It is very nice that at a glance I can see my DoT spell and curses have landed without memorizing the look of the spell on the person's avatar. I am also surprised at how well my pet listened too. I have played a few where the pets just would go off and do their own thing, get stuck, etc. I went into the mines, ran out, and had enemies all around me and the imp did not target anything I didn't want him to and he didn't get stuck anywhere either. I was very happy with that. 
 <br> 
 <br> Anyway that is it for me for now. I will add more to this as I find likes and dislikes.
 <br> 
 <br> (ed.  ...Later posted on thread...)
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I am at L7 at this point and still havent fallen below rested. I am starting to think this is why people have a problem with it. They get that taste of it for a long time and then when it goes away it is viewed as a penalty. I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard doesnt change it to where you are starting out at 100% and only time at an inn/city will get you beyond that. 
 <br> 
 <br> The quests are enjoyable though. One I had to sneak my way around a farm and steal ten pumpkins. You had the option of killing the humans or just sneaking. I like quests that can be accomplished in more then one way. I hope I come across more like this. The collection quests so far are not tedious either. For the most part every other or every fourth creature (at the worst) drops the quest item needed. Most times I get an almost 1:1 ratio on kills and drops. The nice thing about some of the quests is that they will have you kill X ammount of something and collect X ammount of an item. Well the things you are killing will be dropping that item so the quest makes more sense. I just love the ones that have you kill 30 spiders and bring back the armchair of lazyboy resting +10. (Well you get the idea.) 
 <br> 
 <br> I feel like there is a purpose to the quests, I hope that feeling doesn't go away. 
 <br> 
 <br> My only have two complaints, the NPC's lack of interaction and the fact that if you choose to display names above avatars it just looks ugly. They need to work on the overhead text a bit I think but it might just be me.

				Hello. 
 <br> 
 <br> I think this game stinks. I am not trying to tick anyone off, or start an argument, but this is my opinion so far. I have 3 chars lvl 20 since phase 3 beat, and I am wondering when the fun starts? I will admit I like a lot of player interaction, and this game has very little compared to games I have played over the years. Everyone in the game looks almost identical!?!?! I mean, the character customization is so limited, it makes the original EQ look detailed by comparison! Anywho, the graphics are cartoony, fuzzy and old-looking. I will not buy this game. As much as I hate to support the Machine that is Sony, there game is looking way better (I know, I have only gone so far as the char creator, but even that blows away WoW) Way more races, and each char can get so much individual detail. My 2 cents.

				<span style="font-weight:bold;">(This was originally posted by me, raarg lol on 20 July at this <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916144238/http://vnboards.ign.com/WoW_General_Board/b19789/72414729/?10">Thread</a>.  Was reposted here for consolidation and ease of viewing.  Thanks!) </span>
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Before I begin, I want to take a moment to clarify a couple of minor things so that most of you will understand the perspective from which I view this game, and for you to know how much salt to take with it.  My first MMORPG was Everquest, which I played for just over 2 years.  I then played DAoC for another two years.  I&#8217;ve also had minor experiences in other various MMORPGs (AO, SWG, Horizons).   However, I am anything but an MMORPG expert.  I&#8217;m not on staff for my knowledge of MMORPGs, but for my willingness to go gather information and volunteer where I can.   Furthermore, I&#8217;m a huge Warcraft fan and have been anticipating this game for a long time (so I am biased).  As of right now, my in game experience resides almost solely on my main character, an Undead Warlock (PvP server) which is level 28.   My /played is over 100 hours.  My play style in MMOs has been largely that of a &#8220;tourist&#8221;; I&#8217;m a very &#8220;casual&#8221; and social gamer.  Lastly, I just want to make it clear that my intention is NOT to recruit you to play WoW, <span style="font-weight:bold;">I&#8217;m just sharing my experiences and the impressions</span> I&#8217;ve been left with for the last 30 days in Beta.  It is NOT a definitive review or prediction of what WoW will be when released. 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">THE BAD</span>
 <br> 
 <br> Might as well &#8220;stick it to the man&#8221; from the beginning and chase off as many folks as I can.  Let&#8217;s begin with <span style="font-weight:bold;">Bit Torrent.</span>  It sucks in conjunction with its usage for patching the game.  It does a terrible job, especially when compared to other games in the genre.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Character Creation</span> is weak, especially for an MMO coming out this late in the &#8220;game.&#8221; The current physical customization is simply not up to par with other games that are out or in production.  Another weakness in character creation is the inability to customize one&#8217;s stats.  Although I understand the concept Blizzard is going for with this, I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with it.  I&#8217;m all for KISS (keep it simple, stupid), but this is too simple.  The lack of a <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tutorial</span> rubbed me the wrong way.  Although I&#8217;m a MMO vet and was able to quickly figure out what was going on around me, there are going to be true newbs, and the current series of watered down tips and hints isn&#8217;t much help.  When it comes to the UI, I feel that it should contain more than just one skill bar.  Currently, if you want more than one skill bar, you have to use Cosmos.  I&#8217;m not keen on going to <span style="font-weight:bold;">third party applications</span>, even if Blizzard allows them.  The future of these is still to be determined.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">graphics</span> to the game use a low polygon count, which leave things looking blocky, which folks don&#8217;t like.  Furthermore, the <span style="font-weight:bold;">water surfaces</span> need some work.  Some places it looks ok, other places it looks out of place.  And it interferes with the third person camera while swimming.  
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Generic Dungeons</span>, those that are basically low level no-name places, are carbon copies of each other (eg the &#8220;spider mine&#8221; in the night elf area and the &#8220;imp mine&#8221; in the troll area).  This isn&#8217;t too frequent, but once is too much in my book.  I&#8217;ve also noticed a small problem with the &#8220;uniqueness&#8221; of certain <span style="font-weight:bold;">creature models</span>.  For example, why does a sap beast on Stonetalon Peak look the same as the ectoplasms in Wailing Caverns?  While we are talking about models, let&#8217;s talk about <span style="font-weight:bold;">item models</span>.  There simply are not enough different equipment models in the game right now.  This is a severe weakness when combined to the weak character creation currently in place.  Although <span style="font-weight:bold;">magical items and drops</span> tend to open up quite a bit more after 20+, Blizzard definitely needs to add more diverse items and never stop.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">NPCs</span> in the villages could be a little more interactive also, and was kinda disappointed with how many of them fail to act or interact.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Quest System</span> is also going to redefine the way people interact with strangers.  I labeled this in the bad, because it is my feeling that this is going to hurt the game initially, as folks who are so used to the standard of go to camp A and grind away until Level X and then go to Camp B, etc,  are going to have a tough time adapting to the pace and flow that WoW is pushing with the quest system.  
 <br> 
 <br> My last real complaint and reservation with the game is how <span style="font-weight:bold;">PvP</span> is going to be implemented and balanced.  In my opinion, this game&#8217;s success is going to hinge heavily on what it can do in this area.  Until I know more, I am going to assume the worst.  Here recently Blizzard has made a couple of <span style="font-weight:bold;">PvP policies</span>.  While admittedly short term fixes, they concerned me greatly because they were too heavily reliant on GM intervention instead of a PvP dynamic that is self correcting.  I also fear that <span style="font-weight:bold;">PvE</span>, while even at this stage is rich, engaging, and abundant, will simply not provide enough &#8220;end game&#8221; things to do for players that are anti-PvP.   However, both PvP and PvE are nowhere near complete, so much is to be seen.
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">THE OUTSTANDING</span> (Beware!  The following contains rampant fanboism and strong emotion!)
 <br> 
 <br> While the polygon count might have been low, the Blizzard <span style="font-weight:bold;">art department and world designers</span> have come together to produce the single most beautiful and unique world I&#8217;ve ever seen in an MMO.  It is utterly mind blowing.  The models are superbly rich in detail and look great!  The world has been put together in such a fashion that I was NEVER left feeling like the devs got bored one day and decided to cut and paste their way to glory.  As a Blizzard fan, the effect that the world and environment had on me was tear jerking (in a good way!).  The most memorable such occasion was when I entered the Throne Room in the Ruins of Lordaeron, the place where a few cinematics occurred in WC3.  What a magical feeling to be standing there at the very spot where Arthas had usurped the throne and set very tragic events into motion!  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">towns, cities, ruins</span>, and simple building <span style="font-weight:bold;">architecture</span> (they did an awesome job recreating the actual buildings from the RTS series) leave no doubt that you are adventuring in the lands of Azeroth.  I can't stress enough the amount of detail that has been put into these!  Its incredible!  Furthermore, they do an excellent job of making the world feel inhabited, while at the same time portraying the dark days of the past (via the ruins) and the troubles to come (the militaristic stance of many places).  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sound FX</span> are beautiful and really add to the gaming experience at all levels and activities.  
 <br> 
 <br> WoW has also managed to marry and unite the concept of MMO (persistent world with 1000s of players) and RPG (role playing game)! At no time have I felt like I was in an MMO and had to go to the nearest level appropriate camp to grind my life away in numb oblivion.  There&#8217;s always something to do or something to get done.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">questing system</span> makes leaps and bounds to really get the player active in the world and story.  It puts the role playing back into the genre, without having to be a role player!  My first quest was to help fight back the Scourge from the Forsaken starting town!  I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  Not in game for more than a couple of minutes, and I&#8217;m already knee deep in the story and struggle that defines Warcraft.  The whole game proceeds in this fashion, with the quests gently carrying you through the landscape and deeper and deeper into the conflict.  The quests, while not the most revolutionary in the genre, are definitely well written and fun.  The quests pit you against your enemy, be it horde or alliance, and not so much against the environment and wildlife.  I&#8217;ve had so many quests take me into human settlements to wreak havoc that it&#8217;s wicked cool!  (I&#8217;ve had to poison dogs, steal pumpkins, sabotage machines, and even plant a WMD, not to mention killing dozens of hateful Alliance dudes!!!)  
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Trade skills</span> are really well done.  Very simple, but very useful.  And the gathering skills really play well and give yet another thing to do while out and exploring.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Maps </span>are in game, and they are great!  The game encourages you to explore and open up parts of your world map by granting you experience in the process.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Elite/Instanced Dungeons</span>(and generic dungeons) are awesome.  I&#8217;ve been in three thus far (Shadowfang keep, Wailing Caverns/Cavern of Mists, and Razorfen Kraul), and each one was built with obvious care and attention to detail to provide a unique experience for each.  The best dungeons I&#8217;ve ever seen, bottomline.  Furthermore, the Instanced Dungeons make great places for those folks that just wanna group up and <span style="font-weight:bold;">grind </span>away without interference.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">/1 General Chat</span>!  It is so nice, even when you&#8217;re not grouped, to be able to quickly call for assistance or just listen to good natured banter that is zone wide.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Combat</span> is fun and exciting.  It&#8217;s not revolutionary by any means, but it is fast and fluid and allows the players options.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Death</span> is really well handled, and definitely caters to the casual audience.  You basically get to choose between making a corpse run or biting the bullet and sucking up an XP loss.  Because the graveyards are numerous and pretty well placed, you are never more than 5 minutes away from your corpse.  
 <br> 
 <br> The current implementation of <span style="font-weight:bold;">PvP</span>, while admittedly very base, is fun and exciting in the aspect that you can actually take the fight to the enemy, and you are not restricted to fighting in a desolate and boring no man&#8217;s land.  Even the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Contested Zones</span> are really well done, with Horde and Alliance outposts and towns dotting the landscape that give the players a feeling that they are actually fighting for something other than some long forgotten and half abandoned castles.  Other miscellaneous <span style="font-weight:bold;">Knick Knacks</span>  such as the Warcraft style corpse <span style="font-weight:bold;">skeletons</span> on the ground when someone gets killed, the <span style="font-weight:bold;">non combat pets</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">voice emotes</span>, and various other fluff just adds to the overall fun level.  
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">IN CLOSING</span>
 <br> 
 <br> This game has brought back that special &#8220;first&#8221; time feeling for me, that I had originally experienced so long ago in Everquest.  It&#8217;s amazingly fun, and the game is not even complete yet.  Like I&#8217;ve told a few RL friends:  I never walk away from a game session in WoW feeling like I didn&#8217;t have fun or didn&#8217;t accomplish anything.  Also, I&#8217;ve never felt like I had to level to experience the fun stuff (despite getting constantly mauled in pvp).  With that said, this game has a long and bumpy road ahead of it still.  Its nowhere near complete, so don't hold your breath!  
 <br> 
 <br> Regardless, outside some major catastrophe, I will most definitely be purchasing this game and playing it for years to come.  
 <br> 
 <br> PS.  I understand I failed to address a number of topics (I had to cut a bunch because of length lol!).  If you have any questions concerning those presented or not, please feel free to pm me or otherwise contact me.  Thanks for your time and attention.

				Comparing mostly to DAOC (Mordred)since that is all I know of MMORGs
 <br> 
 <br> 1. Graphics: Flat character models. Sub par movement animations. Skies are terribly done. No cloud movement no realism. Trees and other nature is very static and flat. It looks worse then DAOC or AC2 (which is 3 y.o. games)
 <br> 2. Interface :Easy to learn, intuitive.But skills Icons are poorly drawn and hard to see what they mean. They just blend in and don&#8217;t stand out enough on quick bar.
 <br> 3. Sounds: Well done. Even ambient and menu sounds.
 <br> 4. Buildings and interiors: Poor detail. Low polygon. On a plus side I can only say some interiors are immersive because of use of lighting and fires.
 <br> 5. Char models: On plus side they look funny and distinct. Not sure I want to play a cartoon character unless I am 13 years of age.Blocky bodys and low detail even at high resolution.
 <br> 5. Water effects: Since it is mostly very well done in modern games I cannot understand why it is such a bad job in WOW. Water looks terrible (Radeon9800Pro on high settings)...
 <br> Conclusion: It is very nice game for 9-16 y.o. Had it been released in mid 80s or early 90s it would ve been revolutionary. Right now it looks like project that got stuck in development for way too long and has nothing to offer at release. It is 21st Century outside and this game is a throw back.

				I am in love with the artistry of the graphics. They want the game to be as playable and accessible to as many people as possible. Not everyone can afford higher end cards, and yes $200 dollar cards are NOT easy to come by for struggling college students, etc...
 <br> 
 <br> The artistry of the game more than makes up for the &quot;polygon count&quot;. Use of color and style far surpasses DAOC anyday, especially their use of texturing. I completely understand that the graphics could be &quot;better&quot; and I'm sure that Blizzard knows they could be, but for the constraints they put for themselves they've done an amazing job.

 <br> After spending some time in the stress test I can say without a doubt I'll probably not be playing WoW. I'm glad that Blizzard allowed us the opportunity to see the game for ourselves now before spending the money on it. 
 <br> 
 <br> My grades.

 <br> UI isn't great, but it isn't all that bad either. I've definately seen better and used much better UI's in games like CoH and Horizons(yes Horizons had an awesome UI - though the game has a lot of other problems UI was not one of them). 
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics and Animation - (C-) 
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics in this game are circa 1999 at best. I was expecting it to really jump out at me after seeing so many wonderful screen shots. Then I saw it first hand and was very disappointed in both the graphics and animation overall. Character customization is sorely lacking as well and reminds me of how poorly implemented L2's was. 
 <br> 
 <br> Stability - (A) 
 <br> 
 <br> Game is as stable as CoH is from what I can see. I didn't see any lag, but that maybe because I have an extremely powerful gaming rig and a fast DSL connection. Blizzard gets an A here. 
 <br> 
 <br> Gameplay - (C+ to a B- ) 
 <br> 
 <br> What can I say. I was expecting some great game play after all the hype on these boards. Then after playing for some time it struck me really hard like a huge hammer to the forehead. &quot;Hey! I've done this before in game X, or I've played better in game Y! This isn't really anything new and in fact it basically brings back some of the old MMORPG luggage many of us gamers have harped on for so many years. Blizzard brings back camping in a big way - now where have we seen this? Get ready to do lots and lots of kill and fed-x quest. Combat is bland and not very fun especailly for melee types in this game, but if you like playing a mage or some kind of class that uses magic then you'll have a bit more fun - at least from what I experienced. 
 <br> 
 <br> I finally got to experience the 24hr clock and yes I still think it is a bad idea. Had to correct the gamma setting on my monitor to see half the time. 
 <br> 
 <br> This game is too solo friendly, just as CoH is and this will in turn drive players that seek to play a more social friendly game away from WoW in my opinion. Lots and lots of people just seemed to busy to talk or assist one another in game. I've seen this before in CoH and well for me that was a big turn off. 
 <br> 
 <br> NOTE: I realize this is just beta, but I suspect from what I saw of this game that it is going to basically play as it does right now. They are to far ahead in the developement of the game to drastically change much now if they are shooting for a 4th quarter of 2004 release. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Not a bad review but a little bias me thinks.

 <br> 
 <br> Well, I might as well post my thoughts on the WOW stress test ... with the servers being down and all.
 <br> 
 <br> ( -&lt;1 to 10&gt;+ scale )
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics:  I like them, but I'm more of a gameplay man than a graphics man.  Kudos the Blizzard art team, for a job well done.  I feel like they achieved what they were looking for, and I do feel like I'm &quot;in&quot; the Warcraft series.
 <br> SCORE ( 8 )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics&gt;(Spell Effects):  OK.  I remember looking forward to   spell effects in new game a few years ago, as each new generation of games came out ... new spells effects raised the bar from game to game.  Over the last couple of years, it almost seems to me that spell effects are just &quot;OK&quot; at best ... bah!!! I like to play mage type characters ... and the spell effects in WoW are OK at best.  Another cardinal sin ... some of the higher lvl spell effects, and cross-class spell effects are the same ... not good for a 2004 game IMHO.  ( TIP TO DEVELOPERS:  Particle effects are a cheap way to entertain the masses, and still look good by today's standards ... case in point AC1 and AO's spell effects are merely particle effects, but they really feel like magic to me  ... with all of the swirling etc... )
 <br> SCORE ( 5 )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Animations: Very good.  While melee combat contact animations are always a little shaky in MMORPG's ... WoW animations for combat are good ( like to see the blood from a Rogue's attacks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916144238im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">   Emote and idle animations are spot on ... good job guys!
 <br> SCORE ( 9 )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Sound:  Very Good.  Blizzard has always done well with sound, WoW is no exception.  Only thing I see needing some work is the footfalls over different terrain ... but the combat sounds and the sounds of running in armor are superb.
 <br> SCORE ( 9 )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> User Interface:  Hmmm. Needs some more work.  The user interface in WoW is not bad, merely functional.  I DO NOT LIKE HAVING TO OPEN TWO WINDOW'S TO EQUIP MY ITEMS!  A right click to equip should have been a no-brainer.  I like to be able to move windows... all other than just chat.  The two mest UI's on the market are from two of the least popular games ... Shadowbane &amp; Horizon's.  Both of theses offered FULL customizations with the UI ... Please take a look at these games BLIZZ.
 <br> SCORE ( 5 )
 <br> 
 <br> Chat:  Hmmm, not too bad ... not too good.  I did not like having to type /1. before posting in general chat ( this may just be my lack of know how here .. but it was not jumping out at me on how to do it a different way.
 <br> SCORE ( 7 )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Gameplay: Nice work guys.  After playing the game for a few days, I can already see the onion layer effect here.  Gameplay is as simple or as complex as you want it to be.  Mob AI is spot on ... ez to figure out how to &quot;pull&quot;  or &quot;solo&quot; as needed.  I like to quest, and while anyone can do a good Fed-Ex type quest ... you guys are Masters with the lore and storytelling.  I look forward to playing the full version of this game, one where I don't have to worry about sinking allot of time into my character and the then having it wiped ... RELEASE THE GAME ALREADY~~~
 <br> SCORE ( 8 )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> PVP:  Have not tried yet ... to be continued.
 <br> SCORE ( ? )
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Well, I do have a few other things to mention:
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Why are there no Fish in the underwater areas?
 <br> 
 <br> Like the footprints in the snow ... nice touch.
 <br> 
 <br> Really like the voices of the Trolls.
 <br> 
 <br> 24 hour clock is retarded.
 <br> 
 <br> I like the rest idea ... really like it at 200% XP <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916144238im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> From a company that made Diablo, Loot needs a good upgrade ... do not like having the same weapon as every other JoeBlow.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> All I can think of right now.  I do plan on buying th game ... and look forward to playing the game as a senior/veteran character.
 <br> 
 <br> OVERALL SCORE: ( 7 )&lt;--- Based strictly off a few days of stress testing
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Krul
 <br> 
 <br> CYA in Game !!!

				Background:
 <br> 
 <br> Played EQ, AC1, DAOC
 <br> Beta'd and chose not to play release: Neocron, AC2, AO, Eve
 <br> 
 <br> Been playing WoW since the undead phase of F&amp;F Alpha.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> UI: B (With Cosmos UI: A)
 <br> 
 <br> It's actually a fairly decent UI. You have 12 hotkeys, and a lot of the interface screens are accessible easily. However, it takes a 3rd party custom UI to really make the interface shine. Your abilities greay out when unusable, and they highlight in a clock-like fashion.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics: A
 <br> 
 <br> They've chosen a comic book style, it works pretty well, and it makes you feel like you're in a Warcraft universe.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Gameplay: D
 <br> 
 <br> There are just too many quests. At first it was cool, because you had something to do. But then so does everyone else. If noone else is doing your current quest, you're on your own. Later on, you start needing groups in order to do the instances. If you aren't in a good guild, good luck! The ideal 5 man group breaks down into Warrior, Priest, Mage, and 2 other damage classes. The great holy trinity of EQ rears its ugly head in a game that really should have learnt from its predecessors.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Miscellaneous gripes:
 <br> 
 <br> The rest system should never have been born. It doesn't hurt the powergamer, but surprisingly enough, it really hurts the casual gamer. Yes the casual gamer levels up fast when they play, but they aren't receiving the same income as they are killing less mobs, for the same xp earned.
 <br> 
 <br> I used to play a lot with my wife. In one of the pushes they changed the way xp was allocated. If you are both at 0% xp in your level, and one is higher level than the other, and you make a kill that is worth 1% of the xp required for the higher level to level up, then the lower level also receives exactly 1% of their xp needed. The lower level will NEVER catch up while you are making the same kills. We tried to agree to only play together, but it just became yet another pointless restriction to the game.
 <br> 
 <br> Travel time is excessive. Some of the later quests make you hop around all over the 2 continents. During a bird ride just today, I unloaded the dishwasher, and put in some more dirty dishes, and when I got back I still hadn't landed. The mage gets to alleviate travel time as they get access to self ports and can summon a portal for anyone else. The warlock does have a summon spell, but it requires 2 extra people to activate it, and yes, this is another stupid restriction.
 <br> 
 <br> There is no autoloot. There isn't even a &quot;loot all&quot; button. Thankfully the cosmos UI team added an autoloot, but Blizzard consequently disabled the ability to loot from UI code. Again the cosmos team came to our rescue with a loot helper, where the loot window was moved such that the next item to loot was right under your cursor. All you needed to loot was to click, click, click without having to move the mouse. Looting without this helper is just a pita. Oh, the loot window only shows up to 3 items, to loot more you have to click on this down arrow widget.
 <br> 
 <br> Bind on Acquire items. Blizzard's answer to no item decay. This is an outdated mechanic to prevent people who aren't in good guilds to be able to have access to the stuff that the top guilds can get.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Overall score: 8
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Summation: This is a great game that will attract many many people, and will be a fantastic hit. I, however, will not be playing.

				Ok, after 4 long years I must say... the wait was damn well worth it! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916144238im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> To be frank, this game is THE BEST MMORPG I have ever played, bar none (and I've pretty much played them all).
 <br> 
 <br> The game is a pure blast, even in the first few seconds. Currently, my main is a level 17 warrior (focusing on 2H swords and Mining/Engineering) on the Khaz server.
 <br> 
 <br> Quests: The first thing I noticed are the quests. They all have an indepth, linking story to them (some larger than others) and are perfect for what they are. Some quests are hunting quests, some are gathering quests, some are looting quests and then there are tons of others that can't really be classified since no other game has done them before (for instance, there's one where you must convince a drunk to give you his special mug by talking to him but then start a bar fight). Almost every turn to look, there's someone giving out quests. Some are harder then others (some require certain tradeskills, groups, stealth, lockpicking, etc.) but most are solo friendly (and I'm about 50/50 group/solo player).
 <br> 
 <br>  I give the quest catagory a 10/10
 <br> 
 <br> Combat: Combat is fun and engaging as a warrior (dunno about the other classes but I'm sure they are too) and you have a myriad of skills at your disposal (some require different battle stances, positions, weapon types, reationaries) but they are very costly as you level up. Combat is fast, intuitive and just plain ole' good fun. There are a few animation bugs (understandable since it's beta) such as position locks and wierd movements but they don't hamper the gameplay at all since it doesn't affect character.
 <br> 
 <br> I give the combat catagory a 9/10
 <br> 
 <br> Skills: At level 10, you have access to talents and the way they are set up is almost exactly like Diablo 2 skill-trees. There are tons of talents and pretty much any talent you can think of for a warrior, they have em. Talents offer a lot of skill choices/bonuses in combat in addition to your regular attack skills. Talents also help each player differ themselves from the other players of the same class. I, for example, am focusing on brute force using 2H swords and critical strikes. Other warriors might focus on using shield protections while wielding a mace OR some warriors might choose the berserker style and use duel weild and faster attacks. This overall makes your character standout and feel more unique, which I always love.
 <br> 
 <br> I give the skill catagory a 9/10
 <br> 
 <br> Customization: At first, I was a little disappointed with the character creation since there aren't that many choices (Blizzard has said, they plan on release many more choices before release though). It's better than DAoC and EQ1 but no where near as good as CoH in terms of choices. Items, skills and talents will make the real difference among each player however. As I said before there are tons of talent/skill choices to choose from which will always make your character standout. I only saw maybe 2 other 2H sword warriors besides me and even then, their talents were different than mine. As well as skills/talents, items also helps make your character stand out amongst the crowd. I've never seen 1 character look in the least bit alike so far and that is heavily due to the items. There are TONS and TONS of items so far whethere they're quest, dropped, treasure (from treasure chests), crafted, etc. Every steampunk/medieval item you could think of is in this game and then some. Special spell scrolls, food, weapons, armor, potions, metals, gems, guns, etc. are in this game! From the looks of it, WoW could turn out to have the most items of any MMORPG so far (even more than EQ1). And besides, who cares about what your face looks like if you're gonna be wearing a Plated Helm or Troll mask covering it? 
 <br> 
 <br> I give the customization catagory a 8/10
 <br> 
 <br> Interface: I love the interface of this game for some reason. It's very easy to use and also accomidating even to MMORPG newbies. The maps are hand drawn and are very detailed and fun to look at (as you explore, you open up more areas of the map). There are also tons of customization options for the interface including customizable keymappings, point and click movement if you desire, customizable chats, etc. Overall, very well done and the best of any MMORPG so far.
 <br> 
 <br> I give the Interface catagory a 10/10
 <br> 
 <br> Tradeskills: Normally in MMORPGs, I never tradeskill because I hate them! But WoW is the first MMORPG where tradeskills are actually FUN! Currently I'm almost a journeyman Engineer and an apprentice Miner. Mining is great because there are tons of ore deposits all over Azeroth and Miners also have a special ore tacking skill where these deposits are mapped out and are on your radar. In order to mine, you first need the skill and a mining pick. You then can go up to an ore deposit (Copper is the easiest to mine, then Tin is the next, and then so on) and you proceed to mine it until the deposit is dry. Once that happens, the deposit disappears and you have to move on to a new one. It's every easy to do and can be easily done while exploring, hunting, questing, etc. anywhere in the world. Engineering also requires mining due to the ore that you need to build special engineering items such as bombs, guns, fireworks, etc. Later on, you can create some really cool and unique items such as mechanical squarrels, goggles, bullets, lock bombs, universal remote, etc. 
 <br> 
 <br> I give the Tradeskills catagory a 9/10
 <br> 
 <br> Stability: Since it is beta, there are still a few bugs around but from 20 hours /played, I've never gone LD, crashed, lagged or pinged at any time. The FPS is at an almost constant 60 (a little less in capital cities). For a stress test, I was blown away at how great the stability was!
 <br> 
 <br> I give the Stability catagory a 10/10
 <br> 
 <br> Environment: Azeroth... need I say more?  Best environment I've ever seen! Each zone is unique and has a very distinctive flavor to it. No loading times at all (except going into instances and traveling to the other continent). The game world is also HUGE! I'd say it's about 3 times the size of DAoC and 1.5 times the size of EQ1 (after the first 2 expansions). And the best part is, when you run around, you actually RUN! 
 <br> 
 <br> I give the Environment catagory a 10/10
 <br> 
 <br> Overall: 9.4/10
 <br> 
 <br> Like I said before, WoW is the best MMORPG to date!

				WoW is, IMHO, a masterpiece of dynamic, interactive art. There may be other games with superior graphics, storyline, whatever, but WoW will long be remembered as the premier game, of the new wave of MMORPGs coming out, for its total package.
 <br> 
 <br> The game has breath-taking artwork, glorious music, humor, adventure, strategy, and so many more features to draw the player in and hook them on the game. In less than an hour of play I knew I had finally found the game of my dreams.
 <br> 
 <br> You don't have to be a fan of MMORPGs to love this game. I have seen a number of MMORPGs and I have only really been impressed with EQ and DAoC. There are other games that have some really stunning features, but as a whole package, they have left me with no desire to purchase the program or pay for a subscription.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW, on the other hand, is worth the cost of the program just to explore the world the artists and software folks at Blizzard have built. It is a true fantasy land you can sink into and enjoy.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW is to the light side of human nature what Doom is to the dark side. I imagine there will be a small population that will not care for the positive nature of WoW but hundreds of thousands of other users will find it to be a breath of fresh air in a market saturated with blood and gore.
 <br> 
 <br> The game is also poised to be the first MMORPG to address the growing market of seniors who will soon overshadow the current group of primary MMORPGs users. Changes in the economy make it less likely for the Doom generation to have time to play MMORPGs. These folks will be replaced by pre-teens and the older generations in the next 3- to 5 years. While current users will still continue to play, the hard-core users will be those with discretionary money to spend and ample time to play.
 <br> 
 <br> Altogether, WoW is a game that deserves all the free press it has garnered from the MMORPG crowd. There is something in this game for everyone who loves beauty, fantasy, adventure, humor, good folks and good fun. I give this game a 10 out of 10.
 <br> 
 <br> In closing, I would like to thank Blizzard for giving me the opportunity to participate in the stress test. I had no idea, when I signed up, how much this game would change my way of looking at MMORPGs.
 <br> 
 <br> In my first 4 days of play I actually had blisters form on my fingers from playing so much. There were so many things I wanted to do and see, before having the plug pulled for several months, that I couldn't stop until my body finally made me.
 <br> 
 <br> This, I think, is the ultimate compliment I can give you. With EQ and DAoC it took me weeks to warm to the games. With Wow it took only minutes. Congratulations on your magnificent game and I look forward to seeing you as soon as I can lay my hands on a copy of the game.

				First, my MMO background:
 <br> MUDS/Shadows of Yserbius/The Realm/UO/EQ/DAOC/SWG/SB/COH/L2
 <br> 
 <br> I've been playing WOW off and on for three months of Beta, with multiple 20+ characters and 1 40+ character.
 <br> 
 <br> WOW is a very good game, but to me its roots are clear. It is essentially EQ in the Warcraft universe. Many things EQ did wrong, WOW does right. However your goals  in the game are identical to EQs, level and acquire items.
 <br> 
 <br> If someone is looking for a level/loot game done right, this is the game for you.
 <br> 
 <br> The atmopshere and graphics are very good and immersive. Lag has not ever been a problem for me.
 <br> 
 <br> The instanced dungeons are very well done, and there is a lot of content. Soloing is viable, but levelling is always better in a group.
 <br> 
 <br> Levelling is a mixture of quests, but most are of the whack a mole variety. The storyline is very good.
 <br> 
 <br> I do not like the present setup of Horde/Alliance and the limited generic classes. The hero system is a good idea, but again despite being a fun game to play it still is reliant on the same levelling and item acquisition mindset of EQ. That is more a personal choice, than comparatively speaking. Some will love it, I don't.
 <br> 
 <br> The developers 3 years and tons of time in EQ is telling, as the game will feel like home to longtime EQ/DAOC players.
 <br> 
 <br> The game however, is not at all revolutionary, and is a simple upgrade of EQ/DAOC. It is not at all a paradigm shift. If you want a new MMO with content, but the same TYPE of game then WOW is it.
 <br> 
 <br> Obviously WOW is set in the Warcraft Universe, which will be great for Warcraft kiddies, but not as appealing for an AD&amp;D pen n paper guy like me.
 <br> 
 <br> To break the game down in my mind
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics: B
 <br> The graphics are not cutting edge, but are good. 
 <br> 
 <br> Gameplay: B+
 <br> The quests are good. The storyline is good. It is easy to get involved. The game does need more branches and it'd be nice if they implemented a decent reason why Horde/Alliane are separate. This game will have few roleplayers so that to me doesn't seem a good reason.
 <br> 
 <br> UI: A
 <br> The UI is done well. Very well.
 <br> 
 <br> Staying Power: B 
 <br> I do not think a majority of people will stay with this game, because the premise is the same as DAOC and EQ. It does have great hype, but so did a lot of other games &lt;Hi, Shadowbane&gt;. It will sell very well and get a good base, because it is a very good game.
 <br> 
 <br> Originality: D
 <br> This game is an EQ clone. There are no chances being taken, as the game is tailor made with ideas lifted from many sources, and implemented flawlessly. It is EQ done right, with a few things changed. If you want a new type of MMO, WOW ain't it
 <br> 
 <br> Overall: B
 <br> WOW is the game many are looking for, but a lot will take a drive and not find what they are looking for. As good as WOW is, and as much as it is EQ done right, there are a lot of people who do not want to do the EQ thing again.
