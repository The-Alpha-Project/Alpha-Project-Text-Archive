I'm open to suggestions, and I bet a lot of devs are. Present one. It's fine to say &quot;there should be&quot; but we all know there &quot;should be&quot;. However, we've seen what the results of many implimentations have been. So &quot;should be&quot; doesn't really make a difference without bringing a dynamic or ruleset to the table with it. &quot;Should be&quot; leaves us with solutions like &quot;stat loss&quot; or &quot;perma red&quot; that have failed in the past. It brings us various poorly thought out forms of flagging which has ended up as nothing but very handy tools for griefers to manipulate in order to forceflag someone else or trick them into a situation they did not want to be in. 
 <br> 
 <br> We ARE reading what you are saying. Present a system, because &quot;should be&quot; is nothing.  <hr noshade size="2"></hr></blockquote> Obviously you're not reading at all...  Sorry, but it's the sad truth.
 <br> 
 <br> Here it is, again, for the nth time, spelled out in layman's math in one way it could work but it could really work a ton of ways...  Though it's not my job to come up with a method, but merely propose a solution in a format as I have done that could work and that obviously involves very simplistic algorithm processing that is darmatically less than the current area load processing, aggro range processing, and even attack processing that is already in place.
 <br> 
 <br> Honor works as honor works, but killing NPCs of your level or higher gains honor.
 <br> 
 <br> You lose honor for killing x number of players at a determined to be low level (level-10, level-20, whatever), wherein you actively attack them first and where killing more than x will continue a loss of honor.  This could also be tailored to location (if a 60 is hunting in a level normal level 20 hunting ground, for instance).  x equates to a number that is found to be a good representation where a person who kills however many of the determined low level range can be considered griefing.  x can be modified to an algebraic equation that composes a possible ratio of kills by level, for example if you obtain a 0.75 or higher ratio of level to level kills, meaning you kill more of your level or higher rather than lesser of your level, especially much less than your level, you will not lose honor.  There's a few ways where x could be measured in this manner, that's just two examples.  Being attacked automatically wipes all chances to lose honor and can only result in the gain of honor.  A member of a group attacking a much higher level person will enable the player to kill the whole group without any loss of honor.
 <br> 
 <br>  - What does this prevent?  Nothing.
 <br>  - What does it do?  It creates a goal or direction for players to follow that leads away from needless griefing.
 <br>  - Is it a solution to just remove all forms of griefing?  Nope, just a direction.  In fact, players can and would, if implemented, create characters that they use solely for griefing if they enjoying such things, while still having multiple characters to play that can enjoy benefiting from a gain of honor without the need to grief.
 <br> 
 <br> This could lead to a color system, if wanted, displaying a change in colors as people approach a lower ratio score or general score and otherwise with a higher ratio score.  This would work well with the idea of player titles based on honor level (Sir, Lord, Master, Magister, Lady, etc.).

Become hated by you faction for killing the enemy? That's foolish. By that standard Uther Lightbringer would of been branded by a hated man and common swine by the Silver Hand. Dishonor system should be used to make FFA inner-faction combat possible. Just make the penalty so harsh (eg; 1 murder = 3-4 days of KOS to your own faction) that almost no one ever dares do it. Would add a great dynamic though, and would make &quot;criminals&quot; (those with Dishonor) actual criminals, because they murdered their own people, opposed to the enemy they hate. It would take a lot more work, as 3-4 days isn't a big deal to a Lv60 that's bored. But with proper harshness and testing it would be a real neat system and allow a criminal element in the game.
 <br> 
 <br> In general I like Blizzard's stance to, of promoting more heroic PvP rather than penalizing people who kill peons. A dead peasant is still a dead peasant, that'll make any orc happy. 
 <br> 
 <br> I rather see other systems in place to help lessen &quot;lowbie killing&quot;. Reward heroic PvP is a start. Something else that could work is tagging people who kill lowbies with a marker of some sort. And when someone kills that 'marked' person, they get a bit of extra Honor. This would promote &quot;defending your people&quot;.  
 <br> 
 <br> Just stuff like that. Features that promote more serious faction war but still allow realistic killing of lowbies.

 <br> No one is suggesting a system where you become hated by your faction merely for killing the enemy. 
 <br> 
 <br> The most I've seen proposed is a system where you become hated by your faction if you are consistently a coward, always picking easy fights, but never there when the going gets tough.

 <br> <i>Obviously you're not reading at all... Sorry, but it's the sad truth.</i>
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I am reading, but that is the same thing that regularly gets presented. An offer of a PvE 'fix' to a PvP penalty. On top of that, it doesn't take into consideration the existing PvP mechanics (inability to see level of higher level players, highlevel and low level travelling together ungrouped/grouped, etc).
 <br> 
 <br> Your formula does not take into consideration the fact that people will learn it and use it to their advantage. It creates extremely unrealistic limitations to PvP because now I have to take into consideration what zone I am  in and what the *possible* levels are of the people in the zone. Now I have to tailor the levels and numbers of people inmy group to fit that mould. 
 <br> 
 <br> It seems simple to you because you haven't yet tried putting it into motion. Walk through a few normal PvP scenarios in your mind and you can see how the math you presented is a hindrance to PVP gamplay as a whole.

 <br> Those two systems are the same thing. The latter is just more specific. What is summed up by the broad description is still what I'd never support. Dishonor for killing weak opponents can still be broken down to &quot;your faction hates it when you kill the enemy&quot;. Weak or strong, a dead human is still a dead human, the Horde frowning upon killing a weak human is fine for a gameplay dynamic in any other game but not in a Warcraft game, staying true to the lore and realism of Warcraft and the race war is more important to me. It would tame the racial war and make a mockery of much of the Warcraft history.
 <br> 
 <br> Bottom line for me is that any system that penalizes a soldier for killing their hated blood-enemy, regardless of semantics or specifics, is one I won't support.

Note that x is not defined nor is anything else really.  I only propose an option and the boundaries are to be set by the developers.  Who's to say that the level range is not 20 levels less or higher?  How many levels of level difference is needed to ensure that 99% of the time this is not a true issue unless a person specifically engages in activities to grief?  Do you and players you know commonly go to zones you would otherwise never approach for the purpose of just killing players whoe are mostly levels greatly far beneath yours?
 <br> 
 <br> Your 'hindrance to PvP gameplay as a whole' is purely subjective to what you look for in PvP.
 <br> 
 <br>  <blockquote><a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050101183033/http://vnboards.ign.com/user.asp?usr=KyanMehwulfe"><span style="font-weight:bold;">KyanMehwulfe</span></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;">posted on 12/2/04 8:23am</span><hr noshade size="2"></hr>Bottom line for me is that any system that penalizes a soldier for killing their hated blood-enemy, regardless of semantics or specifics, is one I won't support. 
 <br>  <hr noshade size="2"></hr></blockquote> I understand this reasoning, but, as often happens in MMORPGs, you have to take account into more than just the 'reality' of the situation when it comes to affecting the gameplay of other players.  Sure, you should be able to kill all of the enemies you see, but really you really, at level 60, be asked to go into enemy lands or territories where you are asked to kill people way beneath your level for your people or would your time be best spent (and more rewarded for) doing things against those of like level?  Do we forsake one element of the game for the ability to do as a player wants?  Do players really do the right thing to encourage a community that will thrive or do they act selfishly and do not think of the things they do that may diminish their community in the near or far future?
 <br> 
 <br> These same things are asked in regards to the economics of a game and balance.  This is why classes have abilities removed, though one class being able to level faster than others really does absolutely nothing to harm others since they will all eventually reach the end game and enjoy it for what it is, let alone others who are concerned with this aspect of the game have just as much freedom to play the faster leveling class.  Does a race's advantage with one attribute that benefits a certain class need to be changed when everyone has the same option to take advantage of this benefit?  Does this benefit really affect gameplay in the end when there are more ways to skin a cat and when each race has it's own benefit with a certain class?
 <br> 
 <br> They all have about the same amount of purpose in this questions asked, though they oftentimes don't make too much sense overall to some people, and it all comes down to providing a 'balanced' or 'equalized' method of gameplay as best as possible.

 <br> 
 <br> I played DAOC/Dred loved it there, every time I was killed as a grey it just added fuel to the fire. Personally I hope they add a Full FFA server. I came to the dred server much much later than it opend, so getting to 50 was somethign you earned. 
 <br> 
 <br> Full blown PVP is not for everyone, persoanlly I love it. Some people like the consentuial (sp) PVP, great for them. I really like how WOW has implimented this. For me I dont need any reward system to go out and kill people. And if there is a grey in the area I'm in you can bet your ass im going to kill them. Maybe they cant do anything to me, but they can relay information to people who can. So killing greys is not anythign personal, sometimes you just have to do it so the big boys will come play.
 <br> 
 <br> Why do you kill greys, beacuse they are there.

 <br> 
 <br> Then you do not understand powergamers or the playerbase.
 <br> 
 <br> <i>Who's to say that the level range is not 20 levels less or higher? How many levels of level difference is needed to ensure that 99% of the time this is not a true issue unless a person specifically engages in activities to grief?</i>
 <br> 
 <br> You are looking at how the rules will affect problem players but not looking at how these limitations will pan out in regular PvP. I am not saying your ideas won't stop griefing. I am saying that they WILL inadvertently have a negative impact on PvP in general. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br>  <i>Do you and players you know commonly go to zones you would otherwise never approach for the purpose of just killing players whoe are mostly levels greatly far beneath yours? </i>
 <br> 
 <br> You're still trying to solve a problem without looking at the impact the problem will have on normal gameplay.
 <br> 
 <br> <i>Your 'hindrance to PvP gameplay as a whole' is purely subjective to what you look for in PvP. </i>
 <br> 
 <br> Create a ruleset. Walk through it in your mind. Any level limitation you create to resolve the problem of newbkillers will affect the rest of the playerbase. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> There is no one formula to solve the problem.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> If and when it happens, the solution is not a cnp formula where you plug in variables.
 <br> 
 <br> Why are they killing newbs?
 <br> - is there reward in it?
 <br> - do regular actions lack reward?
 <br> - are the newb areas lacking proper protection or too accessible?
 <br> 
 <br> Why aren't the newbs being defended?
 <br> - is it too hard to cover the area?
 <br> - is the newb area 'outdated' as far as the playerbase as matured?
 <br> - is the newb area easy farming? 
 <br> - is it a source of needed/wanted resources?
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> That's just a few of the scores od possible questions to ask to solve a problem. Presenting a mathamatical resolution to a yet undetermined <span style="font-weight:bold;">reason</span> for problem that has not really presented itself is not possible at all. It is arbitrary at best.

I want PVP! But you have to have reasons for pvp and you have to have negatives for certain types of pvp. Without some kind of negative side effect to killing a lowbie, it will run rampant(see current pvp servers for examples). 
 <br> 
 <br> I bring up UO again only because that was the only game that actually got it right the first time then managed to screw it up. Their honor system really sent you onto a path. Either you were an outcast or an noble person.
 <br> 
 <br> In this game with the honor system they need to have negatives associated with killiing people levels below you. Without it you will get what you are getting now. Level 30s camping the level 20 areas and denying them access to questing spots. 
 <br> 
 <br> That is fine if somebody decides they want to go dishonorable and takes the consequences. But right now they lose nothing by being griefers to people 10 level lower than they are. I think if they implemented a system where if you were dishonorable you would lose something. It would erase 75% of the current griefing because the avg joe wont want to bother with it.
 <br> 
 <br> I have to tell you at this point without the battlegrounds done and the honor system not implemented. It may make sense to simply /cancel until they figure it out. I dont want to be greifed in a lowbie area by lvl 50s when I am 20. And I dont want to play on a pve server to find out the battlegrounds suck.
 <br> 
 <br> Seriously for as bad as daoc was or is. At least their pvp made sense. No reward and no consequences from pvp in WoW.

 <br> Under my system, the guy who spends all day killing equal level foes gains honor, the guy who kills low levels and high levels breaks even or makes a little, and the cowardly rat that only preys on weaklings and runs away at the first sign of a challenge loses honor. 
 <br> 
 <br> As he should. You think a proud wariror race like the orcs would respect a coward? Ha! Or the taurens or dwarves or humans or elves having no concept of honor? Please. You're trying to argue against this from a 'roleplay' point of view and are doomed to failure. 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Weak or strong, a dead human is still a dead human, the Horde frowning upon killing a weak human is fine for a gameplay dynamic in any other game but not in a Warcraft game, staying true to the lore and realism of Warcraft and the race war is more important to me.

Jaina's a minority and her actions on Kalimdor do not represent the kingdoms if Ironforge or Stormwind. They still hate orcs with a passion. The last time most Alliance folk saw orcs was the 2nd War.
 <br> 
 <br> As for the semantics, I didn't read what system you've proposed, I'm talking about how the system worked in beta. No honor gain for killing weaklings is fine. My problem is with losing Honor and the Dishonorable. Someone that slaughters peasants won't be heralded a hero but he's hardly going to be hated or shunned by his brothers either. Lot of the Horde would actually praise those actions in fact, especially the Shattered Hand. Same with the Alliance, most humans only remember orcs as the savaged that burned and raped their city into ashes and forced them to exile across the sea. What happened on Lordearon and Kalimdor is just some distant tale they've heard and hardly matters in light of the pain they've endured.

I am not saying your ideas won't stop griefing. I am saying that they WILL inadvertently have a negative impact on PvP in general. <hr noshade size="2"></hr></blockquote>Actually, I am.  And, you haven't proven that how they play out is worse than how they would play out without the dishonor system.  And, they have an inadvertently impact on 'your type' of PvP.  PvP means Player vs. Player.  Did the Battlegrounds of DAoC ruin PvP by limiting levels?  No.  They knew that people wanted to involve themselves in RvR without having to go out and get killed instantly in the frontiers.  Otherwise, they would have never have created the Battlegrounds so people could get involved in Rvr early on.  That is PvP.
 <br> 
 <br> PvP isn't about being whatever level and attacking whatever other level there is.  That's just mindless PK.
 <br> 
 <br> PvP is fighting against your foes towards a goal.  If you set your goal to being to just kill everyone you want, that's PvP.  If there are guidelines that attempt to direct you to kill players of a certain level or higher, that's also PvP.
 <br> 
 <br> PvP is a genre of gameplay, it is not a designated set of rules.  There are many people who RP differently.  Some say that using thees and thous is RP.  Some say that never using /ooc chat is RP.  Some say that playing a dumb ogre is RP.  Some say that taling to NPCs and players, disabling names, and playing the game based only on what you learn and see is RP.  There's no defined way to roleplay.  There's no defined way to PvP.
 <br> 
 <br> So, you can't tell me that what I suggest is against the idea of PvP since it is <i><span style="font-weight:bold;">also</span></i> PvP, just not the exact same as what others want.  It doesn't affect PvP, it still encourages PvP.  It just encourages people to PvP against people within -X Levels and higher.  It doesn't prevent you from killing anyone outside of the regular scope of PvP even.
 <br> 
 <br> So, you can tell me all you want that what I suggest breaks PvP, but the truth is, you're talking about what you want in PvP, not what PvP <i><span style="font-weight:bold;">is</span></i> in definition.

The extreme range of the issue is to prevent level 40s from killing level 10s.  That's it.  Otherwise, the gameplay is the exact same.  A level 10 that initiates combat or leaves a certain area where they normally would be found and gain levels in won't cause dishonor to the person that kills them.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm not saying that anytime a level 60 kills a level 30 that they should lose honor.  I'm saying that a level 60 should be penalized, however slightly, for specifically going to lengths to grief very low level people by going to their hunting grounds, which they do not need to hunt in, and killing the persons there for no reason other than to obtain some quick kills and force them to waste more time leveling.

While saying 'Most people aren't like that,' it has been proven many times in other games that this just isn't so.  It seems to be more than enough.  Just to enforce their greater in-game power over others due to level is enough satisfaction.  That feeling of power they hold over others.

I'm not suggesting that areas should be closed off.  Nor am I suggesting that people should not be able to come into those areas, kill lower levels, and take enjoyment from it.  I just feel that it is proper to have some sort of penalty for such acts over a certain amount or ratio in comparison to the 'normal' acts against those of or greater than their level.

Policing gets very tiresome when you gain nothing from it and the people who are doing the griefing end up gaining more from it.  Players should not be forced into roles as policing lower levels rather than working further towards higher goals just because a very few number of people decide to take offense against those greatly lower in level than them.

They defend the areas they need to, which more often than not are far from the areas where people tend to grief others.  It is not the job, and especially on low server population times, not possible for the players to find those to protect them from others.  It takes only one level 60 player to grief hundreds of lower level players.

Specifically, what newb area isn't for those with the capability, knowledge, and determination to do as such for whatever purpose.  Lower level areas near cities have guards of level 50+ and NPCs normally slightly above or higher than the level range of the area.  But, players do not crowd the city areas or perform their quests in those areas.  A level 60 can easily content themselves with hiding in an often visited dungeon, moving freely throughout it to dispense of others who have no protection.

Resources are available on both sides and in similar quantity.  Human lands don't have a tremendous amount of mineral or other item opposed to orc lands.  Especially not at the lower levels.  The need for resources at later levels is fine, but can be found in areas where it is more appropriate to see those of high level.

 <br> 
 <br> WC3 moved us beyond the &quot;The only good orc is a dead orc&quot; or &quot;the only good human is a dead human&quot; mentality of WC2. 
 <br> 
 <br> To the orcs in Kalimdor, there are humans you should kill (folks like proudmoore out to get you) and humans you should not kill (Jaina and her crew in theramore, etc). 
 <br> 
 <br> An orc who ran around killing defenceless nonaggressive thereamore humans would most certainly be extremely frowned upon by Thrall etc. I'm sure such condcut would be considered dishonorable in the extreme. You can no longer say that the idea an orc would be looked down on for killing humans is silly or doesn't fit with WC lore. It all depends on the type of human. 
 <br> 
 <br> And what about the nightelves? I think all the ones in the N are the ones led by the heroes from WC3, who essentially called a truce, for a time, with the orcs. 
 <br> 
 <br> WoW is a step away from, rather than towards, interracial peace and harmony compared to WC3.

 <br> 
 <br> WRONG loki. Seriously, I don't know if you feel the more you write the more correct you are. At any rate, just PVP on a PVE server and you will be happy. DO not whine about what another person wants to see out of PVP. I am a casual gamer and played Asheron's Call Darktide for a long time. Because I am a casual gamer meant I was low level, for that server, which meant I was ganked, camped, you name it, it happened to me quite often. I not once cried or wanted rules in place to save me. I understood how PVP worked and accepted it. If I wanted safety I woudl have went to a non PVP server. DOn't try to speak for 'you and others' when you have no idea where I have gamed, what I have done, or what it is I want. THank you.

 <br> 
 <br> Right now blizzard has no FFA pvp servers, just 'realm vs realm' pvp servers, which were like all the normal servers in daoc. (Daoc also had pve server). 
 <br> 
 <br> Maybe it's time to campaign for blizzard to put in FFA pvp servers, gank anyone, anywhere, anytime. I think it's going to be pointless to try to convert existing AvH pvp servers into this though, considering that is not what most people who joined these servers had in mind.

 <br> 
 <br> - I'm not asking for safety, but direction.
 <br> - I'm not crying about being ganked, I'm saying that those who gank frequently should not be rewarded.
 <br> 
 <br> None of you are listening.  So, I'll just end the conversation.  It has nothing to do about being ganked and the causes of it.  It has to do with rewarding those for excercises that normally push many good PvPers away from a genre of the game that leads to very low population numbers on the PvP servers.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm not going to go to a PvE server.  I'm playing PvP.  But, I won't be happy, again, but I've put up with it through 5 other games.

 <br> 
 <br> Not exactly.  Blizzards PvP servers are NOT just like normal DAoC servers.  You cannot level up to 60 in peace if you choose, then go PvP.  You are forced into pvp to level up past 25.  BIG difference.  
 <br> 
 <br> The biggest problem people have, which is supported by the E-peen griefer kiddies posting here, is that Blizz said one thing quite loudly (dishonor system), and has now gone back on it.  They could easily implement something that prevents lowbies exploiting any kind of dishonor system.  Something as simple as: If you are 10+ levels below the person you are attacking, you simply cannot HIT them or land spells on them.

Yes, it may exist right now.  Yes, it may exist for the first year even.  But if you play other MMORPG's you realize there comes a point when you go to the newbie towns and NOBODY is there anymore.  Levels normalize, and the large difference in level that exists right now will soon wittle away into a much smaller difference.  That is why &quot;just wait&quot; is actually a smart answer from Blizzard, and also the right one.  The problem will self-correct as it has in other games of this nature.  The first six months of a game like this has a very different level population makeup than a game that is a year+ old.

 <br> 
 <br> Allow a new skill...Ashes to Ashes...you cast it on a opposing dead player...Stops a Dead Person from returning to his body...after his release time(plus an added penalty time) he returns to his bind spot plus the 25% durability hit.  Has a Very Slow Recast of once per day...and can not be used on someone 20 levels below you.  The dead player can still be rezed...but may not run to his body.
 <br> 
 <br> This would allow higher level players the ability to actually police low level areas and get rid of griefers...and the griefer would be penalized by lost time for griefing.

Blizzards PvP servers are NOT just like normal DAoC servers. You cannot level up to 60 in peace if you choose, then go PvP. You are forced into pvp to level up past 25. BIG difference.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Well true. It's a lot alike though, in that it's one side vs the other side, with safe zones and then a contested frontier. 
 <br> 
 <br> I did a lot of pvping welllll before I hit 50 in daoc, and levelled a lot in the frontier so for me, it's probably gonna be pretty similar <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050101183033im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;The biggest problem people have, which is supported by the E-peen griefer kiddies posting here, is that Blizz said one thing quite loudly (dishonor system), and has now gone back on it.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Aye that's the big issue imo. A lot of people are going to have chosen a pvp server with the understanding a certain ruleset would be used, and then, surprise, Blizzard springs a new rule set on them.
