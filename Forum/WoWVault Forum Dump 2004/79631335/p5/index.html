Well its more a thought really.  Half of the servers (correct me if I'm wrong) are PVE and half are PVP with one RP server for each time zone.
 <br> 
 <br> Doesn't this strike you as odd?  
 <br> 
 <br> Three months from now, how many PVP servers are going to be left?  DAoC couldn't keep even 2 PVP servers (yes ffa... I know not the same) and eventually consolidated due to poor population to one server.
 <br> 
 <br> So which leads us to WoW, Realm vs. Realm, I don't think that Blizzard will be able to keep their so called PVP servers going once everyone figures out they don't like the rules.  So you will have three player types:
 <br> 
 <br> 1) PVE
 <br> 2) PVP =&gt; RvR
 <br> 3) PVP =&gt; FFA
 <br> 
 <br> 1) PVE - Player verses Environment.
 <br> 2) PVP - Softcore which is really Realm vs. Realm
 <br> 3) PVP - Hardcore everyone verses everyone.
 <br> 
 <br> Problem is that most people (who have never PVP'd before or played a MMORPG) have signed up on PVP servers and I don't think really understand what that means.  They will find out in 3 months and its an easy prediction that the player type #2's days are limited and will become forced to either become hardcore or go to a pve server.  So don't worry its, Eat the Meek, mentality at its best.  It will all be over soon.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041229041440im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">

 <br> 
 <br> What the response says, however, is that you only get *some* minus to your honour for *attacking* people much lower in level than you. Notice, *attacking* them. Defending is another matter. And killing people of your own level will in turn award you with about the same amount of plus to your honor.
 <br> 
 <br> As I said before, this system is clearly in place to prevent some idiots making a career out of killing lowbies only. I firmly believe you can initiate an attack against 10 lowbies with no trouble at all. It's when you kill 10 lowbies 10 times in a row, when it becomes a problem... just as it should.
 <br> 
 <br> Simply stating that killing enemy NPC's that have a quest-specific purpose for them gives a big minus to honor is in my opinion a clear mark of the right sort of attitude. Afterall, if anything amounted to griefing then that did.. preventing people from even getting quests? Come on.
 <br> 
 <br> People are overreacting. It's obvious there's no point in making a PvP game where you can only fight others of your own level. Why would you ever want to level in that case, as you would never get any power relative to others? And I don't think Blizzard has made that mistake. They just want to make sure it's actual PvP, not &quot;lvl 60 vs lvl 20 gankfest&quot;. For that, I think this is the best solution one could think of.
 <br> 
 <br> As I said, I will kill plenty of people who are so much weaker than I am that they have no chance. Yet I expect to be killed by many people such as me as well. I will no be an asshat and grief by stalking the same person over and over again and doing some stupid dancing animations or somesuch over them with the only purpose of pissing them off. I will simply be efficient and kill as I should in a war against the horde. And every now and then, I'll even let the other people go, knowing their lives were in my hands. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041229041440im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">

 <br> ========================================
 <br> 
 <br> Ever thought it is the griefers, gankers, and zergers that are ruining good pvp games? 
 <br> Just like in Daoc early on, all some people wanted to do was hang out and gank people 30 levels lower than they were that had zero chance of defending themselves. 
 <br> You people call some carebears for not liking to get ganked, I look at the guy who is too chicken to get killed by a player his level so he ganks lowbies instead to make himself feel like a 6 foot hard as a rock e-peen. 
 <br> Funny how this person is seen as some &quot;hardcore&quot; pvper, but the ones who want straight up fights are seen as &quot;carebears&quot;. LOL.

 <br> 
 <br> It seems the server choice is down to Gaheris Type, or Modred type. ( daoc style )
 <br> 
 <br> Why on earth didn't they try to implement something similar to daoc ? ie you can xp safely inside your 'realm' to 60, or make a choice to xp in contested areas, for extra xp, but with the risk of being ganked.
 <br> 
 <br> Comes down to choice really, people dont like 'having' to do something .. given a choice generally makes people feel better.
 <br> 
 <br> Get squished by a level 60 with your lowbie group xping in the frontier, and your more likely to say bah, than throw your toys out of the pram, because it was your choice.
 <br> 
 <br> The way it is now though, you dont have a choice, and that tends to make people angry/upset.
 <br> 
 <br> add some more 'home zones' and put more of the quests in these zones, allow people to xp safely if they want.

 <br> As it stands, blizz are giving people a good reason to return to games like daoc. Which i have to say, has one of the best pve/pvp systems going. ( barring toa/ml/nf/balance etc etc ;p )

 <br> 
 <br> 1. When exactly did Blizzard birth their concept of the honour system 
 <br> 
 <br> 2. How far along in the testing process were they before discovering 'ono, the knife cuts both ways! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041229041440im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/11.gif" border="0" alt="shock" hspace="0" vspace="0">  ' and 
 <br> 
 <br> 3. Why they publicized...nay, BRAGGED about...a system they obviously either hadn't tested or had no intention of putting in. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> By the way, to those calling those who like the idea of an honour system 'wussies', you can call Blizzard the 'wussies' for reneging. 
 <br> 
 <br> 1. If a high level is exploring enemy territory and gets ganked by low-level defenders, it's his own fault; you play, you pay. Bring a group and pay the price for invading the noobs. It's going to be necessary, since holding a town is going to involve youngin's dying; it's war, not ToonTown. If you can't handle the hit to your rep, then stick to Contested Territories. It's not as if Rep means anything but &quot;Yar, I'm willing to slay whomever gets in my way regardless of this honour crap&quot;. The Honour system would in no way stop you from doing ANYTHING. 
 <br> 
 <br> 2. If lowbies made it to your own territory and are taunting you, then you did a lousy job of patrolling and keeping them out in the first place, now didn't you? Round up those lower levels who'd be happy to play and sic 'em! 
 <br> 
 <br> Wusses, indeed. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041229041440im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Honestly, just made any reward given for kills scale to level comparison, just like PvE. How hard is that?  The fact that level 50's might have be a bit afraid of younger folk doesn't displease me; level should never be an automatic win.

 <br> 
 <br> UO/AC.. not really  putting out the new servers there huh?
 <br> Daoc: merged servers( too few players) and the pvp server is one of the 5 lowest pop servers in the game.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ: 1 word for that server: &quot;crickets&quot;. dead
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Now I'm a busness owner. Why in heavens name would I subject myself to loss in revinue to provide a niche product that has a short shelf life? ( and in my exp. costs more to support. Customer service will spend alot more time in pvp servers than they will in other servers)

 <br> 
 <br> Yes, Blizzard has done a good job in this actually. Although WoW does exhibit a similar system as DAoC and CoH did, it doesn't nearly give the same artificial penalties to hit / damage against enemies of considerably higher level than those two did. Meaning, in WoW a single level 30 character is very likely screwed when put against 5+ level 20 characters. Also, if 50 level 30'ers come to raid a town, that single level 60 character better stay far away since despite being able to kill quite a few of those, they will simply wear him out and slaughter him with their mass alone.
 <br> 
 <br> I like this feature about WoW. The honour system and the more loose attitude to relative level strength seems to make the game a whole lot more sensible. It encourages fun gameplay for everyone and prevents a few high levelers from destroying the fun of tens of low-levelers, while still retaining the proper balance of power.
 <br> 
 <br> And yes, I also agree about the honour part. The people who whine about the carebears being protected are acting like carebears themselves. They're simply asking to be able to log on and off in the low-level areas infinitely doing nothing but slaughtering folks 40 levels below them and not ever being punished for it. Like someone who really wanted to gank newbies only would even have to care about &quot;honour&quot;. Once you make it to level 60, there's no need to go back to your hometown again anyway. You can get repairs elsewhere afterall. I'm no a griefer, I'll PvP against everything including people a lot lower than I am as well as people stronger than I am. And if the honour system becomes a problem, then I'll simply ignore it and proceed with the killing. Afterall, being an outcast would only add to the immersion! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041229041440im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0">

Nothing could be further from the truth. The end game on the PvE servers will be MOSTLY PvP, with a little bit of PvE raiding thrown in for GPs. I'm rather looking forward to it, myself.  <hr noshade size="2"></hr></blockquote> No, noone is forgetting.  The thing is, it is the exact same PvP rules as on the PvP server when you get to the point of being able to kill someone.  You can still kill someone however many levels lower than you if they are engaged in PvP elements.  It's also far from the same.  I'd prefer an open PvP system, but with the option to lose honor as well as gain it.  A win-win situation doesn't work out for more than 90% of the population most of the time, which is why you see most PvP servers dwindle down to 1/5 of the population of other servers over a few months.

Meaning, if they make it a task to just destroy low level persons, then they should lose honor since they really aren't working to take out the more important (higher level) foes of their realm.

 <br> 
 <br> Exactly. With the continued whines completely ignoring comments like this though, I'm getting the picture these guys know exactly why the system is there and oppose it exactly because killing lobies only is what they want to do. They just won't spell it out straight for knowing they'd be utterly ignored and laughed at after that.

 <br>  <hr noshade size="2"></hr></blockquote> Because that's still a reward, rather than a detriment for doing an act that is most often performed to grief the other players.  Rewarding them for the actions at all isn't a detriment for the act.  People in DAoC didn't grief others for the RPs, they did it because they wanted the other player to feel in a position of weakness in comparison to them.  That whole e-peen thing.  No one is at all worried about the people who seek a challenge and therefore seek out opponents of their own skill and slay all those who get in their way (meaning anyone who attacks them or attempts to prevent them from a goal), that's what most people would like to see in PvP, IMHO.
 <br> 
 <br> In order to direct players away from such actions, you have to present some sort of penalty.  Even this loss of honor on a certain level won't remove griefing, but it will be a slight detriment that may make a lot of people think twice about performing such actions in the manner that it has been experienced in other games.

 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> loki, rules shift PvP in favor of the griefers and exploiters. 
 <br> Open PvP gives the griefer much fewer loopholes to abuse. 
 <br> From the statements above it looks like the PvPers are aware of this. They don't ask for less rules so that they can abuse the system. They ask for less rules so they can PvP without having to deal with someone abusing the system. I don't think the PvPers in this thread are blowing smoke or compensating for some deep-rooted desire to gank level 1 characters. They want PvP without bizarre restrictions put in place that do nothing but hinder gameplay and  provide neat 'tricks' for problem players.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> As for low level ganking, here's an example from yesterday:
 <br> 
 <br> A level 21 NE Rogue made it in to Valley of Trials. 
 <br> A low level orc (Gaemina?) preoccupied her with dancing while reporting his position. I scooted my level 18 huntress self in there and killed the NE. 
 <br> 
 <br> Removing her chance to get there or my chance to run down there and take her out removed both funand challenge. 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Well, what about the innocent newbs that...&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> ...should have played on the PvE server if they didn't want to be attacked. I can't see gameplay in WOW going the direction that AC/Darktide is because the world design and the game dynamics are very different.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <i>We're not asking to stop ganking, we're asking to give penalties for obvious ganking above a certain norm.</i> -loki
 <br> 
 <br> What do you suggest? I'm open to suggestions, and I bet a lot of devs are. Present one. It's fine to say &quot;there should be&quot; but we all know there &quot;should be&quot;. However, we've seen what the results of many implimentations have been. So &quot;should be&quot; doesn't really make a difference without bringing a dynamic or ruleset to the table with it. &quot;Should be&quot; leaves us with solutions like &quot;stat loss&quot; or &quot;perma red&quot; that have failed in the past. It brings us various poorly thought out forms of flagging which has ended up as nothing but very handy tools for griefers to manipulate in order to forceflag someone else or trick them into a situation they did not want to be in. 
 <br> 
 <br> We ARE reading what you are saying. Present a system, because &quot;should be&quot; is nothing.

It is about killing the enemy.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> No, you're thinking of greifing. If you want a 'sissy greifers' server, ask Mythic to make one for you. 
 <br> 
 <br> PvP is about challenging fights. I'm looking for challenging fights, and thus, have little quarrel with a system that prevents me from running around killing people who provide no challenge. 
 <br> 
 <br> It sounds like you are looking for easy fights, and can't stand a system that won't give them to you. 
 <br> 
 <br> Carebear. 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I live for the whole thought that I just pissed that person off so much that they just quit the game&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> You're not only a skill-less wannabe greifer, but an exceptionally stupid one. Yes, I'm sure Blizzard is going to cater to gameplay that loses them customers. 
 <br> 
 <br> Let me guess, you're one of those doesn't-get-out-enough nerds that thinks killing n00bs in a game makes you all hardcore and badass? 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Not if the level range for able to attack others and being attacked was handled appropriately as well as a removal of any penalties if you are attacked first.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> That would prevent any 'dishonour' system from being used for reverse greifing, or letting low level players wander around and annoy high levels without the high levels being able to do anything about it. 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;PvP should be free baby! Free like the wind! But not like artificially generated wind, which actually costs money for the machinery and stuff...&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I think Blizzard needs 3 types of servers.
 <br> 
 <br> PvE
 <br> Horde vs Alliance PvP (the current pvp type servers, with the contested zones, etc)
 <br> FFA PvP (gank anyone anywhere etc). 
 <br> 
 <br> Daoc had this kind of setup, and with it's like, 4x as many servers, surely Blizzard could put in a FFA PvP server or two in each time zone to accomodate the people who enjoy this type of gameplay.
