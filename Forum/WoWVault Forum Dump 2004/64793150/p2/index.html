 <br> I suggest to the thread author that you check out Star Wars Galaxies (SWG). It's like UO 2.0.. but Star Wars <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050419075158im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/4.gif" border="0" alt="grin" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> oh and it's hella-fun if I do say so myself (that is if you don't concern yourself with jedi and spend all your time sitting infront of your computer watching yourself macro your way to success. Yep.. thats why a lot of people hate it. Well duh ah?
 <br> 
 <br> IMHO both level based and skill based systems have there pro's and cons. Skill based systems tend to be less 'strung-along-by-the-nose'. They are open ended and let you do what you want, when you want. However, some people hate not being told what to do in these games.
 <br> 
 <br> Level based is good in that case because you KNOW what you have to do next.. you need to go k3ll m0bz so you can pwn! No.. ok for some yes <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050419075158im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  But level based games aren't to bad, but they can get old quick considering in a level based game theres only one way to advance.. you guessed it.. go kill mobs!
 <br> 
 <br> Perhaps it's just cause I'm older, and mindlessly slaughtering rats so I can hit level 2 just doesn't do it for me much anymore. Hopefully the leveling in WoW will be interesting and fairly fast.. so I'm not sitting there watching my xp bar with a cold sweat and my watch taped to the monitor.
 <br> 
 <br> It's kind of the difference between (for you geeks out there) Dungeons &amp; Dragons p&amp;p game, and Vampire - the Masquerade. Because D&amp;D is a level based system, it's 80% fighting and 20% roleplaying. Vampire (and all the World of Darkness rpg's) are skill based. Anyone who has played that can tell you it's 80% roleplaying and 20% fighting.
 <br> 
 <br> It probably is that I'm older, but I look forward to MMORPG's where there are a lot of different things to do. Lot of different systems in the game, roleplaying, socializing, hunting, crafting, exploring, and then some <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050419075158im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  Level based MMORPG's just cant compete in that arena. Guess thats why I enjoy SWG so much.

People figure out the one or two most optimal skill sets, and then that is what everyone plays. Well-defined roles disappear, and those types of games basically turn into soloer games, as everyone works to have the most optimum set of skills to compete. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I like rigid, class-based games, where I get to choose my character profession from the beginning (Paladin, Shadowknight, Cleric, Shaman, etc). I love games that have a tightly defined class system and those classes have well defined roles that are designed to work together. Those systems seem to promote the most grouping and cooperative play. 
 <br> 
 <br> I also find them very fun - because I know what my character *is*, and I know what my role is. It also creates a lot less stress, for me as a player, because I don't have to worry about how to build my character, if I'll be gimped, or have to untrain skills, and whatnot. 
 <br> 
 <br> Rigid classes also seem, to me, to provide a lot of replayability. I look back on EQ and think of all the secondary characters I made because I wanted to try a different class, and see how they worked, and how the playstyle was. It was fun to have diverse and different characters, so I could play whatever struck me that moment. Maybe I wanted to sit back and relax that evening, so I play a support role like a cleric or druid. Maybe I want to be puller, so I play my Shadowknight or a monk. Maybe I want to solo, so I play my necro... 
 <br> 
 <br> Plus, there's something cool about being able to just look at someone else's avatar and KNOW what they are, like a dark elf necro, or a troll shaman. I mean.. you saw these characters and you knew what they were by the way they dressed. You could tell a ranger from a warrior just by looking. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Bottom Line - I like classes, and levels. Glad WoW has them =)

I was a HUGE werewolf player back in the day, and when you were assigned what pahase of the moon your character was born under it really only specified what special abbilities you had to choose from....  There was a great deal of freedom as to how your character would grow.  what would have made UO great would have been a system of mathmatical curves for various skillsets that said ) that if Skillset X is at  level 100 then all other sets can only ever get as high as 50...   as an example:
 <br> 
 <br> Skillset X contains all Melee combat specializations for various weapon/combat styles, and Skillset Y contains all magic, including healing, buffs, and various forms of offensive spell casting.  
 <br> 
 <br> Timmy the Crusher of Souls has just spent all his most recently skill points in maxing out 2 specific skills, one is in his favorite weapon, the human head swung by the hair, and the other is in &quot;buttwhoopin' '' fighting style, which allows for dual wielding and has special moves that involve attacks against an enemies rump, but doesn't allow the use of shields or armor heavier than light chain.  Both skills are in skillset X, and by maxing out one weapon and one fighting style, Timmy has hit the 100 point bracket for melee combat.
 <br> 
 <br>  After seriously whomping a troupe of elven girlscouts that throw poisoned cookies at you, Timmy has earned himself another 10 skill points.( they used to be worth more, but the TOTAL number of skill points a player has will always be a factor in determining how much a player gets for accomplishing anything)  He decides as the crusher of souls, it's important to be able to cast some pretty evil looking spells from time to time.  When Timmy goes to pump all 15 points into &quot;skull magic&quot; however, he runs into a little problem...  He's already put 20 points into skull magic (just enough to hurl one flaming skull at his foes, and grant him the abbility to avoid combat with low level undead beasties if he chooses) and 25 points into magic resistance(the only skill that offers blanket protection from any incoming spell-nasties).  after putting 5 more points into skull magic, the game tells Timmy he's reached the cap, and  that if he wants to continue pumping points into skull magic, he's going to have to either lower the total number of points he's put into his highest skillset, melee combat, to the next lowest bracket which is at 84 points, or drop his points in magic resistance (anything under 15 makes you an obvious target for equal-level enemy wizards, and even at 25 a high level caster can still knock Timmy stupid if he isn't crafty in his aproach).
 <br> 
 <br> If he chooses to drop those 16 points, he doesn't get them back (to stop people from power-leveling as a fighter then switching all their points to magic to be a top level wizard), but he can then raise his total devotion to magic up to 60.  
 <br> 
 <br> OH NO!!!!! trade 16 points for 10?  well, it's a way to balance things out to avoid making &quot;jack of all trades&quot; characters overly powerful....  There would always be a cost for not choosing to be REALLY good at anything, hence the concept of a curve instead of a straight line graph.
 <br> 
 <br> This kind of system can continue down with each kind of skillset having lower caps...  yes players can choose how to develop their characters into individuals, but there will always be limits to how powerful you can be, and after you've reached the max any new points can only be spent &quot;fine-tuning&quot; your skill spread to be the way you like it.
 <br>  
 <br> These examples were pulled off the top of my head so obviously there are balance issues that a programmer would have to look at and testers would have to play-through, but the basid idea is there.  Skill points are earned like exp in a level based system, but without the rigid levels that some people hate.  Characters can be customized, but overly powerful combinations are largely ruled out as people will always have to choose to either be Godly at one thing, or good at several.

However, my preference is the freer skill system because it doesn't focus on combat prowess. 
 <br> 
 <br> A major obstacle with any system is just how much the designers do about balance. It's easier to balance level-based system because it's always combat-centric. They just slap on a different system for trade skills. What usually happens is that crafters and non-combatants get nowhere in this type of game without combat skills that support the group. Instances like a reporter who has no combat skills will not be able to visit the toughest places because of level restrictions; or maybe you want to bring along a blacksmith to repair your gear on the battlefield but he doesn't have the level requirement to enter the zone.
 <br> 
 <br> In my ideal skill system, all skills are equally important and viable, and they have intricate relationships. Learning one skill may benefit another similar skill but hamper another unrelated skill. In simple terms, skills belong to categories. Using a skill in one category improve your chances on other skills in the same category. Skills in different categories may show antagonistic effects. Heavy armor slows down your casting time, for instance; or training magic-related skills earns you more mana points to use, so if you want a lot of mana points, you want to train a lot of magic skills and give up other skills. Even non-combatants can have great success in the game: maybe not as killers, but they can become great merchants and craftsmen without killing ever. They can go anywhere with an escort because places don't have arbitrary level restrictions. 
 <br> 
 <br> A close example would be AC2 where skills are divided into melee, missile, and magic. To get the best skills, you have to train the lower skills in the same category. You have the freedom to choose any skill from any skill tree, if you have enough credits, thus creating a hybrid class. Of course, generally, skill systems are even less restrictive. Something along the lines of GURPS complete with prerequisites, default skill levels (because you know a similar skill), etc., things that encourage focusing on one or two line of skills. It should be easier and faster to raise related skills. Unrelated skills may have inverse effect on your performance in another skill, thus mitigating the desire to make tank mages.
 <br> 
 <br> The toughest part of designing this kind of system is defining the types of relationships among all the skills. In general, weapon skills encourage physical combat, magical skills make one a better spellcaster, and craftsmen can do their own thing at peace and still be able to enjoy a major portion of the game. Other factors to consider are time investment, character attributes, and other game dynamics (eg, physics, speed, item attributes including weight and size, etc), to help balance the skills. A more complex system should be harder to abuse. There will always be min-maxing, but there won't be a single dominant template. You can still mix skills, however, there will be some restrictions for realism and for balance's sake. The final result is that you move away from hack-and-slash to a more well-rounded online society. It's not a game just for those who like mind-numbing gore-fests; people who like peaceful activities can also come to be productive, to socialize and to explore.

In level based systems you have to do stuff to level up (not necessarily hunting only, though that seems to be the primary focus in most games).  In skill based systems you have to do stuff to improve your skills and unlock more skills.

 <br> Skill based systems are really no different than level based systems, either way you're doing stuff to advance your character.

 <br> 
 <br> Except the ridiculous level / exp mechanics of FFXI, but that's separate.
 <br> 
 <br> FFXI gives you quite a bit of dynamic flexibility with your character and at the same time is not incredibly difficult to balance (like a straight skill-based system).
 <br> 
 <br> SB just has a very flexible system, but does lead to some &quot;template&quot; issues.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW looks like it might be shaping up to have quite an interesting system however.  Looks like general class-based for primary and secondary skill classifications, and then skill-based training for those.  Will be very interesting to see how it works in detail in beta.

The main problem being that only people specced fully in xxx skill were useful.  FFXI had some good ideas about how to make variety... but still it was not very useful other than increasing your stats.  Sure you subed a war as a pld to get provoke... thats the only reason tho.
 <br> 
 <br> While I loved AC1's skill system it did lead to balance issues (many DOT studies have been done and if i remember correctly its sword --&gt; bow --&gt; axe --&gt; war for best dot).  However to balance these our sword cost 8 credits to train 8 to spec (most expensive melee skill, bow cost the same, axe 6,6.  War magic cost 16, 12)  &lt;-- why if its not the best?  It is in pk.
 <br> 
 <br> Anyway there were relativley no melee characters later on in the game other than sword, axe, ua.  While there was staff, dagger, mace, spear) very few x-bowers existed same with throwing weapon characters, most ranged characters were bow users.  What I am saying is that there is no way to balance a skill based system unless you make everything identical in damage OR make some skill &quot;cost&quot; less to have.  (ie UA came trained on sho characters, so it only cost a total of 6 to spec, sword cost 16) This freed up 10 credits for that ua character to use on something else, while this did not balance the game, since everyone could have all required skills by 126, it helped alot.
 <br> 
 <br> Required skills in AC1 2-3(for a non mage) item, creature and life.  (item allowed you to buff your items, creature allowed you to buff your stats, life allowed you to cast damage reducing/increasing spells and recycle health/stam/mana).  Mana conversion --&gt; lowerd the mana cost of spells randomly (higher skill = higher chance to cost less).  
 <br> 
 <br> Without the 2 or 3 of the buffing magics, and mana c you were a gimp.  These skills remained constant through almost every character later in the game, most classes also took healing.  
 <br> 
 <br> While AC1's system was the best i've played yet, there is alot of room for improvment.  I don't beleive an MMO should have rigidly defined classes --&gt; ala FFXI, and to some extent DAOC.  In FFXI if you were lvl 40 and someone else was lvl 40 and you were the same class you had the EXACT SAME CHARACTER minus some items.  In DAOC most people speced only 2-3 different ways per class to not be gimped, so basically 1 out or 2 or 3 people you meet were the exact same as you.  Why do these mmo's make it so everyone is the same?  Its EASY! Yes easy, one class is too powerful nerf it, no chance of screwin up another class.  Also its easy for any player to go &quot;OH hey thats an XX class i use spell 1 spell 3 and spell 17 then melee 2 and 6 and ill win every time!&quot;

 <br> 
 <br> Nah, there were quite a few spells and abilities that you only needed ~10 spec in to be useful.  Anyways that's not the point -- each class was very flexible for how you wanted the character to develop.  Support Bard, Xbow Bard, Dagger / Black Mask Bard, 2h Warrior, S/S Warrior, Dex-based Warrior, different runes for tracking or blinding or others, etc.  Casters focused on DoTs, or debuffing, or damage, or some blend.  Quite a far cry from EQ/DAOC's stringency in class design.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot; FFXI had some good ideas about how to make variety... but still it was not very useful other than increasing your stats. Sure you subed a war as a pld to get provoke... thats the only reason tho.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> By FFXI I mean you can level up the different jobs and mix-and-match them for whatever purpose.  The actual job system itself I think is great.  However, so many other things about the game sucks (restrictiveness of PvE combat forces extremely narrow templates and so on), I don't think the job system is given enough credit.

I've never played Werewolf myself actually. But I have played (well ST'd mostly) Mage, Vampire &amp; (a bit of) Changeling.
 <br> 
 <br> Those systems have no levels. They are 100% skill based. You never level up and the only templates are your Clan/Tradition etc. Those set you up with a set of powers but by no means are you limited to them. You can learn other powers/spells/magic/disciplines etc as you advance. You advance through xp just the same but you apply xp to skill points. Increase your driving skill or your skill at melee combat or your skill at hacking a computer, or raising your powers skill.. It's a 100% skill based system. I didn't realize that Werewolf was that much different.
 <br> 
 <br> I think I'm just a rare type of player in MMORPG's. I don't need that carrot to string me along. I don't need to be lead by the hand through the game. I much more enjoy finding my own path, learning my own ways, and gaining skills that look like fun to me.
 <br> 
 <br> Yes both systems are treadmills, but skill systems are MUCH less a treadmill because your not following a linear path to the end. In a skill based system there really is no 'end' until you've learned every skill there is to learn.
 <br> 
 <br> Also I really don't like being in a static class. Yes for the purposes you can make games more balanced, give each 'class' it's set of what it can and cannot do.. how it plays with others etc. But in a skill based system you can still do that.
 <br> 
 <br> The way some people are talking about how everyone just plays 1 or 2 templates.. thats blatantly wrong. The only people who try to find those specific 'best' templates are Powergamers and PvP'ers. They make up a VERY small segment of the MMORPG population. If that weren't true SWG would have no tailors or weaponsmiths or dancers or image designers or architects or pistoleers or carbineers or smugglers.. because none of those skill sets/professions are the uber-ist.
 <br> 
 <br> If you actually look at SWG's profession statistics (granted they are now out of date) those classes which are supposed to be 'uber' only have a max of 2% of the entire player based. More people are NOVICE ENTERTAINERS then there are TKA's or Commando's or BH's COMBINED.
 <br> 
 <br> I cant comment on UO as I never played it actually. But I have heard that everyone played some kind of fighter/wizard combo. But again.. I can bet that while the powergamers and PK'ers played that.. not 'everybody' played that by a long shot.

 <br> 
 <br> Yeah, there are only like 10-15 completely different ways to spec SB classes.  In DAOC, at MOST there are be 3 ways to spec a class (with slight variation).  Most classes were in the 2-ways category.
 <br>

 <br> &quot;Why not take a middle ground? Level &amp; Skill based game?&quot;

 <br> Yarr.  That is how Blizzard's done it in the past (for D2, I know different groups, whatever).

When I think of a class system I see there being at least three different groups of skills/spells.  First group are skills/spells that your class gains automatically.  These are basic class defining abilities like the ability to wear plate armor, or certain spells like heal for a priest.  Then there are skills/spells you can choose to develop that only your class can choose.  Then there are the abilities that most anyone can choose to develop.
 <br> 
 <br> Now there may be some choices to make and different pools of skill/spell/proficiency points to spend on these various groups.  
 <br> 
 <br> Now certain class specific abilities may be so crucial that they essentially become class defining but that just happens.  
 <br> 
 <br> Also I don&#8217;t like systems where you have to continually develop the same spells over and over(ala DAOC)  As you become more powerful you should learn different spells/abilities not just numerical improvements to current ones.  
 <br> 
 <br> Spells could evolve. Example, that bolt spell can over time increase range, increase accuracy, increase damage, increase AE component, increase dot component, and decrease cast time.  A really cool system would allow you to customize your spells.  Maybe even having a customizing ability to develop.  Allows flexibility and uniqueness.  Granted balancing is hard but it can change over time.

WOW I raised my sword skill 30 points today! WOW I gained 8 levels at that new hunting spot. People need to readily see the rewards for their actions or it is turned into a grind. Strictly leveling-wise, I MUCH more enjoyed going from 1-40 in AC than 40-80. Why? I saw less improvement going 40-80 for the amount of time I put in than going 1-40. Constantly seeing the swirling mists around me let me feel like I got something done. I don't have a problem with leveling or skill-based systems. I don't have a problem with getting into the upper middle level/skill ranges. The problems come when the game I play puts to much emphasis on the HIGHEST level or the HIGHEST skill. The fact that higher level character are almost assured victory strictly because they are higher level. The fact that I can only weild that sword with a skill of EXACTLY 325 or more. Then I feel like I HAVE to keep pushing past what I'm currently at in order to stay competative when I know I won't enjoy it as much.
