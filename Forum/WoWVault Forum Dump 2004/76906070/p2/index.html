				I would disagree with the idea casual gamers won't cough up the monthly fees.
 <br> 
 <br> I am not sure what catagorizes a casual from power gamers though I would say I am more casual than power myself. I think of it as a way to enjoy my down time on the cost of 1/2 the price of a soda each day(.50).  
 <br> 
 <br> For appealing to friends, mostly budget minded people, it is usually an easy sell.
 <br> 
 <br> The tough area is this: Presenting to people a computer game with mass people who have never experienced such OR complexities of non Mario Brothers type action. 
 <br> 
 <br> What has made the sell easier to friends is GQ, Men's Health, playboy, Field and Stream and T.V. all advertising such games which gives the impression many like minded people of such crowds play these type games. (Kinda takes it outta the old &quot;nerd&quot; context and thus making a player base of &quot;casuals&quot;.

				Venom I think you're misunderstanding what I wrote, go back and read it again =D
 <br> 
 <br> B.net is a great service, but I was referring to the people that can't see that it does not approach the same kind of commitment to hardware, bandwidth, debugging and ongoing development that WoW does and there for can't understand why it can't be free like B.net.

				Exactly. Their definition of &quot;gaming&quot; may not contain the words &quot;interactivity&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> Their definition of gaming might be something they would like to do at their own terms and their own space - home. Without the need to connect to the web, and having to deal with.... people.
 <br> 
 <br> Dealing with people isn't an easy thing to do, there are many people who prefer moments of solitude, and they may be the same people who play games, minus online.

				I think so far that Diablo has actually provided the best example of a game that could appeal to casual and power gamers alike.
 <br> 
 <br> You can get on an play the game, complete it, play it a few more times till you get bored.. or you can keep running it over and over in harder difficulties to go ahead and collect better items.
 <br> 
 <br> Regardless, I've got hopes that WoW can strike a nice balance =D

				&quot;The main problem with this is that every casual gamer I know can't get passed the monthly fee.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I disagree with this. Most people I know are casual gamers and none of us has money problems. We are all adults who work white collar type jobs and make a decent amount of money. The problem we have is that in most games we simply can't level as fast as power gamers because we are busy. Blizzard is catering to us and I am all for it. ;-)

				Im a casual gamer and i have a PS1/Gamecube/Xbox/5 computers and a laptop. I just play on them much. I also have an active account on UO/EQ/AC, dont play them much either, i just dont have the heart to kil them after spending sooo many years in them, but i think the wife getting tired of me having htem and not playing them hehe, so they will be gone soon i suppose.
 <br> 
 <br> The thing i like the most about MMO's is the social atmosphere. For us casual gamers a MMO is a neverending game, my wife likes the fact that i save money playing MMO's, even though its a monthly fee.
 <br> 
 <br> Ive got to have almost EVERY single player game made on packed shelves and boxes at my house, but that died out alot since UO hit. I have only completed maybe 10 single player games in my life, but i always just trudge along in MMO's becuase i know there is no hurry, the game never ends.

				I can buy into the Multi-player aspect keeping people out.  My girlfriend loved City of Heroes, but she wound up quitting.  Not because she disliked the multi-player aspect, but more that she just did not care about it and I think that is a key thing to consider too.
 <br> 
 <br> When UO first came out and along with older MUDS, the huge draw was the neat, novelty concept of being able to log into a world and adventure with people across the globe (even if it was lag-a-licious).
 <br> 
 <br> It's not really a novelty any more, there is none of that running into the other room to grab your room mate and drag them in so they can see you killing a dragon with 7 other people.
 <br> 
 <br> People know about MMORPGS now.  I'd wager to say it's pretty difficult to be a gamer and -not- know about Everquest or Ultima Online.  It may be not be the fact that playing with other's keeps them away but that they just don't care.  In a single player game they can do as they wish, mod what they want and cheat as much as they want too.  A casual gamer might wonder why they should give that up just to play with people they don't care about, and to pay to do it on top of that.
 <br> 
 <br> I do think there is some room to grow in the market.. it's really only been since the growth of the PS2 that it's become socially acceptable to call yourself a gamer.. and it really only seems to be the last 2ish years that MMORPGs are starting to break away from their stigma of being geeky.

				I know a lot of technically oriented people who have no trouble at all paying for decent gaming systems and nice cars who feel that paying for CDs is rediculous when they can download music for free.The idea of paying anything at all monthly to play a game is outright repulsive. If they can't copy it and steal a key online then they don't want to have anything to do with it because they feel the gaming company is trying to rip people off. People, you can't make stuff like this up. Is this a retarded point of view? You know it!

				I have a great paying job, without putting an exact figure on it since I'm not into bragging, I have more than enough money left over every month after paying for a nice house in southern california, paying for my 350z, my wifes Maxima, all bills etc, to pay for as many games as I want.  I make enough money to build my own top of the line gaming rig for myself and my wife every year...  Gaming and computers are my (and my wifes) hobby, and I spend a lot for my hobby.
 <br> 
 <br> And yet I'm a casual gamer.  I only play maybe 2 or 3 hours a week night, and maybe 5 if I can squeeze it on the weekends.
 <br> 
 <br> A friend of mine works even longer hours than I do, makes a good deal more than I, plays even less, yet pays for games at the same rate as I do.
 <br> 
 <br> Casual gamers don't exist?  You wish.  If we didn't exist they wouldn't design games with us in mind.  I guarantee you my income is greater than that of most power gamers sitting in game for 10 hours a day.  My responsibilities in life are high, but I still have time to engage in the things that make me happy.  And personally I'm glad for my wife and my job, and not being a power gamer.  I've seen some of these people that call themselves power gamers.  I couldn't imaging living with the unprincipled, undisciplined, unhappy lives they seem to lead.  This certainly isn't all power gamers, but a good enough percentage of them that they make an impression.  I'm sure not all casual gamers have money and are happy either.  But to claim casual gamers don't exist?  Fantasy.

				Well, my definition of a casual gamer is that regular shmoe who owns a console or two and has a decent computer and of course has a job. The person will buy a game, beat it, never touch it again, and occasionally play a two player game with a friend or sibling. The person has a decent computer and a few common games such as counter strike, starcraft, etc.
 <br> 
 <br> Low-commitment player is actually more accurate for the people who have no problem shelling out money for a top of the line computer system and usually have a family etc. I know personally many people like this.

 <br> My wife has 3 boys from a previous marriage and I love em.  I do have to admit though that I'm glad I didn't have to go through changing their diapers =P
 <br> 
 <br> They all love FPS games, but they dabble in MMO's as well.  I love FPS games as well, but since I've been playing MMO's more in the last 5 years they completely own me now =P  Every once in a while I get a game here and there where I whup em, but its rare hehe.

				My defination of casual gamer is:
 <br> 
 <br> A person that spends most of his/her time complaining about how it's unfair that people that put in more time have better stuff than them. 
 <br> 
 <br> They always want the easy way out and want everything handed to them.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Makes me wonder why the &quot;casual gamer&quot; even considers buying a MMORPG if they know they won't be able to put the time in with their RL responsibilties.

				How I always though of Casual gamer is some one who will not play more than a couple hours on weekday and maybe few hours on the weekend. People who have jobs, Family, gf/bf and active social life. They can't spend 4+ hour camping a spot or do a raid cause they have to leave a set time. The way the Raid work will be great for people who can but 3 hour in to area but over a period of 5 day they can do the raid. The fact that you can almost solo mean that they can level with out wait hour to find a group or bother people to help them do some quest. This time of thing where they are not require for them to be on the computer for hour may attract them to play this game. 
 <br> 
 <br> I play FFXI this is by far the most hardcord game I play. It would take me hour to get group to get and it would take hour to get at least one level. This type game can't appeal to some one who can only play few hour a week. This how I define it and I don't believe money is an issue but rather it time they have and can use is the issue.

				&gt;&gt; And yet I'm a casual gamer. I only play maybe 2 or 3 hours a week night, and maybe 5 if I can squeeze it on the weekends. 
 <br> 
 <br> I play about the same or maybe a bit more. That's not a casual gamer. At 20 hours a week you are starting push into hardcore territory.

				Once again I should state that the money defining aspect of a casual gamer is not how much money you have but if or if not you are willing to devote that to paying a subscription fee for a game and understand why you have to do so in order to play that particular game.
 <br> 
 <br> If time is your only constraint, you don't fit in the horde of masses that the Dev's are speaking about when they're trying to crack that market.

				Typically in the past when people cried to make the game more for the casual gamer. It was actually a plea to make the game for a lazy player. When it boiled down to it they were really advocating the ability to wtfpwn people by putting in some fraction of the time of people willing to really work on their character.
 <br> 
 <br> When they use the term &quot;compete&quot;, it is actually a thinly veiled attempt to actually mean &quot;wtfpwn&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> DAOC is a classic example of this. How many threads were started with people who whine TOA was not for a casual gamer and that they cant compete. The truth of the matter was they couldnt dominate anymore but they could truely &quot;compete&quot;. I chose to not do TOA and I instead focused on building a template around Spellcrafting. Surprise surprise I could easily compete but could not dominate all the time.
 <br> 
 <br> So when you hear about people crying about casual gaming it is most likely they are crying about making the game for a lazy player so they can just get in and wtfpwn people without putting much of anything into their character.
 <br> 
 <br> If you want that then go play CS. These games are called role playing games for a reason.

				I don't care how many hours someone plays.  
 <br> 
 <br> I like the idea of someone who comes to play for 2 hours a night/week, and they can play and compete and beat down on someone who plays 60 hours a week.
 <br> 
 <br> Thats what playing a game is about.  
 <br> 
 <br> Michael Jordan didn't keep all his points from every game he ever played and put them on the scoreboard for his team before the start of the game.  He came into each game to play that game as best he could and encouraged others to put forth thier best efforts.
 <br> 
 <br> When I think of 'power gamer' I think of someone in an unhealthy mental state.  I think of someone who derives self-worth from spending an incredible amount of time trying to advance their 'score' so that there can be no competition.  
 <br> 
 <br> I think of someone who is afraid of challenges and competition whenever I see the label, 'powergamer' now.
