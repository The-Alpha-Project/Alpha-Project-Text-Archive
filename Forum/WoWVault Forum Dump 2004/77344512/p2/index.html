				There are PLUSES and MINUSES to everything you do in this life.  Online gaming is a fun, cheap and easy hobby to have.  I've played MMOs for over 5 years now and I can honestly say that it hasn't impacted my real life at all.  I didn't meet my wife on an online game but she watches me and is interested in playing now that she had a chance to fish in WoW at Booty Bay area.  She loved it.
 <br> 
 <br> When I was single I went out on the weekends and blew over $100.00 a weekend easy eating, doing shots and drinking.  Not to mention the money I spent bar hopping all over the place.  It got expensive as heck and the people that were my so-called friends (drinking buddies rather) only wanted to party and stuff.  It got old and EXPENSIVE!!!
 <br> 
 <br> My wife asked me why I don't have any guy friends that come around to hang out and just go do stuff with and I just replied to her, &quot;Just watch and see and you'll see why I don't have buddies like that.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> So after 1 year she came to me and said, &quot;Honey, I finally understand why you don't have any RL friends but many associates.  Their problems become yours and you are somewhat obligated to spend time with them, money on them and invest your feelings and emotions amongst a whole bunch of other stuff.  Just not worth it because not many people remain your life-long friends anyway.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> By the way- I have a 2 yr old at home that sits on my lap when I play and she's good at picking stuff out and counting numbers and stuff.  She likes the graphics, the sounds and the environments.  Very beneficial to her.  I don't mind it.
 <br> 
 <br> To each his/her own.  I have no regrets playing MMOs at all.  VERY cheap hobby and I don't have to go out in the cold just to have some fun.  I have my treadmill and other exercise equipment in the house so I can just watch TV or craft stuff while I run with my cordless keyboard.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041023013546im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> MMOs will be around for a long time to come.  Just think of all the people that want to socialize and have the friends and not have to spend hundreds of dollars to throw a party and have people over to trash your house.  Besides, in WoW you can hit the Tavern(s) and get drunk all night long and don't have to worry about drunk drivers (whether it's you that is drunk or another person).
 <br> 
 <br> Just a fun and cheap way to really entertain yourself just like the millions of kids that are playing games.  Besides, I REFUSE to grow up anyway and I'm NOT a Toys R' Us kid either!!!

				&quot;If you ever would prefer to play an online game instead of being with real people for any extended period of time, you really have to do some life revaluation. Seriously, a few hours here or there is fine. Once you start kicking into 5 or 6+ hours a day, theres something wrong. Something else is suffering for all that time you're wasting in a game. Relationships, friends, social skills, health. Those are really important things to have. And No, dudes that you never meet in real life are not friends. Times are changing though. Maybe you don't need to know the person to be friends with them=) Everyone has their own definition, hehe. As an invincible teen that doesn't look more than 1 day into the future, you may not believe it, but hey, we're not your mommies and daddies. If you're an adult. Sorry, wouldn't want to meet you in real life because it would be a scary experience. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Good game man, we'll played.  Except not true.  I revently moved about 3000 miles from my old home for a job, and will be moving back in a few months.  I havent met anyone my age (19) since the people I work with are all 30+, and bars/clbus isnt an option because teh drinking age is 21.  I get on vent and talk to all my buddies from home, including ones I've met in other games, and play WoW with them (soon..)
 <br> 
 <br> I definitely consider these people my friends, and real friends.  I'm sorry you have to see someone IRL to be a friend, maybe you are shallow and need to judge the person by how they look.  I met a guy in FFXI and hes hilarious, I'm going out to california before flying home to visit him for a few days, its gonna be awesome.
 <br> 
 <br> I see tons of benefit to online games, as long as you make time for other stuff too.  I agree that maybe 5-6 hours+ a day every day is too much, but the odd day with your friends 6-8 hours isn't bad, sometimes you just have nothing to do on a sunday.
 <br> 
 <br> And btw the priest comment was hilarious.

				MMORPG's hurts more then helps for the most part.  The benefits are you can make ebay money and it's cheap entertainment.  They don't help social skills at all though.  Sure you talk to people ingame annonymously that isn't hard but how does it improve your RL conversations?  You can't tell the person at the store how you hunted some video game monster they have no clue what you are talking about but if you talk about how you played a basketball game or went to some party then they know what you are talking about.  You can only share the experiences with people you don't know over the internet so it's pointless.

				Whats most scary is people actually do talk in real life they talk in a game.  Hey, freaks are freaks=)  Looks don't really need to matter to those not interested in joining society.  Hey, if you can get by day to day without dealing with those considered socially acceptable, more power to ya.  
 <br> 
 <br> Some of us grow up and others are still locked into that highschool attitude about &quot;perception doesn't matter&quot; crap.  Good luck buddy.  In the real working world, perception is reality even if you don't believe it.  In other words, you're judged on looks, attitude, and basically how you present yourself.  Whatever is going on in that mind of yours doesn't really matter.  Playing videogames all day long doesn't help in those regards one iota.  Dealing and socializing with all types of people, IN PERSON, does.
 <br> 
 <br> Perfect example.  Typical freak IT guy.  Depending on the company you're working for, good luck getting a job if you can't communicate properly or get along with people.  Too much gaming distorts your view on how people deal with others.  You think you can get by treating real people the same way you do online?  Just look at the message boards;)  I feel sorry for some of these guys here.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm a mentor for interns, so its my monthly fun session with them;)  They really just don't realise how important perception is.  Some get it.  Many don't want to get it and well...they don't last long.

				I think I was lucky...I didn't start playing games till after college.  I got good grades, participated in wild parties, met the ladies, all the good stuff.
 <br> 
 <br> Then I got married and settled down a bit.  Friends got married, moved away, ect....things have slowed down now.  Games help my imagination and I always felt imagination was good.  There are bad effects from playing games--especially if you are in college and start losing out on grades (and parties and the ladies, ect.)  But I also think games are way better than TV, doing drugs, ect...and keeping you off the streets.
 <br> 
 <br> One thing that has helped me most from playing games...is my typing.  It's so fast now and I swear I can get 2-3x more done at work now.  However, seeing all the dood speak may have hampered my editing skills, as I see all the poorly written, mispelled crap from these boards and in games, when I see it at work I knock it up as being normal--not good!.

 <br> You should join a local gym... great way to meet people your age and get in shape. Otherwise, maybe there is a college in your area? If there is you can go to the clubs that cater to the 18+ college students... I don't care where you are you still need to get laid every once and a while or you start to feel sub-human. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041023013546im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">

				 I play online games, a LOT. I also have a job, and a fiance. I also have several aqariums that I maintain at home. I find time for all of it but still manage to play 4-5 hours a day.
 <br> 
 <br> I have had much more fun with in game friends, than most people not in game.
 <br> 
 <br> There are only so many times I can go to bars, see the same crap, the same people, and do the same stupid stuff that it gets old.
 <br> 
 <br> But to some people, spending 100 bucks on beer/liquor a weekend and then throwing it all up is a good time.

				Most people here seem to think that if you play games your social skills and abilities to dress drop durastically.  I am a network administrator for one of the biggest companies in north america, and I'm 19.  I can dress perfectly well, and get along with everyone here.  I have little to no difficulty making friends in person, I love going to bars and getting sloshed, spending the night with the friends etc, I just also like games.
 <br> 
 <br> I've met tons of friends in real life, and I've met tons of friends in games, and enjoy spending time with both equally.  Whether it be going out or playing a game, I find both fun depending on my mood.  None of my real life suffers because of games, with the possible exception of lack of sleep once in awhile.
 <br> 
 <br> Gaming has helped improve my typing speed vastly (which is now well over 100WPM) and my language skills.  Being exposed to conversation continuously through a game (or forum) also improves your vocabulary.
 <br> 
 <br> The people who spend ALL their time in games, and never go outside or meet people, and have serious social shortcomings are a different story.  I think they should stop playing games a bit and meet people, obviously, but I still think they get some benefit.  Their are socially inept, but at least they get to talk to a few people online, get some attention... imagine they never got any at all, that certainly wouldn't help them get any better.

				the biggest benefit for me is that playing an MMO is a lot cheaper than keeping up with my other hobbies. I mean modding cars isn't exactly cheap. I spend a lot of time playing WoW but I still have friends and I have a fiancee that I didn't meet in game. And it's a hell of a lot better than watching tv in every aspect. 
 <br> 
 <br> And the social side of it has benefits for people that wouldn't be going outside and doing stuff anyways. There ARE people that simply don't want to go out with people. Yes it's a problem but if they aren't going to go out with others for whatever reason playing an online game is better than nothing. At least they have to learn to be able to talk to people reasonably to an extent and not be a complete jackoff because if you do that then you have not only no RL friends but no ingame friends either and then you are screwed. 
 <br> 
 <br> i.e. there are good and bad effects from gaming online. 
 <br> 
 <br> TV sucks.

				MMORPG's hurts more then helps for the most part. The benefits are you can make ebay money and it's cheap entertainment. They don't help social skills at all though. Sure you talk to people ingame annonymously that isn't hard but how does it improve your RL conversations? You can't tell the person at the store how you hunted some video game monster they have no clue what you are talking about but if you talk about how you played a basketball game or went to some party then they know what you are talking about. You can only share the experiences with people you don't know over the internet so it's pointless. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Exactly what I think.
 <br> 
 <br> Their is a common language barrier in the social agenda.
 <br> 
 <br> You can only strike up conversations and talk to people based on what you know, and what you think they know.
 <br> 
 <br> People generally in social situations just want someone to give them some attention and to take turns talking about **** that really doesn't matter at all.
 <br> 
 <br> Well when you play MMORPG's, you limit your knowledge to whatever you did or know in the time you WEREN'T playing mmorpg's.
 <br> 
 <br> This is the problem I have, I spend a lot of time playing these stupid games, then when it comes to social situations, I don't have jack **** to say, so I just stay away from them rather than waste my time.
 <br> 
 <br> But this doesn't mean I cant make up **** and lie about my life, lol, to fit the social agenda.  That always works.

				Please do not assume all players that socialize online are avoiding working on their 'fear' of RL socializing.  Some have physical disabilities that limit their ability to effectively communicate and socilaize in RL... but a keyboard and others online can actually facilitate interaction!
 <br> 
 <br> We all like to distill issues down to black and white, 2 sides of a coin, etc... but the truth is that RL is never that simplistic.

				When I was in the military, I would go clubbing every night.  Usually to more than one club a night (figure $5-10 cover charge each place).  
 <br> 
 <br> Include drinks, typically $50-70 a night.
 <br> 
 <br> I lived in the barracks, so I would get a hotel room if I hooked up.  Figure about $30-40 for a room.  At least twice a week.
 <br> 
 <br> Recreational suppliments, typically $100-150 a week. (ToS prohibits details, use your imagination)
 <br> 
 <br> We won't even mention food, gas, tickets (I drive fast) or anything else you can think of.
 <br> 
 <br> Compare that to playing AC every night for 4 years.  Game cost $29.95 plus 48 months x $9.95 ($10) = $480
 <br> 
 <br> I've sold numerous AC accounts as well, earned roughly $4,000.
 <br> 
 <br> I've managed to save well over $25k since I started playing MMO's in 1999.

				The ones I have to laugh the hardest at. (and there are many to laugh at here) are the ones saying.. gaming is bad for you go get drunk..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Look I dont drink never have, never touched any drugs, dont smoke, did not use caffine till I found out it helps my migraine headaches.
 <br> 
 <br> If you think gaming is bad for you what do you think Drinking is.  So the only way you have any social skills is if you are drunk?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Theres not one legitimate benefit at all. Honestly, unless you're in such a physical state that you can't do anything besides read or watch tv, an online game is the clsest thing to meeting people. Even then, there's no one real in there. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> You need to define benifit... 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Oh.. and this Idea that people are not REAL online.. is pretty funny.
 <br> 
 <br> Lets think about this.  People are Fake.. or have a mask up, no matter what.  In rl... for sure.
 <br> 
 <br> In game at leastm you know they are telling you what they want you to THINK about them.  In some ways they are being more honest.  I think you can learn alot about people from what they tell you they are.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> And this concept that just because you play alot you have no social skills is not to thought out.  The two things have nothing in common.  I am a wedding photographer.  I do 3 weddings a week or so most weeks.  I get ENOUGH social interaction with people haha.. I may not type like you want me to but in RL.. I can smooze pretty much anyone and make them think I am what they want me to be...(that is the key to SOCIAL skills by the way..)
 <br> 
 <br> Humans have a habit of wanting to pigeon hole things... fit all things into neat little boxes.. and it just does not work when applied on a larger scale.. 
 <br> 
 <br> Not all gamers are social misfits.. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Ok... one last thing..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> So when you talk to people on the phone are they REAL people... if you write letters and mail them are they REAL people..  
 <br> 
 <br> The thoughts and IDeas you exchange are the REAL part of people.. not the physical BEING..

				&quot;Um... get a clue... these games are REALLY BAD for people with no social skills. They will never get better. 
 <br> 
 <br> If you can't go out with some people and carry on a good conversation good luck with the rest of your life. If you have this trouble you BETTER get out there and learn how to converse with people or your future will suffer. 
 <br> --------------------------------------------- 
 <br> Considering there is much social activity in these games, your point is pretty weak. Typically, you can socialize with more people in a game than you could at ANY event. And with an &quot;anonymous&quot; type setting, what better place to practice your social skills? &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Sadly, typing to people online does not equal social skills. Interacting with lifeforms through the internet and in real life is a totally diffrrent ball game my man.

				Yes it is different.. that does not make the online thing meaningless.. it is different..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> When the phone came out.. did people.. have this conversation..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> well talking to someone on the phone is pointless.. I mean if you dont see them face to face what you talk about means nothing..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I am not saying.. it replaces human contact.. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Actually it can lead to people telling you the truth about things they would not other wise tell you.. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I do know one thing.. people that are a JERK... are more likly to ACT a jerk online then in person.. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Sometimes I think you get to see more of the REAL person.. when they know you dont know who they are..

				Talking with people in different parts of the world that you would never have meet other wise is crap?
 <br> 
 <br> I have noticed one thing.. about people online.
 <br> 
 <br> They have no SCALE... things are either.. uber leet killer great.. or they SUCK.. are lame and useless..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> you never see someone say online... well that is OK... not to bad... pretty good..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> ALL emotions get over driven.. good or bad.. people expose their.. mean streaks..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I work at home.. and am stuck on this Mac on my desk.. 8 - 10 hours a day... SO.. I have a PC on the desk beside it.  The PC is logged into a Game all the time I am in the office.  This does not mean I am activly &quot;playing&quot; that whole time.  but I am logged in 8 - 10 hours a day during the week.  I get as much or more work done this way then I would NOT logged in.  for one thing I dont go nuts sitting here watching the hour glass thing on the mac while it does a photo shop operation..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> The interactions of people.. are their Ideas... and emotions.  I personaly think these are passed fairly well online.  For you to say they are not would be like saying poetry and litrature are not able to pass emotion or Ideas.
 <br> 
 <br> No they are not the same.. 
 <br> 
 <br> BUT...
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> If you can have BOTH.. I think you are better off.. there are things you say and do in game.. that you would just not say or do in RL.. .there are people you meet you would just not meet in RL..
 <br> 
 <br> If music (recorded not live) can exchange emotion.. and Ideas.. and Books can..
 <br> 
 <br> Why not online ..
