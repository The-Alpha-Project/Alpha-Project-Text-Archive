				I have always viewed the elite monsters as equilivent to players really. There are regular monsters which players mow down, which undoubtly an elite monster could as well. Imagine elite monsters are basically other players (without the player mindset). That is why they should be just as tough and making it fairly ineffiecent for leveling solo on them. It would just take to long.

				I play a mage and this change won't affect me.  I never use the polymorph then eat/drink technique.  Since polymorph makes the enemy heal up quickly (or is supposed to), I can only see this being useful on multiple enemies anyway.  If that is the case, then it would only take a little longer to kill one, run away to heal up, then come back to kill more.  If there's something I'm missing, let me know.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923160646im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">   I'm ice specced, so that's what I use mainly for crowd control.
 <br> 
 <br> I can, however, see this having a negative effect on Priests since groups probably won't want to stop and wait for them to regen between fights.  It also means that they will need to really focus on mana conservation.  Items that add to spirit will probably become even more valuable than they already are.

 <br> 
 <br> I'm not sure it works they way you think it does.  I took the word &quot;engaged&quot; to mean that the monster has aggro.  Just because a monster isn't attacking you directly and you're not attacking it doesn't mean you don't have any aggro.  Healing causes aggro as well as damage and protection spells.  We'll have to see if this is what actually triggers the eat/drink prevention.
 <br> 
 <br> When you polymorph a mob currently, you cannot go invisible because you still have aggro.  I imagine that the eat/drink function will be based on the same thing.

				&quot;also when You are in Combat you cannot eat or drink. 
 <br> not your group just you. so get out of combat untarget the mob and eat/drink. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> That all depends on how they count you in Combat.  Maybe they mean your Group.  Because they have stated repeatly that Food/Water was ment to reduce down time, NOT as a means of regening during combat.
 <br> 
 <br> Personal thought: If they are increasing the Elite mobs isn't that gonna make it REALLY REALLY hard to do on 1 mana bar.  They've got a lot of balancing to do because 1 mana bar for either healers/priests is going to make dungen crawls VERY Slow.  The likely hood of going OOM is very high espically with ADDs. There's a large amount of mobs that run once they get low on Life and add more mobs.  
 <br> 
 <br> It will be interesting to see what they do and how it will work.

				My husband I and both have mages and duo together all the time.  Sometimes in camps, more then 1 mob comes.  We've gotten up to 4 actually.  We use polymorph for 2 of the mobs and use the sit and drink/eat method to regain as much mana/life as we can before that polymorph breaks.  
 <br> 
 <br> Taking this away will now make this method, as well as our duoing quite pointless unless we stock up big time on mana potions.  That would give me horrible DAoC flashbacks of having to bring 25 power pots out each night to RvR <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923160646im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/19.gif" border="0" alt="plain" hspace="0" vspace="0">

 <br> It not only creates more downtime, it almost forces you to group with more people, thus making it take longer to level in the long run.

				The eat/drink change will make life hell for healers.  As a druid, I have frequently been the only healer in pickup groups, struggling to keep up with the healing.  When grouped, I spend all my time either HoTing or drinking, and it's _already_ hard to get people to wait for you after a fight while you drink up.
 <br> 
 <br> When the game goes live, that will improve a bit; I can make sure that I only group with people who understand that you don't go charging into the nexst fight in another room while the sole healer is trying to get some power back, but I am definitely not going to enjoy holding people up while I wait for power.
 <br> 
 <br> If I cannot drink while my groupmates are fighting... well, that'll be pretty miserable.
 <br> 
 <br> It also kills my root-dot-drink strategy for higher level mobs, but that's less of a big deal.

 <br> Gah, one of my biggest pet peeves is groups that don't account for these given their abilities.  Paladins have a stun that works great on runners, Warriors have hamstring that works even better.  I imagine other classes, besides those with range like casters and priests who should be dropping runners as a high priority, have other means of slowing down runners.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm not saying that mistakes don't happen, or that everyone should be playing at their peak ability all of the time, but not to account for these situations with the tools provided drives me nuts.

 <br> 
 <br> Groups should be punished for overexerting themselves though.  Mana/Power management has been a staple of these games for a long time.  Honestly, you shouldn't be the only healer, at least not out of combat.  Warriors and Rogues should have food to eat after combat, instead of you having to keep them at full health all of the time.  I think almost every warrior is going to go with first aid once they know how nice it is <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923160646im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> If, after every battle, everyone's full of health and you're out of mana, the group should discuss migrating some of that resource decay to their health bars, instead of dumping it all on your mana.  That way, they can share the regen time by eating food, using potions, or using bandages.
 <br> 
 <br> I like it when a group can make a concious decision to expend themselves to the brink, but stock up on food and bandages in order to do it.  It's the tradeoff for higher level encounters.  I'd never seen this tactic used before, so maybe I don't get the implication as much as those who lived and died by it.

 <br> 
 <br> &quot;So id like to repeat the questions about what will the system consider &quot;In combat&quot; in terms of the new upcoming changes. Also, like asked... what if a tank in the party is fighting, but you havent touched any enemies yet (but you were previously low on mana from another encounter) does this mean you cant get the benefit of a drink or some food? I think perhaps this &quot;In combat&quot; shouldnt apply to the full group, but the individual. This would help to stop people from soloing things they werent intended to solo... but also encourage people to work together in groups a bit more, in my humble opinion. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I will answer this question - but I really have already answered it above. In your specific example, you would be able to continue to eat/drink because you have not engaged the monster. I am not going to answer anymore detailed questions like this though, everyone can just wait and see how it works. There is no point in me detailing a 10 page FAQ on the topic <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923160646im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  &quot;

				&quot;Honestly, you shouldn't be the only healer&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Sometimes you can't help but be the only healer in a group. If healers aren't on, they aren't on and you make do with the classes you have and do the best you can with your abilities. I think the majority of groups, especially pick up groups, would love to have even ONE healer, much less two.

				&quot;Gah, one of my biggest pet peeves is groups that don't account for these given their abilities. Paladins have a stun that works great on runners, Warriors have hamstring that works even better. I imagine other classes, besides those with range like casters and priests who should be dropping runners as a high priority, have other means of slowing down runners.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> You mean the stun that has a one minute cooldown?  The Pally stun, quite frankly, sucks.
 <br>

 <br> 
 <br> Sapphy is right on point.  This change is really going to make Pick Up Group 10x harder to complete quests and instances.  The grouping feature currently sucks and I am really hoping they improve it.

				The people complaining about this change really don't get the point...
 <br> 
 <br> For any given encounter, anyone with mana was only ever intended to have a certain amount of it.  That's why drinking during combat is being removed.
 <br> 
 <br> You were never ever intended to be able to have almost unlimited mana during combat.  This makes any mana based class over powered.
 <br> 
 <br> Encounters are designed based on the fact that the people attacking the mob have a certain skillset.  The devs know approximately what abilities the players will have so they can plan the difficulty accordingly.  With the old system, the devs had to assume that mages have unlimited mana.  This means that all party members have unlimited health.  So basically, all your players will live forever if you have enough healers.
 <br> 
 <br> With eating and drinking during combat in the game, the only way the mobs in high end encounters can win is to do rediculous amounts of damage.  What I mean is single or double shot kills.  It's the only way they could possible win.  This type of gameplay gets old really fast.  It's not that much fun working your way to a boss mob only to be killed in one shot.
 <br> 
 <br> With eating and drinking removed, the mobs don't have to do as much damage.  With there being a good chance that the player won't get a heal (because the healer is out of mana) the fight can be a lot more dynamic.  The mob doesn't have to one shot kill people because the damage it does is not trivialized by a healer with unlimited mana.
 <br> 
 <br> You have to realize that the game was never designed with the ability for casters to have unlimited mana.  The mobs aren't designed for it and unlimited mana completely removes the devs ability to design encounters.  This isn't a feature that the devs intentionally put in game and then removed.  They never intended for players to drink during combat.  Because players are doing it, they have to remove their ability to do so.
 <br> 
 <br> If after reading this you still don't get it (or simply don't agree), then there's nothing I can say.  This change absolutely had to be made.  It's literally the difference between a game where all encounters are the same (and easily won) to a game were encounters can be different and challenging.

				I'm not in beta either, but theres a reason why healing/retore items didn't work in combat before in past games and won't work now in WOW.  It makes everything too easy.  It looks like players might have to think a little more instead of charging into battle knowing they have an almost endless supply of restoring.  Groups will have to think more.  Tactics, thinking and strategy.  Yeah.
 <br> 
 <br> The MMORPG veterans get it and the newbs seem to be learning it now.  Too many players already have mentioned how easy everything is.  Blizzard is listening.  I couldn't have imagined they meant for food/drink to used durring combat in the first place.

				<i><span style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Honestly, you shouldn't be the only healer&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> Sometimes you can't help but be the only healer in a group. If healers aren't on, they aren't on and you make do with the classes you have and do the best you can with your abilities. I think the majority of groups, especially pick up groups, would love to have even ONE healer, much less two. </i></span>
 <br> 
 <br> I do believe I tried my best to specify that I was speaking of out of combat means to healing.  Jesus, you even cut off my statement at the comma and quoted me out of context.  There's absolutely no reason why an entire group, when out of combat, must rely on ONE person to heal their health, when food, bandages, and potions are available so easily.
 <br> 
 <br> I apologize if that wasn't clear in my original post.  Obviously, groups make due with what they have...hell, I've been the only healer in my group before and I'm a Paladin.  All I was saying is, with all of the means of healing outside of combat, there's no reason that an entire group should make you the healer.  Especially when, at the end of combat, everyone is full of life, and your out of mana.  At that point, when it would be much more efficient to have a few people at half life or more eat food for 10-20sec, or hell use a bandage in 3 secs, there's no reason not to.
 <br> 
 <br> I've spent most of my MMORPG career making the best out of &quot;bad&quot; groups.  I enjoy it quite a bit, accomplishing things with a bad group makeup that shouldn't be able to be done, so I know what it's like to make ends meet when you're not an optimal group.
 <br> 
 <br> All I was saying is, this game provides many other avenues to heal out of combat, compared to other games that force players to either be healed by a priest type, or sit and mend naturally.  Not taking advantage of that as a group, and using that as a reason against this change doesn't seem right to me.

				&quot;If, after every battle, everyone's full of health and you're out of mana, the group should discuss migrating some of that resource decay to their health bars, instead of dumping it all on your mana. That way, they can share the regen time by eating food, using potions, or using bandages.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> That's all fine if you're playing with people you know and trust, but I haven't even been in a WoW pickup group yet that actually assigned a puller and/or any kind of roles, never mind bothered to figure out who has what tradeskills <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923160646im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0">   That's part of the reason I've been grouping as little as possible until I can play with my friends and put together decent groups.  Not only do I hate struggling to get enough power to keep these suicidal maniacs alive; I hate to be the person holding the group up while everyone sits around and waits for me to go from zero to full.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;You were never ever intended to be able to have almost unlimited mana during combat.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Whether on my warlock, priest, or druid, I have never at any time felt like I had anything close to unlimited mana.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I am disappointed in this change because I thought that minimizing downtime was one of the things that Blizzard was doing right.  Hopefully it will work differently than it sounds.

				Thats why grouping should REQUIRE someone to take the lead or at least require the members to talk out a strategy.  If everyone is just attacking away and wining, yet no one really has a job, how shallow is the grouping system?  VERY shallow.  
 <br> 
 <br> In previous MMORPGs, whenever I was in a pickup group, I asked who's doing what or what I needed to do.  If I get no answer, I take the lead.  If no one wants to listen and just blindly run into battle, I leave.  Its pretty simple.  During low levels, groups are naive, so learning how to play together is part of the fun.  If no one is grouping early on in WOW, like I keep hearing, THAT'S a problem and a major weakness for a MMORPG.  It creates a population who doesn't undestand the group dynamic and just fosters a dislike for grouping in the first place becasue no one knows what they're doing.  The whole game has to rely on MMORPG veterans to teach everyone instead of the game teaching you from day 1.
 <br> 
 <br> Funny how a food drink discussion can bring up grouping=0 Whoops

				Grouping in WoW is currently VERY badly done.  I think they should correct that issue before messing with drinking/eating which is going to destroy pick up groups.  Fact is, it's hard to get a group w/o spamming the global chat.  There no good system to find a group, and the quest system makes it difficult to find people that are on the same quest as you.  Many quests have 3-4 different parts (sometimes more) and not many people will go back and do previous parts.

				20 seconds is not downtime.  20 seconds is time for a little social interaction, whether in character or out.  I am playing a game right now with pretty much no down time, and the ineraction is horrible.  If you have no dowtime, you pretty much have a FPS with levels.
 <br> 
 <br> Mana convervation is a good thing.  If players don't have to conserve mana, casters become too powerful.  If there is a single class who can insure that casters have as much mana as they want for free, that class becomes an absolute requirement for high level content.  Perhaps one of the reasons the warlock is seen as underpowered right now is that they have in-combat mana regen.  Remove that from other characters, and the balancing becomes better.
 <br> 
 <br> As much as I don't want WoW to be 6 minutes between fights, I also don't want it to be a mindless game.  Now I'm not in beta, so I can't be sure, but so far it sounds like the way things stand, if you have a warrior with a sheild, a preist and a mage you pretty much just steamroll every encounter.  Throw 2 other members into the group if you like, but it doesn't matter much what they are.

				&quot;In previous MMORPGs, whenever I was in a pickup group, I asked who's doing what or what I needed to do. If I get no answer, I take the lead. If no one wants to listen and just blindly run into battle, I leave. Its pretty simple.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Right now, if you leave, that means you get the quest done later or not at all, after travelling 5 minutes and waiting for the group to gather for 10.
 <br> 
 <br> Right now, it's easier/faster to just suck it up and deal with bad groups.
 <br> 
 <br> Sometimes, it doesn't even feel worth it to spend all this time organizing the group for a few fights that are close, but over quickly, because the group's just going to break up as soon as the quest is finished.  You spend more time in prep than you do in the encounter.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm not saying that's a good thing, at all; it's not.  It's just the way things are.  I agree that it needs to change.  For a long time, I thought the solution would just be open release, and that probably will solve the problem for me.  I know I am going to have a good guild to group with once the game goes live.  That's not going to solve the problem for the true newbies who aren't bringing groups and guilds from other games.

				God forbid you can't kite and there's actually some challenge in the game.
 <br> 
 <br> I don't understand why people are complaining about this, if you want to be an overpowered slaying machine, this isn't the game for you, I'm sorry.
 <br> 
 <br> See any First person shooter, or Diablo I + Hellfire or Diablo II + Lord of Destruction.
 <br> 
 <br> If you want the challenges of character developement and using the full extent of his abilities to do well and progress while making friends and establishing economy and community, then this is the place for you.
 <br> 
 <br> It's not a 'nerf.'  It tweaking.  It's what Beta is for.  It's why this game will not be another DAoC (in reference to overpowered slaying) or another EQI (in reference to kiting).  DAoC and EQI lacked 'challenge.'  Grinding for hours while establishing a set strategy of kiting, pre-structured groups, etc. was what made it bland.  These changes are steering WoW away from this type of gaming.

				Everyone should reread gpouliot's reply because he pretty much explained why this change must go through. I agree with his comments on this matter 100%. 
 <br> 
 <br> If things continue as they are then let's just get rid of the mana bar (since it's pointless)...
 <br> 
 <br> Why even have a numerical mana cap for different classes if you can just pop food and drink pretty much anytime.

				For those of you who aren't in beta, you can't just eat/drink whenever you want currently.  First of all, you must sit down while eating/drinking, and if an enemy attacks you, it interrupts it.  It definitely does not feel like infinite health/mana, it just allows regeneration at times when battle is still going on, but you are not currently being attacked.
 <br> 
 <br> The main players this will affect are those that use polymorph to gain time to eat/drink and those that like to eat/drink in a group during battle (generally healers, who by nature are reactionary and are not always actively using abilities).
 <br> 
 <br> Obviously if it was not intended for this to happen, then it wasn't intended.  It doesn't matter if we agree with it or not.  It's a correction, not a nerf.
