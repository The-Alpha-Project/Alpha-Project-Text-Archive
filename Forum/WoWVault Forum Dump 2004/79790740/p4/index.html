 <br> 
 <br> Pros
 <br> <ol>
 <br> <li>Beautiful game on the higher settings as long as you are looking for that &quot;realistic&quot; look.</li>
 <br> <li>Some animations are done really well, spells effects look great.</li>
 <br> <li>Character creation is pretty good, with loads of options.</li>
 <br> <li>Quests have a good amount of variety to them early in the game.</li>
 <br> <li>When in a good group, its pretty darn fun, and looks great with all the swords and spells flying.</li>
 <br> <li>The beginning levels are pretty fun and the voice acting is above par, even if you don't always want to wait for the person to say everything they need to say</li>
 <br> <li>Felt like I was participating more in a story than a series of quests like in WoW, like my character might actually have an impact on the in-game world.</li>
 <br> </ol>Cons
 <br> <ol>
 <br> <li>While beautiful in some aspects, there were many places where everything just seemed to bland, especially in the cities. I would describe it more as a fake RL world than its own world. Didn't have enough feeling to it.</li>
 <br> <li>Despite having all the character creation options, for some reason they don't seem to change the look of your character enough to really be worth it in most instances.</li>
 <br> <li>Need to have a group for the game not to be extremely difficult and a long, boring grind. I like to be able to log in for a 90 minutes and get something done and have some fun in-game.</li>
 <br> <li>Loading times are a pet peeve of mine, even for 10-20 seconds (even in games like HL2), they detract from the game and ruin the immersion, and EQ2 is full of loading times.</li>
 <br> <li>Some of the animations bugged me.  Like the running+strafing animation where your character faces straight, but slides left and right.  Just wierd.</li>
 <br> <li>Even high end systems will have trouble in certain areas, like in towns for instance.  Its almost to the point where I would consider changing my video options based on where I was going in-game</li>
 <br> <li>You don't choose your skills, they are giving to you when you level, so there isn't really different between characters in the same class at all.</li>
 <br> </ol>
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;">WoW</span>
 <br> 
 <br> Pros
 <br> <ol>
 <br> <li>Doesn't have the realistic look, but still manages to look amazing somehow.  Has a great many artistic touches in the game that just feel right.  I feel like I am playing in the WoW world, not a world trying to imitate the real world.</li>
 <br> <li>Plays well on even medium to medium/low systems. My 1.8Ghz, 512MB, 32MB GeForce 440 laptop still ran WoW at 1024x768 with most of the options at medium levels and it ran extremely well.</li>
 <br> <li>Great quest system, but at the low levels, the quests can be quite monotonous, most of them being &quot;Kill 10 and come back&quot; type quests.  However, the quests later in the game get much, much better.</li>
 <br> <li>Crafting system is streamlined and easy to get into, while not being overly easy.  If you put enough effort into your craft you can create items very useful for your own level, saving you money and keeping you well equipped.</li>
 <br> <li>Combat is fun and exciting.  Even when I play my Paladin, which is supposedly one of the more boring classes, I can take a fight different ways.  Do I use my blessing with a chance to stun? Do I use one with a faster attack speed, or use the judgment to increase holy damage for another blessing?</li>
 <br> <li>The ability to solo is awesome.  I play MMORPG to be in a living breathing, changing worlds.  Though I may spend most of the time solo, I still can group when I want to.  If I wanted to play with other people all the time, I would play Counter-Strike online or Champions of Norrath with some buddies.</li>
 <br> </ol>Cons
 <br> <ol>
 <br> <li>Still a prevelance of bugs for a released game. Quest NPCs that will chase after a mob and then no longer give out quests until a GM can come fix them.  Quests that become broken under certain conditions and won't work until a server restart.</li>
 <br> <li>Things like mail lag can be quite annoying when you have to sit at a mailbox for 5-10 minutes just to send one pice of mail.</li>

Better game and way more immersive.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ has &quot;quest&quot; in their name, WoW put quest into their game. WoW again, hands down.
 <br> 
 <br> A lot of people posting here say they have both games and give various reasons. Some people don't really know why they support EQII, maybe brand loyalty or something but they say they are just checking out WoW.
 <br> Maybe they will find they are playing WoW more than EQII but will still support EQII on the boards as the better game. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041222131922im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> What will start happening is that you will sit down in front of your computer and you will see two icons. One WoW and one EQII. Slowly over a small period of time you will start clicking the WoW icon more often than not. Even though you know EQII is the better game you can't help yourself. You just want a little bit of fun for a few minutes and then &quot;damn, where did the night go?&quot;
 <br> The next day you keep posting about EQII being the better game and that night when you get home what do you click on? &quot;Dang, wtf, another night of WoW&quot;.

Getting around was a PITA because I'd played WoW during the ST and knew what it felt like to get around without zoning (much) and what hitching a ride from one area to another was really like. Add to this if you didn't have a good group up and running soloing sucked hard. 
 <br> 
 <br> Rather than solo I worked on my gathering skills; forestry, mining, gathering were at 126 and trapping around 115. If you know anyone who worked on their gathering skills they can tell you what was involved in raising these skills. 
 <br> 
 <br> I enjoyed guild groups for the most part because I didn't have to deal with a lot of whiners and noobs, but even this was not enough to bring joy into a game that was lacking this. After having played the open beta I can honestly say that had I not hitched up with a group of power gamers I would never have touched EQ2 with a 10' pole. I had pre ordered the game and thankfully they foobared the shipping on the CE editions so I ended up with a regular version- less money wasted.
 <br> 
 <br> Many people cite the graphics as being so superior in EQ2 as to make WoW not appealing. My response is this: If all you really care about is the graphics, by all means enjoy your time in EQ2. For me the fluid graphics in WoW are more than enough, and the gameplay is heads and shoulders above EQ2. If anything the one and only way I believe EQ2 to be superior to WoW is the user interface. That's it. 
 <br> 
 <br> Many people have valid points as to why one is better than the other, but in the long run it boils down to which one is more fun. In this WoW has no peer.

To put it simply, we have fun everynight in WoW no matter the amount of time we have to play each night.  As in EQ2, we were pissed and arguing every other night, and the game is just not worth it. Sure graphics were &quot;ooh&quot; &quot;ahh&quot; the first week, but after that the gameplay just seems lacking, and we find ourselves back to the &quot;grind&quot; and dealing with loot whores.  Shared exp penalty was dumb, and the raid in the game currently are so unbalanced and broken it's not even worth it.  You would think in a full PvE game, SOE would have that perfected by now.  I mean that's all you got to look forward to in EQ2, and they still can't make it right.

How they will pan out over time remains to be seen, but from everything I have heard I expect the gap to only widen.
 <br> 
 <br> I have opinions on all aspects, but the number one thing WoW has over other MMOs is **QUESTS** 
 <br> 
 <br> They're not only amazing, but they reward you massively, and can provide the sole source of xp and coin to get you through most of the game, literally without ever killing a non-quest mob if you so choose.
 <br> 
 <br> However there's a lot of misinformation in this thread that I want to clear up.
 <br> 
 <br> Earlier someone said this:
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;WoW has a very dry and weak quest system&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> And later this:
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Yes, [EQ2's quest system is] much better.
 <br> - I can get quests from different sources.
 <br> - There are push and pull quests
 <br> - quests that originate from drops. Keys, books, poems all spawn quests.
 <br> - Some quests are riddles that you must decipher. 
 <br> 
 <br> So far in WoW the only source of a quest is an NPC with a huge question mark over their head. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> These people simply haven't played the game for long, if at all.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW has all of the above and more. In the first 20 levels in the Human starting area alone, you can: 
 <br> - You can fish up a &quot;message in a bottle&quot; that starts a quest. 
 <br> - You can read about a captured general on a bulletin in lakeshire (but get no quest for it), then go save him, escort him out and talk to him at the end which triggers another quest.
 <br> - Kill a random Defiasbandit who randomly drops a letter that uncovers a plot (follow through with the clues in it to start a quest). 
 <br> 
 <br> Hell, you can get quests from all freakin' over the place - not just people in town with gold excalamations.
 <br> 
 <br> And many WoW quests are *insane* too:
 <br> 
 <br> - I did one that appeared to be a &quot;delivery&quot; quest: Go get a fossil from a senile old archeologist and bring it back. But when I got there his excavation site had had been overrun by golems. Being a crazy old man, though he obliviously lead me around anyway looking for the fossil. As he went he chatted about silly things or stopped to look through tents while golems spawned out of the walls and rockjaws jumped from the riggings to attack us. If you survive the gauntlet, and beat the juggernaut that spawns as he's climbing back out of the site, he remebers that he gave it to someone else and sends you there. Dry?
 <br> 
 <br> - In an undead camp by a sacrifical altar there are two books on pedestals. If open one you get a quest from it. If you open other, an arm comes out of it and slaps you a'la Evil Dead.
 <br> 
 <br> - In a cave you find a hibernating druid (part of the story). If you wake him he'll ask sleepily to be lead to town for he's been sleeping for hundreds of years. But as you go, he keeps falling back asleep on you (complete with falling on his face animation and a little &quot;zzz&quot; effect) and you've got to gaurd him from corrupted forest animals until he wakes up. And of course, upon saving him he kicks off another quest chain.
 <br> 
 <br> - I was asked to leave &quot;poisoned&quot; food by a blackwood furblog campfire that would purify them if they ate it. When you do so all of the furbys nearby wander over to it and &quot;poof&quot; become friendly npcs. Then their leader - a satyr - spawns very pissed off, /shouts to the zone that nobody messed with his underlings and attacks you. What's really funny is you can go find your &quot;freindlified&quot; furbolgs wandering around the forest for at least 10 minutes afterwards.
 <br> 
 <br> And here's the real kicker:
 <br> These are all in the same zone: Darkshore
 <br> They're all the same lowbie level range: 15-20.
 <br> 
 <br> There are literally dozens more there, too. Search sunken pirate ships. Investigate washed up sea creatures. Climb a necromancers tower, or get mushrooms from a naga cave. There are dozens of escorts, encounters, dungeons and bosses mixed liberally in the &quot;kill X of X&quot; and &quot;take X to X&quot; quests - even at the lowest levels.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW quests are anything but dry.
 <br> 
 <br> I won't even get started on the amazing instanced dungeons and the crazy quests and encounters associated with those.

Personally, I tried Everquest II (after anticipating the game for a number of years), and cancelled it within the first 2 weeks.  World of Warcraft (which held no interest for me prior to it's launch), is the game that is currently causing me to rush home after work every night and play.
 <br> 
 <br> Everquest II did not capture me like WoW does.  I did not like the fact that on my high-end system, EQII ran sluggishly in highly populated areas.  World of Warcraft plays flawlessly on my PC.
 <br> 
 <br> In EQII, I did  not like the fact that, as a Human Priest, it is very difficult for me to progress in levels without having a group.  Yes, I know MMORPGs involve other people... but I should be able to choose when I want to group and when I want to play solo.  WoW allows me to play as I want, when I want.
 <br> 
 <br> Everquest II felt like work to me... crafting, adventuring, questing.... nothing held my interest.  In WoW, I don't even look at my XP bar... I am having fun, and if I happen to level at the same time, even better!
 <br> 
 <br> But most of all is the artwork.  To me, everything in Everquest II looked washed out.  I like the World of Warcraft graphics... it LOOKS like a fantasy world.
 <br> 
 <br> Mind you, everything boils down to personal preference.  For me, WoW may not have reinvented the wheel or added anything new to the MMORPG genre, but it did manage to do everything very well.

 <br> EQ2 has superior graphics, quest engine, music IMHO.  But, I prefer the ease of gameplay WoW offers me, the casual gamer.

 <br> Everything in EQ2 is work, nothing comes easy, from money, to gear, to guild levels etc.  It is all one huge time sink.

 <br> 
 <br> In WoW, you can play and play for hours and never once feel the need to look at your XP bar. You can quest and quest, I've been playing WoW for a year now and sometimes  i'm still surprised when I level, because your so immersed. Leveling is a by product of grouping/questing and having fun in WoW.
 <br> 
 <br> It's the exact opposite in EQ2, you can log in for 2 hours and not get a single thing accomplished. I did get a monk to 32 in beta...spending 3 hours LFG? no thanks

 <br> 
 <br> ------------------------------------------ 
 <br> 
 <br> WoW has been released in the North America only: 88 servers&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Hardly a fair comparison given that the EQ2 servers carry several times the number of players that the WoW servers do, due to instancing of most of the zones.
 <br> 
 <br> I have both games, will keep EQ2 subscribed for the month just started and will then review the devs's progress on things like European server transfers, additional solo content, fixes for crafting etc.. It's early days with WoW but it looks like I'll be sticking with that anyway, it seems more complete and rich on detail.

It's fun, but there are a few things that Blizzard did that really erked me.  That being: 
 <br> 
 <br> 1) The stat bug that gimps certain classes which is &quot;working as intended.
 <br> 2) The instanced zone loot bug which is &quot;working as intended. 
 <br> 3) PvP is a joke.  
 <br> 4) Grouping is a joke.

And at my level, being a healer, it's not easy to solo, nor is it worth my time. So I get on today, having to be at work in just under 3 hours, and I realize, I don't have enough time to get anything done.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> If you have problems finding a group as a healer, I shudder for the other classes. 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Supposedly they're adding some serious solo content in the near future so I want to hold out, as eq2 does a lot of things I REALLY like, the graphics are amazing to me, having voice acting was cool, I like the instancing as I was easily able to traverse the noob zones and do quests on launch day, etc.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I'm sold on WoW but I will try EQ2 at some point in the future. The game will probably be more solo-friendly and the engine better optimized if I wait six months. I wouldn't be surprised if they speed up leveling after 20 also. 
 <br> 
 <br> Competition will make EQ2 a better game in the long run.

 <br> Its amazing what the public will put up with and how they think just because game dev's redo what amounts to the same code and call it a new game its somehow &quot;better&quot;. Can't anyone come up with something original for once? Both SOE and Blizz are big time company's and the best they can do is throw us canned code and more of the same?

 <br> I'm staying with neither one of them.
