I beta tested for 2 months + 32 hours of retail gaming.  The gameplay philosophy of the developers, overtime, alienated me from a &quot;casual&quot; perspective.  I tried to adapt, but failed.  At low levels I could accomplish my goals within a short period of time, but later levels really started to slow down too much for my tastes.  I like feeling some sense of accomplishment, even if it only means completing one quest/task. 
 <br> 
 <br> Techinical points: the graphics are amazing and I love the voice overs.  You really do need a good computer to enjoy the visual beauty. 
 <br> 
 <br> Misc points: I hated the crafting system, too confusing.  The class system is pretty good, but diversity is a little too subtle within each base (fighter, mage, rogue, priest). 
 <br> 
 <br> Overall: great game for people who enjoy the EQ line of gameplay design. 
 <br> 
 <br> Switched to World of Warcraft over the Thanksgiving Holiday.  I did not enjoy the Stress Test, but still felt compelled to play retail.  As I leveled up and started exploring areas, the game became highly addictive.  The PvE system is more enjoyable than EQII.  Crafting is accessible to everyone.  By this I mean fun and streamlined.  We have a real incentive to learn skills.  
 <br> 
 <br> Technical points:  WoW could use more graphic options, but my system runs flawlessly on high settings.  I love the artisitc style.  People who complain about the cartoonish aspect are strange.  I still watch Looney Toons on Boomerang/Cartoon Network, so  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041222131914im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">  
 <br> 
 <br> Misc. points:  I focus more on the adventure than the actual leveling. 
 <br> 
 <br> Overall: I haven't experienced this level of fun since my early Ultima Online days.  I'll stop rambling my opinion now.  Shut up and play! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041222131914im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0">

 <br> 
 <br> major differences in the 2 that made me choose WoW over EQ2:
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 1. casual gamer friendliness: WoW &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EQ2 - EQ2 actively punishes and negatively reinforces the hardcore gamer mindset.
 <br> 
 <br> 2. forced grouping: in WoW you group because you WANT to, in EQ2 you group because you HAVE to.
 <br> 
 <br> 3. lack of tactical combat and dull game mechanics in EQ2: the wheel is a poor excuse for stripping down and restricting all decent combat tactics. i really didnt like it.
 <br> 
 <br> 4. WoW has a better quest system. its simpler, much more indebt and much more accurate then EQ2, you can actually get decent rewards from doing solo quests.
 <br> 
 <br> 5. EQ2 = endless grind.
 <br> 
 <br> 6. overall WoW IS fun, while EQ2 is work that you have to do in order to have fun.

People who are unwilling to point out major flaws or weaknesses in their game of choice. I immediately discredit any response or reply that lists only good about a game, because the viewpoint is obviously not objective. Nothing is perfect, by no means is WoW perfect, in a thread where you are to compare two things you have to be prepared to accept and point out the flaws and bonuses of each side to come close to making a valid argument. Otherwise, it's all just a sterile argument.
 <br> 
 <br> Take the comment of WoW having a more indepth quest system, I'm sorry but did you do any questing in EQ2? WoW has a very dry and weak quest system, it's easy but it has the diversity of McDonalds fries, small, medium or large. There just isn't much RP atmosphere in WoW, not to mention so many things were placed into the game that practically detract from it. Is it really so hard to understand that when it comes to an RPG maybe WoW isn't the best choice out there? You like your PvP and what not and maybe WoW is the best in this genre for that, but it's time to just settle into reality that maybe for specific types of gamers this isn't the best there is.
 <br> 
 <br> There is more in this world than WoW, there is yet even more coming down the road. To say WoW is a masterpiece and the symbol of perfection in the MMO genre demonstrates either delusion or ignorance, and if you can't even make an objective analysis of 2 games than I truly do pity you, because sorry, but that is what is referred to as a &quot;fanboi&quot;.

Got my character up to level 20 and enjoying it immensely - very addictive.  Agree with the comments that its a group orientated game (with xp grind the most efficient way of levelling) but then again what is the point of playing a MMO by yourself.  Appreciate some people prefer the solo option but I find that with EQ2 there is never a problem getting a group.  My guild is going to play WoW and I will join them for sure.  Played the WoW US beta only briefly and thought it was pretty cool - very slickly put together and much easier to pick up than EQ2.
 <br> 
 <br> To answer the thread question, I will stay with EQ2 until WoW hits Euro retail, then I will move over.  If things don't work out in WoW I know I can go back to a very good game that is EQ2.  The main reason is the guild I'm in.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041222131914im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">  (Saying this, i've joined a superb guild in EQ2)

 <br> EQ2 system is just as weak as WoW to say. No MMO I've played has a lot of involving quests. Are you saying EQ2's quest system is better? You gotta use the stupid NPC find on all NPCs for quest almost. They go straight through walls and can't find anything. WoW really isn't that much better but gives better directions.

 <br> 
 <br> I couldn't have said this any better.  The quest system in EQ2 is a much better system all around than the WoW system.  And I am not trying to say &quot;EQ2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WoW&quot; or &quot;WoW is t3h suck...lolbbq I am s00 l33+&quot; either so calm down fanbois.
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Are you saying EQ2's quest system is better?</span></i>
 <br> 
 <br> Yes, it's much better.  
 <br> 
 <br> - I can get quests from different sources.
 <br> - There are push and pull quests
 <br> - quests that originate from drops.  Keys, books, poems all spawn quests.
 <br> - Some quests are riddles that you must decipher.
 <br> 
 <br> Should I go on?  So far in WoW the only source of a quest is an NPC with a huge question mark over their head.

 <br> 
 <br> Dont have time for both.
 <br> 
 <br> I would like to make a few points..
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> People who say the art is bland and the graphics suck...
 <br> 
 <br> Well.. Im going to say something mean.. Shove it. 
 <br> You have no right to say graphics suck on anything. You have the right however to say the graphics are not your type.  
 <br> 
 <br> That is the biggest problem many people have with Wow. they do not like the cartoonish looks. I don't like the cartoonish looks. I prefer the more realistic, dreary aspect that EQ2 gives.  Wow seems more happy and bright, while EQ2 is darker and more realistic seeming.
 <br> 
 <br> You can like whichever you like, thats fine, but don't say it sucks.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Forced Grouping..
 <br> Yes it is forced grouping, but thats the main reason to play a MMORPG... A Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game.  
 <br> Soloing is doable for short times in EQ2, is it as effective? no, but its doable.  I play an online game to meet people, play with people, and have fun with people.  I don't pay a monthly fee to play alone.  Now with Wow, its basically grouping isn't important at all. You can progress many times faster solo than you can grouped, at least in the times I played (I got to 34 in beta)  In all that time, out of all the people I asked to group with, I only got 3 duos going to just hunt with.  Now getting a group to go kill an elitequest, that is different and was possible.  But to just hunt exp, groups in wow are very difficult to find.  
 <br> 
 <br> You might say EQ2 is forced grouping, but on the same page, I would say WOW is anti-grouping at least through the levels Iplayed.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Grind...
 <br> EQ2 has a steep progression hill, there is no doubt about it, but to many people, that makes every level that much sweeter.  Im only level 14 in EQ2 due to my time in game, but ive never found myself &quot;grinding&quot; I just run around and do quests.  I group when I can, and solo when I don't have time.  Just last night I got into a group, it started out as people helping me kill some mobs for a quest, and it ended up being, us at the bottom of a dungeon slaughtering things way too hard for us.  Fun! 
 <br> Wow..Wow is more of an inclined plane than a hill.  the pace of leveling in WOW is ubelievably fast.  I was level 10 in 3-4 hours playing the first time.  I was level 34 in 3 days /playedish about, not exact.  There is already a max level in Wow after 9 days or something, thats insane.  IT comes down to personaly preference, I prefer slower leveling, because it makes it that much more sweet.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Overall its just your personal preference, and people, you have no right to say, it sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks.  
 <br> It doesn't suck. You just don't like it. There is a difference. ok?
 <br> 
 <br> thank you.

EQ2 = grind.  It's a 2nd job.  Sure, lots of depth, but takes forever and a day to do anything.  Takes forever to feel like you've accomplished anything.
 <br> 
 <br> The selling system is far worse than EQ1's bazaar, because you have to stay online, have to zone a lot to get to players, and have to pay for an inn room to do it.  The inn room is otherwise worthless.
 <br> 
 <br> Combat in EQ2 is the usual turn on autoatk, with the combat wheel thrown in to mess things up (it's worthless in groups, because anyone can screw it up).  
 <br> 
 <br> Graphics are fine for the world, but since you don't really need to explore much, you don't get to see much more than the same for the first 25 lvls.  Add to that daily downtime, trouble finding groups that don't add massive debt, and lack of soloability, and you have yourself a 2nd fulltime job.  EQ2 = work.  And you're paying for it, not getting paid.

If they're too easy they generally have the lifespan of a fly, I prefer some grinding to it honestly. Not the DAoC style of grinding, mind you, but some at least, so I can achieve something actually. Now, EQ2 is hardly as much of a grind as people are saying here, so I wonder who here has even played it, and if they did, did you play it completely wrong? Get a few people, and do quests, even past 30 if you know what you are doing the grind is hardly a grind at all.
 <br> 
 <br> As for combat in EQ2, it's pretty much the same if not better than WoW as you have more at your disposal, at least when you get up in levels to around 20 or so. If you turn on autoattack, as you say, good luck killing anything worth killing, no wonder you hated the game. You don't even need the combat wheel if you know how to use your skills and those of your groupmates, though the wheel always helps and gives you something to strive for. But you know what? Most these PNC MMO's are all simplified combat, and that includes WoW, come on, WoW's combat system is hardly inspiring.
 <br> 
 <br> If PvP is really your driving point, if casual gameplay and easy advancement is what you care about, then why play WoW for that matter? PNC PvP is still just preschoolers PvP, you want real skillbased PvP go pick up PS, otherwise you're just hitting in the minor leagues, sorry.

 <br> 
 <br> I also believe it is much deeper than WOW, in the sense that there is so much more to do than just slash mobs.  From the housing system, crafting system, merchant system, quest system, they are just all more deeper than what WOW has to offer, in my opinion.
 <br> 
 <br> I also like the fact that EQ2 is designed from the bottom up to be played as you level, and not intended to fly through all the content to get to to top level.  Both companies spent years developing all the content between level 1 and their max level.  The fact that people in WOW can blow through that in a week is a major concern for me.  The biggest design staff in the world can not keep up with that kind of content usage rate.  I think ultimately WOW will be attractive to people interested in PVP.  I think PVE-focused players will find themselves having run out of things to do in short order.  I don't think the key to MMOG replayability is telling people to role new toons.  I think it is having the depth there the first time through.  And for ME EQ2 does.  There is so much for me to do.  From focusing on doing all the quests I can do (and make no mistakes about it EQ2 has a lot more quests than WOW), to focusing on guild advancement, working on special quests with special honary rewards, acquiring items for my person and house... I simply haven't even begun to exhaust the amount of content there in EQ2.
 <br> 
 <br> Don't get me wrong, WOW is a fine game, and enjoyable.  If the two games didn't come out at the same time, it is highly likely I would be playing it, and playing it a lot.  But, given the choice between the two, and knowing I prefer to play an MMOG for the long-term, and that I find PVP wholly lacking in MMOGs, it was an easy choice for me.
 <br> 
 <br> By the way I don't buy into the entire cliched casual gamer friendly title thrown around to WOW.  It is deceptive, because it is almost like people are really saying lazy friendly.  If a game doesn't allow you to max out top level in two weeks, it is somehow not casual friendly.  That is a silly assesment of what a game is and is not friendly to a casual player.  That is a game that is friendly to a non-MMOG player. Real MMOG players, casual or hardcore are not looking to max out the game in a month.

EQ2 is full of zones which all have relatively long load times.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> To me it feels more like a living, breathing world than WoW does.
 <br> Load times are not long. Takes me about 15 seconds max.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I HATE games that force you to do things (EQ2 forces grouping, PvE, lame quests, etc.). Atleast with WoW, you can choose which quests you want to do, to PvP or PvE, solo or group, etc. I also like WoW faced-paced gameplay compared to EQ2's gameplay which is pretty slow.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> There is not forced grouping. You can solo all the way to 50. And the devs announced that they are adding more solo content. At the current stage it is easier to group. But then it should be. And you can choose what quests you want to do in EQ2 as well. There are 3 quests that you have to do but aside from that you have all the choice. And the EQ2 quests are more fun than WoW. At least so far.
 <br> 
 <br> That said, I was given a quest in WoW recently that pretty much forces me to group to finish. I got most of it done and it was a pain and I died a helluva lot. But I can't finish it without grouping.
 <br> 
 <br> In the early levels I have advanced far quicker in EQ2 than I have in WoW.

 <br> The main reason I'm not playing EQ2 now is I don't have that much time. Takes a while for me too get in group and I only have 2-3 hours to play a night. Takes 30-60 mins to get in a good group. I don't like crafting in EQ2 or most MMOs so crafting system and part of merchant system doesn't count. Housing is crap too me since I don't craft   and don't spend time in it I don't have one. Grouping is not as good as soloing in WoW. With EQ2 soloing takes way too long compared to grouping. Can't we get a balance between them...

Im a very curious how many customers there can be left out there with WoW sucking 250.000+ from other games in just a week. Even EQ and EQ2 must be feeling the pressure from that massive a launch.
 <br> 
 <br> I hear that AC1 has had its population almost halved by WoW's launch and its not like they had a lot of people before. Same thing propably happened among the remaining 5000 AC2 players.

 <br> Atm, WoW's subscriber population is probably 500,000+ and only growing but we won't know for sure till Blizzard releases more numbers. WoW after all had the highest day-one total copies sold in PC game history so it's safe to assume that currently their subscriber base is huge. There's 88 servers and all of them are usually medium to high populations on average.
