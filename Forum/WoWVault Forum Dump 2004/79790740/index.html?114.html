 <br> 
 <br> However, I did try EQ2 because most of my friends wanted to play it.
 <br> 
 <br> I was in WoW beta since April so I got a lot of experience playing WoW.
 <br> 
 <br> My first opinion of EQ2 was that it looked like DAoC only with more polygons (and better water).  My friend quickly pointed out that I simply had to turn up the graphics settings.  I did that, and I must admit that the game looks nice with all the bells and whistles turned on.  The only unfortunate thing is that even with a 3ghz system with 2 gigs of ram and a 5900, my system is not enough to run the game with most of the bells and whistles turned on.  I'm not faulting EQ2 though...  I spent a fortune upgrading my system to play AC2 (of all things).  I'd do the same for EQ2 if it interested me.
 <br> 
 <br> My main issue with EQ2 is that it doesn't feel like a living breathing world (when compared to WoW).  EQ2 is full of zones which all have relatively long load times.  The capital cities alone are just a bunch of zones all tied together.  I wouldn't mind so much if the zones didn't feel so self contained.
 <br> 
 <br> For me, going up to a big impasible object (a huge door) and clicking it to get to the next zone really sucks.  It's the exact same thing as running up to a dock and clicking the bell to get to a zone.  It doesn't feel like traveling through a city at all.  What makes it worse is that they could string the zones together in any way they want.  Clicking the big door could just as easily transport you half way across the world as it does put you outside.  The zones really don't feel like they're actually right beside each other.
 <br> 
 <br> I also really don't like the fact that everything is instanced.  I can understand why they're doing it, but I still don't like it.  It really removes me from the game when I try to leave the city (by clicking a big door again) and then I have to select which instance I want to play in (and coordinate it with my friends).
 <br> 
 <br> There's more, but not really much point in going over it.  In the end, if WoW didn't exist I'd probably play EQ2 and enjoy it.  In a lot of ways, it's step above other games.  However, I find WoW to be a much much better game.  It is a lot better at immersing you in the world.  It really feels like you're exploring a world instead of playing a video game.  EQ2 doesn't do that for me at all.
 <br> 
 <br> GP
 <br> 
 <br> P.S.
 <br> Most of the people who wanted to play EQ2 (over WoW) are now playing WoW with me.  In fact, some of them have thanked me for basically forcing them to give WoW a try.  All but one of them have canceled their EQ2 subscription.

 <br> Played EQ2, got my Inquistor to Level 20, then WoW came out and Im currently L22 priest. I will be sticking with WoW. But funny, both games are very similar, but is more fun to play and easier to be able to get things done.

 <br> 
 <br> EQ2 does look wonderful, but the engine isn't very optimized.  If you have the bells and whistles on that really makes the game stand out then it lags, I have a 2.4Ghz, 1Gb Ram, and an ATI9800 Pro 256.   Even at Medium there was noticeable lag in slightly crowded areas.  Though my computer isn't the best I really didn't expect performance that was that bad.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ2 also has voiceovers that I must say were very nice and I wish WoW had it.  It just kept every NPC encounter fresh.
 <br> 
 <br> Now what didn't I like about EQ2?  The combat wheel.  It was just repetitive.  You HAD to use it to kill even con creatures without giving yourself too much trouble.  Then to do that it generally degraded into you spamming the same attack combo over and over, only stopping when one missed to wait for it to come back up.  Maybe it was just me but I didn't find combat too involved or interesting, though the effects were nice.
 <br> 
 <br> Forced grouping and the group exp penalties also shied me away from EQ2.  I don't mind grouping, in fact I love it, but generally I get into pick up groups unless my guild is in the same area as I am and requires me.  So to be punished by other people doing stupid things just didn't float my boat.  Way too many things came in groups too, even the simplest of kill quests on even con or lower was difficult because two or more critters would come at you and for whatever reason they would destroy.  I checked around and did have good armor and a weapon for my level, and I don't think I was doing anything necessarily wrong, but having snakes kick my arse just wasn't fun.
 <br> 
 <br> Now for WoW.  I didn't try tradeskills in beta, but in retail I am an herbalist and alchemist and finding it very rewarding and actually fun.  Since EQ, DAoC, and others I never found a tradeskill which I could enjoy, mainly because to pay for it you had to wait till you were higher levels and then you would be stuck in a town for hours &quot;catching up&quot; making worthless trinkets and dolls until you could make that piece of armor.  In WoW I was making potions for 1cp (the price of a vial) right off the bat that would heal me a bit, up my armor, etc.  Though nothing great it was near instant gratification and for that I enjoyed it.  I actually want to get to the next level to see what I can make next.
 <br> 
 <br> Combat is another thing I love in WoW.  I am a druid so I am always busy going in and out of forms, nuking, healing, rooting, buffing, etc.  It keeps me busy and I like that.  With that said though I'm not sure if I could play a class that is always melee or always magic, I will have to try it now after being spoiled on the druid.
 <br> 
 <br> The quests are the normal package boy, kill quest, collect, whatever, but the bonus at the end and usually a good item or money make them worth doing.  I've yet to be seriously out of money or struggling in this game and I like that too.  I hated in other games leveling up and then farming for 10 hours to get that new piece of chest armor.
 <br> 
 <br> There are a few bugs I have run into playing WoW but nothing serious or game stopping, the worst ones require me to just logout and back in when I get stuck manipulating with an herb on the ground.

 <br> 
 <br> I think EQ2 might be a good game for the crowd it's targeting (a very small crowd compared to WoW's audience) but here's my main problems with EQ2.
 <br> 
 <br> 1) Bland environments. Everything looks like it's made out of grainy stone. Swords, armor, trees, dirt, etc. all look like they're made out of stone. The art in EQ2 is terrible imo and it makes the game look very ugly in my eyes. Bland environments, bland colors and a lifeless world deters me from playing the game the most.
 <br> 
 <br> 2) The Grind. By level 20, you're pretty muched forced to gouping. I HATE games that force you to do things (EQ2 forces grouping, PvE, lame quests, etc.). Atleast with WoW, you can choose which quests you want to do, to PvP or PvE, solo or group, etc. I also like WoW faced-paced gameplay compared to EQ2's gameplay which is pretty slow.
 <br> 
 <br> 3) Economy. WTF where the SOE devs thinking? In order to sell things, you have to set up shop in your own house while remaining logged in. This is by far the worst economic setup in any MMORPG I've ever played. It pretty much forces you to get a second account so that you can play while selling at the same time.
 <br> 
 <br> 4) Crafting. I don't really much like crafting in most games mainly due to the tedium and borringness but EQ2's crafting takes the cake as the worst. Almost all crafting items are worthless by the time you can make them and making them takes forever. Also the crafting items are useless compared to the loot you can just find in the game.
 <br> 
 <br> 5) Restrictiveness. EQ2 basically restricts you to just 2 starting areas: Evil or Good. This means that once you level your main up to a certain point and want to make an alt, you'll pretty much have to do the same exact thing for that alt as you did with your main. And to make matters worse, you're only allowed to have up to 4 characters per account! That means you'll never be able to try out all the various subclasses unless you constantly delete your old ones or buy a second account.
 <br> 
 <br> SOE's greed is blatantly obvious in EQ2 and this pretty much deters most people from playing it.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW is the perfect MMORPG for me so I'm sticking with it!

I've played months worth of /played in WoW, and a couple hardcore weeks worth of EQ2 beta. I enjoyed both games and think they do above average jobs at what they set out to do. I prefer WoW' style of PvE though, find PvP/faction war an absolute must, and am heavily biased to the Warcraft setting.
 <br> 
 <br> <ul>&quot;November 4th 2004
 <br> With the launch of two new fantasy worlds upon us soon, I've been having to face with a decision I would of prefered not to make. I have to choose between World of Warcraft and EverQuest II. I would of liked to play both games extensively, and would of loved to seen one release half a year, or even more, sooner, as the genre has been pretty dull the last couple years. But as the genre expands it's a decision that will most likely start to happen more often. 
 <br> 
 <br> I was recently asked which game I was going to play, as this person was torn by the decision as well. My choice generally always has and still is World of Warcraft, but I've been torn at times, even recently. Combining the lull WoW beta has been in the last few weeks waiting for the new patch, disapointing and uncertain news in regards to how a beta wipe is going to be handled, and a real impressive character stat site for EQ2 and their combat combo system... and I indeed felt torn. It didn't last though, soon as I see a shed of Warcraft light I'm reminded about why I love Warcraft. I still may play EverQuest II for the two weeks before World of Warcraft releases, it'll depend on how important I deem the new features in regards to post-beta and how they decide to handle the beta wipe (or lack thereof). But ultimately Kyan will only live in one fantasy world and that will be Azeroth. 
 <br> 
 <br> It won't be decided by the design of gameplay features, but the design of the game world itself: the design of the landscape, the current events of the day, who lives in it, what they look like, what they do, what they're capable of, what their roles are, and basically everything else that defines each world. And with that being considered, the following are the 3 main reasons I've chosen World of Warcraft as my home. 
 <br> 
 <br> 1) Faction Conflict - Norrath is too tame right now. You have two cities at odds and a &quot;cold war&quot; in the lore books but in terms of day to day events and player gameplay, there's no atmosphere of conflict, and plenty of easy going interaction. Freeport also originally appealed to me as it reminds me a lot of what I imagine a more urban Sanction, of the Dragon Highlords in the Dragonlance novels, would of been liked. Once into the details though, while much of the evil in the city is well done, the factions inside of it feel too poor, not epic, and too worried about bickering over scraps and little things. 
 <br> 
 <br> Azeroth on the other hand is on the brink of WoW based on lore, and based on gameplay, they're already at full out war. Even if there was no PvP, there would be army based PvM where you lead raids against armies or something. It's Warcraft, after all. If EQ2 is where adventure comes to life, WoW is where adventure and war come to life. Which leads to my next point. 
 <br> 
 <br> 2) It's the Warcraft world - I simply like the design more. I like the factions more. I like their beliefs and traditions, their history and lore more. I like how the races and species of the world look more (many EQ races, especially the gnolls and goblinkin, are so uninspired and boring). Not only that, I've loved the world of Azeroth since 1997, maybe even very late 1996, I can't remember when I first played the WC2 demo. 
 <br> 
 <br> 3) Class design and roles - In EQ2, Fighters are tanks, pure in simple. You got tanks, you got damager dealers, you got healers. I find the Warcraft fighter far, far more appealing than the EverQuest fighters. In general the classes in WoW are more verstatile, more capable. But specifically the fighters, yer not just a meat shield in WoW, you can be effective as other roles and yet it's still balanced well. I love fighters as I love the persona of being a warrior decked out wicked armor and cutting a bloody swath through the enemy or being the calm and honorable blade master. Being a taunt spamming meat shield who's only real purpose is to get hit around crushes that image. 
 <br> 
 <br> That's what it comes down to mainly - Simple Design. You could switch the leveling speed, solo ability, etc around, and they wouldn't really impact my decision. I can enjoy two games of contrasting pace. I can enjoy level &amp; progression based games like EQ or live-a-life socio-economic games like UO or early SWG. If a game is well done, polished, and the goals the game pursues are met -- it comes down to the design of the game world. This matters to me a lot more than most people, I'm reminded of this constantly with console RPGs and dealing with Japanese plots or casts I can't stand, even though they're superb games. 
 <br> 
 <br> When I envision my character and the world he lives in, what his role and capabilities in the world will be, and how I expect the world to grow around my character and others -- I find the character that I'll be in WoW to be far more appealing than the one I'd be in EQ2. And that truely is what it's come down to. 
 <br> 
 <br> That's all I can recomend to any gamer of this genre in the upcoming days and weeks. If you can't make your decision based on the gameplay both games offer, look to who you want to be in Azeroth and Norrath, what you want to be percieved as, what you want to accomplish and how you want your story to be developed. That's what it's all about in the end, so it's only good fortune that such is what ultimately chooses the fate of our fantasies.&quot;</ul>

 <br> 
 <br> It's straightforward and intuitive, but still quite complex.  
 <br> 
 <br> You can do more with your character via Talents than you can do with EQ2.  And you can unlearn your talents, if you don't like the aspect you've picked.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW graphics are really wonderful.  I have not been impressed by screenies from EQ2.

 <br> 
 <br> I'll be playing both, simply to say that playing a single game will just burn me out on it, so instead of playing 1 game in a hardcore fashion I play 2 casually.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW has PvP, and most importantly it has a large group of people that I've been playing games with for years. The PvP in this game, although dry and empty and meaningless and simplistic, still adds a certain degree of unpredictability to the game, and keeps things interesting. The graphics and animations are poor and some of the larger cities more resemble a patchwork quilt than anything else. The simplicity goes a bit far, the customization for your character in both creation and their evolution is just about the worst any MMO has to offer at the moment.
 <br> 
 <br> On the positive note it is soloable, to some degree, almost too soloable and in some ways this isn't entirely a good thing. There's no zoning, which has never been too huge an issue for me but it is somewhat nice to be able to run from point A to B without hitting loading bars. Low downtime keeps things moving, unlike DAoC and it's near 5 minute downtimes between fights if you couldn't find a healer, it's nice to not have to be 100% reliant on a group or specific class.
 <br> 
 <br> Now, as for EQ2, it has its flaws. Crafting, although a nice system, is somewhat too involved and becomes too dependent on other crafter classes to make it valuable. The graphics, although breathtaking, can really bring even a great system to it's knee's. Zoning, for some, is really bothersome although it only takes me 7 to 10 seconds to load a new zone, and my computer is hardly top of the line. Grouping can be a problem, to really hunt effectively it's best to group, but this isn't always a bad thing, and for all the people who bring this up as a huge detractor you can level up solo on quests easily as that's how I've done it.
 <br> 
 <br> For the positives EQ2 is far more immersive, in both the game world, the NPC's, weather, graphics, character appearance and customization and even their evolution over time. EQ2 has far more interesting quests than WoW's very simplified quests, ones that can be obtained in a variety of unique ways outside of just talking to an NPC with an annoying glowing punctuation over their head. The world just seems so much more grand, so much more diverse, the cities have buildings that just dwarf WoW's architecture in both size and appearance, they really do feel like a capital city. The combat in EQ2 is much better too, much more fluid and beautiful animation, 10x the variety of functional spells and combat styles. A lack of griefing, let's face it, WoW is a griefers paradise and I don't pay $15 a month so some kid can do his best to try to ruin my gameplay.
 <br> 
 <br> Personally, I'd say EQ2 is the better game, but they both have their niches. WoW is years behind everything else, especially compared to the next generation of games around the bend. I have no doubt WoW will prosper for a long time, because of the name, which is sad as in both RP and PvP there are much better games already out or on their way.

 <br> 
 <br> For who you?  I gained two levels last night in three hours of playing EQ II.  I don't find the leveling all that much different from any game I have played.  Well, I must say that a little over a year ago the level grind from 40 to 50 in DAoC was pure hell.  EQ II leveling is paced about right.  As is the leveling pace for WoW.

But lately I've been thinking about switching to WoW.
 <br> 
 <br> I was playing last night and it took me an hour to find a group. And at my level, being a healer, it's not easy to solo, nor is it worth my time. So I get on today, having to be at work in just under 3 hours, and I realize, I don't have enough time to get anything done. 
 <br> 
 <br> Supposedly they're adding some serious solo content in the near future so I want to hold out, as eq2 does a lot of things I REALLY like, the graphics are amazing to me, having voice acting was cool, I like the instancing as I was easily able to traverse the noob zones and do quests on launch day, etc.
 <br> 
 <br> But I just have this urge to play WoW also.

What game did you play, they're similar in names alone and little else.

Not that I expect anyone to have an objective viewpoint on these boards, especially not the most sheeplike fanbase in MMO's to date.

Sometimes getting to camp spot takes another 5-10. Then if the group was just formed about another 10 to get in a grove and xp flowing. I spent one hour getting group the other day. Some idiot went wrong way and got lost he came back with a train. We all died boom 20% xp debt and then group disbanded. Lame I want fun right away or at least be able to solo as good as grouping.
 <br> 
 <br> I had a level 25 guardian, 20 Necro, and level 12 Rogue.
 <br> 
 <br> I had high hopes for EQ2 it looked great and I thought some things were really cool. I am very disappointed with the game, nothing new here at all. The gameplay is weak though, quests are still get that or go there. Combat is fun but gets stale after a while. The graphics are great and sound good as well. This game I got two and a half weeks out of and had some good times.
 <br> 
 <br> The Good
 <br> In a great friendly guild and love be in-game with them. However all that can't make me want to play a game which is really fun only 10-25% of the time. Community was good too me people helped me that might different from someone else though. Combat was solid lots of skills but for me a warrior most feel the same.
 <br> 
 <br> The Bad
 <br> Combat Wheel is a little weak, in an pick-up group it doesn't work well. I can pull one of sometimes for a little damage. If I was in same group every day and we got it down it would be good. I tried using a macro to tell people I can casting HO and give a few seconds for me to get it and use skill to start it. A lot of people don't get how to use them. I'd like it if a skill that doesn't work when you cast it and someone uses a wrong skill right after it is casted doesn't stop it. I think it would be better if 50% of the time it happens. Questing looks nice on outside but gets old after a week or two. Using NPC look up for quests really annoys me a lot of the time it doesn't work. Ask one guard and he doesn't know and ask one next to him and he knows. One time asked guard right next to npc to see what would happen. Asked where npc was next to the guard he didn't know. Groups are sometimes hard to get and if easy turns out badly a lot. Now at level 21 sometimes take me 30-60 mins to find one then maybe 30-60 more getting warmed up and get xp rolling. Can get some good xp with a good group. Bad ones there are a lot of them. Solo at my level takes double or triple the time as a good group.
 <br> 
 <br> Value
 <br> So it lasted me two and a half weeks and wasn't horrible. The graphics and sound only go so far with boring gameplay. Grouping can be harsh with shared group debt. Everything gets old and I don't feel immersed.
 <br> 
 <br> Last Comments
 <br> Nothing new to this game at all, same as EQ except better graphics and sound. Yes things are better combat, quest, and everything. Guess what most MMOs have improved so that doesn't matter. All flash, no substance sums it up.

Fundamentally I disagree with too many of the design decisions in EQ2 to play it. I had preordered it, and in a moment of weakness (or insanity) I loaded up the game rather than returning it as I had planned. What I saw wasn't enough to change my mind, so I cancelled the account. No, I didn't play to 20, 30 or even 10.. I just knew the game wasn't for me.
 <br> 
 <br> How could I be so sure? Well, here's my list (not in any particular order):
 <br> 1) Four characters per account - I love alts, so this was a major disappointment.
 <br> 2) Group death penalty - Even on IoR I had people quit a group after a death. Heck, I had someone not only quit the group, but immediately log so they wouldn't have to help me get my shard back (after I had followed them for help on a quest).
 <br> 3) One starting zone, followed by two cities - Limited replayability. I plan on having at least 1 character in each starting area, and of each race, in WoW.
 <br> 4) No buffing outside your group - I *love* to drive-by buff. Heck, I even did it in CoH. I understand they wanted to prevent power-levelling, but I think they went too far.
 <br> 5) Graphics - The ultra-realistic style and drab color scheme doesn't suit me. Plus I think the animations are really poorly done. I play in 3rd person out of necessity, and the first time I saw my character run, I knew I was in trouble. I like the WoW style better - to be honest it reminds me of EQLive, especially the Planes of Power expansion (last one I played). I was never able to tweak my settings to get good results. Plus the slideshow effect of lag, and the blurriness of distant objects made me motion sick.
 <br> 6) Character models - Probably my biggest disappointment. The iksar and kerran look pretty nice, but the others..
 <br> 7) Zoning - No thanks, I'll take a seamless world. I know you don't zone as much in the later levels, but geez, I was sick of it shortly after arriving in the city.
 <br> 
 <br> That's what comes to mind right off. Frankly between the character creation disk, learning more about game mechanics and the first WoW stress test I knew I wouldn't be playing EQ2 long term. I loaded it up thinking I'd play it until WoW went live, but I had no desire to play it - I went back to CoH instead.
 <br> 
 <br> Different strokes for different folks as they say - Just no EQ2 for me. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050130105414im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">
