				Hello folks! The Topic of the Week is a topic or question I'll post on the boards every week for people to discuss. Then at the end of each week, the best responses will be chosen and posted on WoW Vault. In addition, the top response will get a choice of VIP for a week or a permanent title of his or her choice!

 <br> 
 <br> MMORPGs are extensive games with thousands of players.   WoW is only in Beta stages and the support network is being set up.  Webistes, in game service, etc.   What are things you would like to see as far as communicating with Blizzard when you have a problem in game?  Post ideas or thoughts on ways to make company to player interaction more effective.

				I havent really had to use customer service yet but I dont have high hopes for it being better then any other games support.  I always get excited when a new game comes out, hoping they learned their lesson and put a lot of importance on CS.  Hasnt happened yet.

				My biggest beef is GM's that have no power to correct a relatively minor issue.  
 <br> 
 <br> Example:
 <br> 
 <br> I die beacause of a known game bug there was no way to avoid.  In DAOC the GM would pick his nose, say ther was nothing he could do but that it was a known issue and move on.  
 <br> 
 <br> In EQ at least they would give you a free 100% rez so you were not put out due to their screw up.  Thats if the GM came in time, thats a whole other thing EQ service times suck.
 <br> 
 <br> ****
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> One feature I did like about DAOC's support was their secret word function on the account.  It acted like a master password that no matter what happened you could always get your account back if you knew the word.  
 <br> 
 <br> This also facilitated account trading because once a buyer knew the secret word and changed it at Mythic they knew that the account was safe.  This also helped when people accounts go stolen due to forced password hacking or stolen due to giving it out to a so called friend that later decides to change it and try and keep the account.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> ****
 <br> 
 <br> Regardless of those items I expect the company to maintain some form of regular telephone business hours to handle billing disputes and Tech support issues that pop up.  I also expect that they have a robust webpage for all pertinent game information.  Similar to what DAOC did, I think they have one of the better web sites in the MMOG community.  Lots of uesful information there and its kept relatively updated.

 <br> 
 <br> To be honest what made me think of this is a recent encounter I had with Mythic.  I'm still waiting on an answer to my dispute email.  I also don't think that waiting hours on an /appeal is a fun thing.  If it takes that long to take care of a problem then the company needs to hire more CSRs.  
 <br> 
 <br> Having limited experience with Blizzard I am not familiar with their in game support system.  I understand there is a mail system that has been utilized in game.  
 <br> 
 <br> <li>How effective is it? </li><li> Do your issues get taken care of? </li><li> Does good service make a difference in your over all impression of the game and/or the company? </li> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> And yes!  DAoC has a secret word!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040918041137im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">    Not sure I even remember mine....

				CSR's seem to be the best method. The only problems I have had (at least in DAOC) is the VERY limited power they have resolving bugs, time to respond (6+ hours often), and what they are willing to take appeals for. It seems the main job of Mythic CSR's is to be name police. This should be handled at character creation, not after 30+ levels.

				Well, I've played EQ more than anything else, so what I'm most interested in as far as CS goes is the areas in which EQ lacks. 
 <br> 
 <br> First, I want WoW to have enough CSR's that you can get a petition answered within an hour. The single biggest complaint I have with EQ CS is that it often takes DAYS to even get to talk to a real SOE-employed GM. Sure, you could usually get a guide response within an hour or two, but they couldn't DO anything most of the time, besides tell you that they are &quot;bumping it up to a GM&quot;. I swear, I think SOE employs perhaps 20 customer service reps to handle around 450 THOUSAND customers. 
 <br> 
 <br> Second, there needs to be a way to contact CS OUTSIDE the game. Sometimes, your problem is that you simply can't log on...if that happens then how in the heck are you supposed to submit a petition? That happened a lot in EQ as well. There was this one bug, such that when you went linkdead, every so often, the server would continue to think your character was still in the game, so you couldn't log back in. It was VERY annoying, and when it happened to you, if you didn't have a second account to login and submit a petition with, you often had to wait for a server reset to get to play again.

				I played DAoC for two years, and just now learned there was a secret word lol.  I hope the person that is using my account knows what it is , ehehehe, I sure as heck don't.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> EDIT:  
 <br> 
 <br> On customer service outside of the game, definitely important to have a competent tech support that is readily available.  Can't stress that enough.  
 <br> 
 <br> Oddly enough, during the short time that I was attempting to play Horizons, I actually went to the SWG tech support forum for help, and amazingly was able to recieve fairly immediate aid from one of their people.  (SWG because my wife was still playing it at the time).  Even though I had quit SWG many moons ago, I gave them &quot;mad props&quot; for being able to help me out regardless.

				Customer Service for CoH was pretty good when I played it.  I can remember having a mob stcuk in a wall (which we couldn't kill) and we needed to kill it to finish a mission.  It took about 10 minutes for the CSR to respond.  During that time the CSR made sure I was ready for him to unstick the mob...which I thought was damn cool of him....considering he could have just unstuck it and moved on to address the rest of the queue.

				I had some horrendous experiences with support in CoH.
 <br> At least one of the GMs ingame was abusive. The tech support were rude and would routinely ignore the information and questions you gave them to repeat the same question you had already answered over and over. There was also tinkering with the timer to make the support ticket close in the middle of you trying to get help. Weeee!
 <br> 
 <br> I want more preventative service and reps who take enough time with you to know what you said to them and have the courtesy to be friendly and honest in their reply.

				as long as customer support people are not really rude or refuse to help you because other people have appealed it, i am happy. I have had some back times with CS people in daoc, 90% of the time that i appeal something like a bug,  they delete the appeal instantly. When they do answer some of the people are really rude and one time when i sent in an appeal about somebody exploiting, i got an answer saying, &quot;that's not my problem&quot; not very good customer support  imo <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040918041137im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/19.gif" border="0" alt="plain" hspace="0" vspace="0">

				Agree with Ave. I had a query outstanding with CS for Lineage 2 for two months.  When I finally said &quot;enough I'm closing my account and will write to the BBB about your non existant CS&quot; the response was &quot;oh wait, sorry we are busy we will deal with it!&quot;  Followed by &quot;oh someone was breaking the rules in game and we took 2 months to look at it? Oh well thanks for playing Lineage 2!!&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> CoH CS was much better (NCsoft Cali need to take a leaf out of NCSoft Austin's CS team book).  Not only were the response times faster but the CS staff were knowledgeable about the game and had a sense of fun.
 <br> 
 <br> I'd like to see CS/GM's that know and more importantly actually play the game.  The most important part to me is someone during a problem that knows what they are talking about and isn't just reading from a script;  &quot;There are no reported bugs with this, can you tell me exactly what you did to reach this point?&quot; rather than the style of &quot;you suck at this game, have a nice day, thanks for playing our game!&quot;

				automating anything not essential is important 
 <br> 
 <br> but at the end of the day i expect to be able to speak with an in game rep for matters where one is required 
 <br> 
 <br> an extensive technical and in game knowledge base is also very important
 <br> 
 <br> and no deleting /appeals (or whatever system blizzard use) without a message to the person appealling with a reason as to WHY it has been deleted
 <br> 
 <br> all it has to be is an automated &quot;delete appeal&quot; response with a box to be filled in by a game rep - it doesnt need to take up a lot of time and resources to do either - just keeps people happy
 <br> 
 <br> an in game player advisory service is also a good idea like daoc for help with class speccing and where to find mobs and quests etc

				<span style="font-weight:bold;">I'd like to see CS/GM's that know and more importantly actually play the game. </span>
 <br> 
 <br> Was thining about that.  Kind of like taking your work home with you.   Would you get sick of dealing with it all day and not want to play the game at all?   But yes, I think they can take care of things better if they're knowledgable about game mechanics and have played.  Having a working knowledge of how the game goes would just assist CS in their jobs. 
 <br> 
 <br> I was in a customer service postition at one time.  Six months of extension training, I get out on teh floor and do it real time and funny thing, half the stuff in training I never encountered and I dealt with plenty of things that were never covered.  We had &quot;trainers&quot;  who had never been on the floor, so they had no practical application experience.

				CS is a very tough issue.  I don't know if the hype is true but I know that support costs.  Verant (pre-SOE) told us that 1 hour CS response time is insanely expensive.  I don't know what that means but I'm sure it has a significant cost.  The question I suppose is;  Can the customer or the vendor afford not to have speedy and efficient support?  I don't think so.  
 <br> 
 <br> I've worked in a support industry for almost 2 decades now and I can tell you that human nature is still human nature.  People are going to demand speedy resolution to issues.  It doesn't matter how unreasonable that might be.  Something I learned early on is that if you have a customer service perception problem then you have a customer service problem.  Period.  It doesn't have to be reasonable, that's just the way it is.  Also, customers are going to abuse customer service policy.  Period.  That's just the way it is.  Trying to deny these issues is like trying to argue with gravity.
 <br> 
 <br> In DAoC I had good experiences with support.  They answered fairly quickly (within an hour) and usually had ways of verifying my issue and resolutions were almost immediate.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ was a different story completely.  Guides were a good idea at first and they were very helpful but they were abused and eventually fell out of favor.  When I quit you couldn't get the simplest answer from a guide.  Getting help from an actual CS rep was far worse.  If you could get them to answer you at all, they always gave you the same answer... sorry I cannot help.  They had no means to verify your problem.  By the time they responded (2 weeks was the max I experienced) the trail was cold and there was nothing they could do.  Or so they said.  I found out that perserverance and tenacity worked wonders but it sometimes took more than a month.
 <br> 
 <br> Support is very important to me.  I think my ultimate reason for quitting EQ was lack of support.  I am one of the few that is actually willing to pay extra for speedy and efficient support.  Your average person is not.  Oh and that doesn't mean that they don't expect it anyway.  You techy types know what I'm talking about.  Your friend/mother/grandfather/neighbor asks your opinion on what to buy from Dell or Gateway and despite your advice, they save $200 and skimp on technical support.  Sooner or later the excrement hits the fan and they are screaming for help that is not avaiable because they didn't pay for it and they are mad as heck and blaming everyone but themselves.
 <br> 
 <br> Bottom line:  I think fast efficient support should be mandatory and built into the general costs.  10 to 20 minute responses should be the goal and anything over an hour should be unacceptable.  At the very least, (and I think this IS the very least) the vendor should offer some type of premium support for those of us who are smart enough to pay for it.  But it better not be insanely priced.
 <br> 
 <br> Yes the vendor is between a rock and hardplace.  Such is reality.  Welcome to the market.
