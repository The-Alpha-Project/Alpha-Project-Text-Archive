				Every game since the Eq/AC1 Era was supposidly the end all be all MMO game(DaoC, AC2, SWG, Horizons, etc.).
 <br> 
 <br> Problem is, people have different tastes and it is difficult for 1 game to fulfill so many *different* peoples vision of an end all be all MMO.
 <br> 
 <br> The other problem is that almost all of these post AC/EQ games have been released far too early, and have been a bug filled mess.
 <br> 
 <br> To simplify what I am *personally* looking for, I thought about what I disliked from previous MMO releases and made a little list.
 <br> 
 <br> Here is what I am looking for:
 <br> 
 <br> 1)  A bugless launch (i.e. A Polished game); no crashes.
 <br> 
 <br> 2)  A content filled game giving me options from the moment I log in as to what I wish to do with the time I have.
 <br> 
 <br> 3)  Plenty of quests for all levels (Im sick of camping).
 <br> 
 <br> 4)  NO LAG....server side or client side.  (as to the client side, if the Recommended Specs are on the box, then the recommended specs should play the game without incident)  
 <br> 
 <br> 5)  No Forced Grouping.  I want to be able to *play* during the time I have (...FFXI...)
 <br> 
 <br> 6)  A thriving economy.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> If the above can be done from day 1 of release, then I have found a game I can call home for years to come.
 <br> 
 <br> I must hand it to Blizzard though.  With no NDA, there shouldnt be any surprises as to how stable the game is, or what to expect.  All the others...well, you had to buy to find out.

				I think what they do after release will be just as important as the quality of the game at release.  ie, storyline, events, high-level content.  So it's hard to say whether a game is &quot;the One&quot; until a few months into it.

				This game isn't going to be any game killer or any of that jazz.  I doubt its even going to be the next big thing in the mmorpg genre.  WoW just isn't mainstream enough to be the number one game.  
 <br> 
 <br> But it will be successful, and it will also do an excellent job of what I feel its primary purpose is:  to allow players and especially warcraft fans to experience the lands of Azeroth from a &quot;birds eye&quot; view.  So far, from what I've seen in beta, it does a pretty good job of the later <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040822175813im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> .

				When any hyped mmorpg comes out they all mmorpgs have a mass exodus of players who rush to try the new shiny mmorpg that just came out.
 <br> 
 <br> Thing is that most mmorpgs that have come out of late havent been all that great. And alot of the players rushed back to there old mmorpg after there first month was up.
 <br> 
 <br> Wow so far is a great mmorg, it's not mind blowing but it is fun. It will no doubt take alot of players from there old mmorpg. I dont see anyone closing there doors because wow comes out unless they were already suffering.
 <br> 
 <br> But if your burnt out on your current mmorpg then maybe wows for you.

				Outside of lore, design and some races, WOW has nothing to do with the WC series.  If all of us &quot;peons&quot; together can take up roles and build bases and battle against the opposition, then we have some Warcraft.  Otherwise, its just another level treadmill...sorry to say.  Until then, its a waiting game to see if Blizzard has the balls to do it right!

				<i>Regardless of what new MMORPG comes out, people will pine for their first that they popped their virtual cherry on.</i>
 <br> 
 <br> That is soooooooo true.....
 <br> 
 <br> for 99% of the mmorpg population.  Seriously, I agree with you, and had you said this two monthes ago, I'd agree with you 100%.  But there is a small portion of us that will eventually find something that makes us replace our first love.  I thought that was impossible until I actually got into WoW, and then I was like &quot;Everwho?&quot;  (everquest was my first, and I've always been looking for something like it, but better, ehehe.  Still has a special place in my heart though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040822175813im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0"> ).   Now, years from now, when WoW has come and gone, I have the feeling I will spend another 5 or so years looking for the game that will replace WoW in that respect.  Comes and goes I guess.
 <br> 
 <br> I wish everyone luck in finding &quot;the game&quot; that truly suits you!

				&quot; Every game since the Eq/AC1 Era was supposidly the end all be all MMO game(DaoC, AC2, SWG, Horizons, etc.). &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> who ever thought that horizons\swg\and ac2 were goign to be messiahs of the mmorpg world must be on crack. Horizons is just terrible, so is ac2, but i could see how some people think that swg would take all other, but its mainly made up of hard core stars wars fans(i think). Daoc couldnt kill ac and eq cause they were are all fairly new at the time.
 <br> 
 <br> WoW does have the chance to put the nail into the coffin for many games. From reading message boards, a lot of ac1 and daoc players are goign to be playing WoW. I suspect that WoW will prolly take out a HUGE chunk of daoc's playerbase, but im not sure if they will stay in WoW or not, many tend to try new games but always come back to daoc. WoW will definately take out horizons and might make ac2 bottom out also, both games have been on a rapid decline release.

				I'm definitely having fun.  I really like the fact that I've been able to go solo for everything I've experienced so far and that XP process is fairly fast paced. The two recent classes I've played (shaman/warlock) just mow down the enemies 2-3 at a time with relative ease and little -&gt; no downtime.  This makes for more excitement and offers rewards to those of us that can only play 1-2 hours at a time and don't want to spend most of it trying to find a group.
 <br> 
 <br> This game has me sold so far but I'd like to see how they develop PvP.  PvP is the endgame for me... something to strive towards.  If it sucks, I will likely not play WoW no matter how good the PvE is.  I'm just not a PvE type of player.

				I expect that many of the existing MMORPG's will take a major hit from both EQ2 and WoW when they come out. But neither will kill anything. There will always be the loyal fans that refuse to abandon the characters that they have spent months/years developing and will remain regardless. Then there are those wacko's that will play multiple MMORPG's at the same time. Personally, I think that people that do this have way to much money on their hands.

 <br> Well no.... That was not the problem. The problem was that all those games that came after sucked majorly. DAOC less so than the other three you mention. 
 <br> 
 <br> WoW on the other hand, not been in NDA beta, the public knows that it doesn't suck.

				Some games will suffer a lot more than others.
 <br> 
 <br> SWG and AO will probably not suffer a super amount.  Games are two different to be a super draw.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ1/AC1/AC2/DAOC will likely feel the pain.  Even if not enough to kill them outright, it will hurt them no question.
 <br> 
 <br> CoH/L2 will likely be the biggest loosers percentage wise in north america.
 <br> 
 <br> Both games have issues that lend them to being just &quot;Time Killers till Eq2/wow&quot; comes out kind of games.
 <br> 
 <br> Any other gaems not mentioned above has such a small subscriber base that they really don't warrent the mention.
