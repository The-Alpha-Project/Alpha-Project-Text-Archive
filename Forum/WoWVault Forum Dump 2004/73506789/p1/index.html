				Just checked out the WoW Hunter page and they seem to be getting a lot of stuff... I don't want to go into too much detail about it just bring up a few issues I found..
 <br> 
 <br> Firstly I hope the hunter pets have to be significantly lower in level than the hunter, obviously if a level 40 hunter has a level 40 pet, immediately he is overpowered, I would suggest something like max pet level being 75% of the Hunters level.
 <br> 
 <br> Hunters wearing Mail? pffft... sneaking through the forest to get that new pet.. *clink clunk* :P that chainmail armor will scare most animals away or alert them to your presence, Hunters are meant to be a ranged class using pets to tank, they do not need anything stronger than leather armor.. nor does it make sense from a roleplay perspective.
 <br> 
 <br> And Traps? for the hunter? hmm sure hunters use traps but maybe they should only work on animals.. Rogues are a class I think is suitable for making traps and rogues should get traps that target humanoid types.
 <br> 
 <br> Lastly, Feign death... again this seems like a skill the Rogue class should get, I know they have vanish but come on how can feign death be a hunter skill.. they should get something like &quot;mask scent&quot; which removes their scent and they can remain still and fool the animal into de-agroing.  It shouldnt be called feign death cause if they feign death then the animal might just eat them, and for something like this to work against humanoids would require the rogues skill-line of Subtlety.
 <br> 
 <br> Anyway lemme know what you think.

				I think that WoW is all about packing every class with as much utility and versatility as will fit. The hunter is no exception to this.
 <br> 
 <br> There is no hinderance to the hunter's actual or immersion/roleplay based abilities because of mail armor. They dont sneak. They hunt, not hide. For this kind of woodsman it isnt about trying to go undetected, its about finding that comfortable balance that lets them actually interact with nature.(as a predator :P )
 <br> NPC hunter already in the game have pets around 75-85% of their level. I cant say for sure what it is, but it is noticably below their own level.
 <br> Rogues have lots of toys already. They're about to get beefed up even more, plus talents. Rogues are more direct in how they deal with their targets. They are assassins. They use themselves and things to improve what they can do. The hunter has tools at his disposal to make use of places, things, and entities outside of himself.
 <br> Feign death isnt that attractive of a skill because it gives you the games very unwanted rez sickness. Its also more fitting for a hunter than a rogue. Accomplished outdoor experts know how to react to an animal attack from beasts such as bears and alligators so that the onslaught will cease. Many animals do not immediately their prey and the majority of fights you might find yourself in with animals wont revolve around if they can eat you. Using the same skills against sentients and humans isnt that much of a stretch, especially for a fantasy game.
 <br> 
 <br> I have to disagree with both your concept of the rogue and the hunter. It seems to me like you may have somewhat of a bias towards augmenting the rogue instead of judging the hunter on his own merit. If you are in beta I'd suggest waiting for the next patch. If you arent, I suggest waiting for the next patch and then looking into what the rogue class in WoW is.
 <br> 
 <br> Oh, you do know hunters use mana, right? They have some druidic aspects that lend themselves to the behavior we see implied by the hunter's list of skills.

				Plan on or are playing a Rogue ryto1? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040920060031im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> 
 <br> Hunters are looking to be the best class I've ever played in any online game ever. I'm sure they will have weaknesses to balance out the strengths. Probably more so than people might think.
 <br> 
 <br> I will agree on the Hunters shouldn't be able to wear mail. It seems Hunters should be relying on pets to keep the baddies off them while using range weapons. Even if I'm stuck in a tolkien-esque frame of mind, it just seems wrong that Hunters have anything stronger than leather.

				lol i was afraid people would think im trying to favor the rogue, im not, its just apparent that the hunter is getting a few skills that are rogue-type skills.
 <br> 
 <br> Just don't want to see hunters become what necromancers were in everquests early days.

				I dont see feigning death or traps as particularly rogue oriented things, especially not the rogue you see in WoW. 
 <br> Sometimes we have our own ideas about what a class should be but the game's designers go another route <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040920060031im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/2.gif" border="0" alt="sad" hspace="0" vspace="0"> 
 <br> Not a bad thing over all, just not our ideal choice of roles. Me, I want a melee oriented light tank with a pet class. The hunter brushes with that idea, but I dont think I'll make it work as viably as my playstyles with other classes.
 <br> The ranged archer people should enjoy themselves though, and it'll be a fun class to be around and toy with.

 <br> wait.. no.. the above statement is a jest and i don't have an actual opinion of afghanistans current or prior politics, but there's also the fact that this is a discussion about the hunter class, of course Blizzard is going to do what they want to in the end.. obviously, and im not going to ask the Taliban or Osama to bomb them into capitulating either, but I will try and discuss it and point out the issues I and others might have.. please don't post if you aren't interested in making some real points other than &quot;let blizard do it, dont say anything&quot; or &quot;if you dont like the class then dont play it&quot; or &quot;hahaz n00b you made a speeling 3rr0r&quot;.

I'm not easily offended, but that was straight up ignorant and classless.  You sir, are a fecking idiot.

				If I was a hunter in WoW I'd sure want chain.  RL you shoot an animal, it dies or buggers off.  In WoW you shoot something and it comes for you.  There is also some precedence for a hunter in mail:  boar hunting.  Big nasty things with pointy bits.  You don't wanna hunt those in your PJs.
 <br> 
 <br> Traps also seem logical for the hunter.  
 <br> 
 <br> I dunno about feign death though.  That does seem kinda odd.

				Actually I think the decision to let hunters have mail at lvl 40 is a lot more about game mechanics than it is about any kind of roleplaying reality.
 <br> 
 <br> It's simple, with pallys and warriors getting plate at lvl 40, they needed other classes to replace them as users of mail past lvl 40, either that or they would have to remove all lvl 40+ mail, since noone would use it. 
 <br> So from that standpoint I think it makes perfect sence that it's shamans and hunters that get the ability to wear mail armor.

				Feign death / play dead / playing possum 
 <br> 
 <br> whatever you want to call it is a animal trait so it suits Hunters very well.  O'possums play dead, some snakes like the Hog-nosed snake play dead, ...  It's very much a nature thing -- not a Rogue thing.

				Testing will easily take care of the armor balance and pet level.  If history means anything, the pets will be well below the character level.  Otherwise, its controling 2 equal lvl characters at once...unfair.
 <br> 
 <br> The typical bitching will begin.  Those who don't get it, will want a a warrior combined with an archer combined with a pet and then complain when none of those single aspects are that great.  Since theres no archer class, the hunter becomes the archer.  The pet should become the melee power.   
 <br> 
 <br> As long as the Hunter's melee is reduced either due to armor or lack of powerful skills, they shold work out.  The problem comes with trying to appease the stupid masses who want a character too similar to something they're read in a book.  OH well.  Players are that stupid.  Let it begin=)

				Frankly, Blizzard seems to have a very distinct idea of how they want their game world to be...and it doesn't seem to fit with the &quot;stereotypical&quot; high fantasy setting that's been popular in RPGs for years now.  If you actually take a look at the classes and races...each and every one of them differs quite a bit from what you might expect.
 <br> 
 <br> I'm quite curious to see what a WoW Hunter plays like...  I'm not going to start telling Blizzard what needs to be fixed until I see what THEIR vision for the hunter is, and how it fits into the game world.

				Ok, setting aside Ryto1's confusion over whether or not Hunters will get stealth. I think he is overlooking one very important reason for giving hunters chain armor. PvP. I played a lot, and I mean a lot, of pet classes in DAoC. In PvP pet classes suck because everyone ignores the pet, knowing that if they kill the owner the pet is useless. This pretty much holds true for any MMORPGH that I've played with pet classes and PvP.
 <br> 
 <br> I don't know about what level the pet will be in relation to the owner. Personally, I hope that it will be be the same, but will deminished abilities. One of the main problems with pet classes in DAoC is that the pets are so level in comparision to players in PvP that they either can't hit or do damage at all and are thus not worth worrying about. I don't think that a Hunters pet should do as much damage as say a mage or a warrior, but they should be able to do significant damage to make people and even mobs to realize that ignoring them is a mistake.
 <br> 
 <br> I thought that I had heard awhile back that Blizzard was going to make is so that Hunters had to wait a fairly long amount of time to resummon their pets if they died. Can anyone confirm this or did I day dream on this one?
 <br> 
 <br> To wrap this up I'm going to say that it does look like Hunters are going to get quite a bit and not everything that I would have expected. But Blizzard seems determined to pack every class with tons of utility to keep us occupied and until they actually put the class into the game I'd hold any cries for nerf until we see how it plays out in relation to all the other classes out there.
 <br> 
 <br> I could argue that my vision of a Rogue is one of stealth, espionage, and theft not that of a massive damage assassin. But that would be my personal view on the subject and would generate a lot of outrage from all those players out there that want to play the murderous kill the enemy with a single blow from stealth class.

				i also noticed, it said on the page that you can have guns or bows, but it doesnt mention that you can train guns, but it does say you can train bows, i wanted to play an orc gun hunter, and now i'm questioning wether i'll be able too, or did they just miss putting in the guns(with training) part?

				I was looking at the hunter page and one thing did strike me, the info is very sketchy at best. First off it doesnt give any hard numbers of how much each thing is going to do. Look at the stings, it could be a really crappy health/mana dot and not really worth it. Also they have no real form of CC no stuns, roots, mezzes whatsoever. 
 <br> 
 <br> Another thing people fail to realize as well is that hunters are going to be the only class that has an expendible weapon as their primary way to attack. Everytime they attack they lose and arrow/bullet so they have to alway make sure they have a ton of them so its going to either cost the hunter lots of money or lots of tradeskill time to make them.

 <br> 
 <br> Actually one of the really nice things is that the majority of a range weapons DPS comes from the weapon itself.  I think the highest amount of arrow/bullet damage I've seen was around 6-8 damage on top of whatever the weapons DPS was to start with.  I'm sure it can get higher than that, but I don't think the ammo is going to make or break a character.  Like many of the things implemented, the range of stat/damage/armor is narrow enough at certain level ranges that one doesn't feel the need to buy the top of the line stuff unless they have the money to blow for that little extra kick.
