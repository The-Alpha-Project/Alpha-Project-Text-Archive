Realm abilities pretty much destroyed the dynamic of RvR, and made the game about PvP. The game became about ganking and not about defending your realm.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> It's interesting you say this because I feel the same way and this would actually be a better premise for why DAoC's went to hell.  That is, that stuff like RAs ruined RvR.
 <br> 
 <br> I think people would like to be rewarded for PvP participation but it's really not necessary.  Plenty of DAoC players enjoyed RvR before there were ever RPs or RAs - they did it for fun or realm pride.  In MMORPGs with lesser forms of PvP (IMO only) people still duke it out regularly without special PvP rewards.
 <br> 
 <br> If you have 10 special abilities you are going to destroy someone who has none.  It's obvious and it's obviously far less competitive.  There will be that rare case where some moron gains the 10 special abilities and is beaten by a highly skilled and resourceful person who doesn't have the specials - but that will be the rare exception.
 <br> 
 <br> I also think the realm ranking and stat system was a bad idea.  It took RvR and made it into an epeen contest.  You might like that type of PvP but I contend that it is not what RvR was originally presented as nor is it how RvR was at release or in the early days of RvR.  Almost everyone I know who likes RvR in DAoC liked it more before there were RAs, SCing, or any other perversions that made it far easier to unbalance.  Most people I know of that got fed up with DAoC did so because they were sick of the imbalance or overall state of RvR.  A lot of times they were also sick of the PvE grind - but most of them continued with DAoC in hopes of the RvR &quot;getting fixed&quot; and it never happened (for them at their time).
 <br> 
 <br> If all you want to do is run around and randomly kill random players there are many games with that type of gameplay - what set DAoC apart in it's early days was that it had purposeful PvP.  It was one of the selling points of DAoC, it was something that made DAoC somewhat unique, and they lost it over time.
 <br> 
 <br> A large part of my argument is that PvP in MMORPGs should be more than just random gankfests.  That's what FPS are for.  MMORPGs are deeper games with character development, storylines, and sophisticated social systems.  Why then should the PvP in these games degenerate into barbaric anarchistic kill-every-thing-that moves random killing sprees?  If the random killing is all you want there are many games that offer it - you should expect more from the deeper MMORPG genre.
 <br> 
 <br> Early RvR tied all the elements together nicely - you developed a character to fight for your realm (as the storyline put you in distinct realms in a perpetual state of war) and you formed guilds and alliances with the intent of being more organized to pursue meaningful, large-scale PvP goals.
 <br> 
 <br> I would agree that often sieges weren't very exciting - there were times where I defended or assaulted keeps for hours on end that have scarred me for life - but - IMO, instead of ruining RvR with RAs, SCing, and other perversions - turning it into a meaningless epeen flexing gankfest - AND adding tons of punishing and unnecessary PvE elements, that Mythic should've been focusing on improving RvR elements like siege to make the meaningful RvR more enjoyable.
 <br> 
 <br> Anyways - my point was not to discuss the golden age of DAoC, or reminisce of good times lost, or even to say &quot;daOc is teh suq.&quot;  My point was to illustrate how PvP in a MMORPG can be different, how it was done different and very well, how one of the best PvP systems for MMORPGs was ruined, and to point out that Blizzard has the chance to learn from Mythic's mistakes and take the idea and make it better.
 <br> 
 <br> A lot of people say that there is nothing innovative about WoW - it's just a &quot;best of&quot; that takes a lot of good ideas from previous games and does them better.  I think that's a fine concept and in almost every way I think it succeeds and leads to a very enjoyable product.
 <br> 
 <br> Because WoW is a &quot;best of&quot; type of game, it's impossible to avoid comparing it to the similar games in its genre - particularly when it borrows ideas directly from them.  IMO, nobody has ever done content or community like EQ - and obviously WoW is borrowing ideas from EQ (at least as far as content goes - community could be another rant).  IMO, nobody has done PvP in a MMORPG like DAoC's early RvR.  The auction house would appear to be borrowed from FFXI or wherever they got it from.  And so on.
 <br> 
 <br> To continue along the line of design thought that says take the best and make it better, I'd like to see WoW taking the excellent PvP idea that was early RvR in DAoC and embellish it to make it into an even better system.

 <br> 
 <br> No.  First off, it's not any super genius strategy.  It's a bunch of fotmers trying to get their kicks.  And it makes it impossible for anyone who just wants to have fun.  They're not any better than anyone else.  A bunch of monkeys could do the same thing.
 <br> 
 <br> Do you really want to knwo what bothers me so much about it?  It's not actually the game itself.  Its the kind of people that are involved.  Like I said earlier, I spent alot of time scouring their forums and for the most part, they are the scum of gaming.  They have no understanding or appreciation for the game itself.  They only use it as a means to make themself feel big.  Many of them posers who spent their life calling console rpgs gay while they sat around talkin about how tight grand theft auto or some other &quot;im cool because im a criminal&quot;, or &quot;thug life&quot; game is.  It's knowing that people that have no appreciation for the game are on top because they see it as nothing but a locker room.

 <br> 
 <br> If I want PvP without character advancement I will go play Counter-Strike.
 <br> 
 <br> There is virtually no draw to PvP without PvP rewards in an MMORPG.  It's not as exciting as a shooter or as strategic as an RTS.
 <br> 
 <br> Maybe in these so-called &quot;golden days&quot; of DAoC, people really did go out and PvP just for the fun of it.
 <br> 
 <br> How many of them?
 <br> 
 <br> How often?
 <br> 
 <br> 10 to 1 very few people went out and PvPed, and it was all much, much smaller scale than it is now.
 <br> 
 <br> I sincerely doubt DAoC was considered to be &quot;about&quot; PvP for most people until the RR system was added.
 <br> 
 <br> Since I wasn't there, I don't know.  You tell me.

You'd get exp bonuses for killing other factions and using your abilities (hacking etc), but the REAL rewards came from taking and defending bases.  I think where a single kill was worth like 30-100exp, a base was worth 10-15000 or so (If there were people defending it).  So in the beginning, before the massive zergs played basehopping, either side could fight FOR HOURS over a single disputed base and accomplish something for everyone involved.  (It was mad fun dropping out of a Galaxy onto the roof and storming the command center <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20041130232604im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">  - It's been a long while since I played Planetside, so I might be remembering the mechanics incorrectly)

 <br> That seems fair as long as the items are inline with what you could get from pve.

Yeah i know alot of casual players didnt like it because they werent able to keep up with the powergamers, but seriously a person that plays 7+ hours a day shouldnt have the same damage/defence ext. as person that plays 1-2 hours a day, it just wouldnt be practical. To some extent, i agree that mythic took it a little to extreme, but a person that plays 40+ hours a week for 6 months straight should have some type of advantage over the rest.

Simple-mindedness is for you animals who go through life having never thought of anything other than what's right in front of you because you're too afraid to think everything you know and love might mean less than crap.
 <br> 
 <br> Little tip.  To every ganker, gankers are fine.  To everyone else, you just ruin the game.  You turn the field from something that everyone can do for fun into a toilet where only bacteria like your kind can thrive because you're so fixated on trying to make sure everyone knows you are uber that you corrupt the entire system.  And not only that.  Your endless gank makes it impossible for any real pvp to take place.
 <br> 
 <br> I have never seen any &quot;good gankers&quot;, nor anything to lead me to believe otherwise.  If I had, I'd mention them, but I haven't, so I can't.
 <br> 
 <br> Bottom line is that real RvR was a seige that lasted for an hour or more, and could go either way, where things could make a difference, and open field battles where either side could win.  Not a bunch of twits runnign aroudn with teamspeak and radar pharming ppl all day.

 <br> 
 <br> You do realize that your statement is 'one man's opinion' right?  I don't think there will ever be &quot;real RVR&quot; or even PVP that you will enjoy.  
 <br> 
 <br> Zergs are a product of: 1. I'm tired of being owned so I'll join a school of fish. 2. I enjoy large scale combat.  
 <br> 
 <br> Gank squads are a product of any one of the following: 1. I am uber and can't stand grouping n00bs who sux in PVP.  2. My guild or group of friends and I know how to play our characters together well in PVP. 3. I hate solo PVP and Zergs don't require any talent to PVP.  
 <br> 
 <br> Solo PVP is a product of: 1. I hate Zergs. 2. I have no friends and hate people.  3. My class is considered 'despised' by most players so I have little choice but to join my fellow 'despised' characters in solo PVP. 4. I enjoy being self reliant and occasionally helping others by providing intel.
 <br> 
 <br> Ya I oversimplified a bit and it is my one-man&#8217;s-opinion.  The point is there are more options than joining a group of jerks that radar 4tehwin.  There will probably NEVER be PVP that makes you happy if you don&#8217;t like any of those options.  WOW is not going to fix your fundamental issues with PVP which seems to be the obnoxious trash talking few.  You WILL find Zergs in WOW.  You will find small successful &#8216;gank squads&#8217; in WOW and some may hurt your feelings by calling you bad names and doing the chicken dance on your corpse.  There WILL also be solo twinks that are freaking hard as hell to kill and you will swear they are cheating somehow because you can&#8217;t WTFPWN them as easily as everyone else.  Then you will bitch about it on VN and call for nerfs of the offending classes that whip your butt.  An the beat goes on&#8230;

Just to prove what an idiot you are, I will break your post down and destroy it piece by piece.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Drake_the_merc, you ARE a simple minded moron.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> No I'm not.  You are just pissed off because you can't stand someone slamming on your people you get a hard on for.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;FYI, I have never been in a gank squad, but I admire and respect those that successfully run one.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> FYI, you are respecting guttertrash.  What they do is no big mystery.  IT takes no special skills, and exceptional amount of talent.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;They are GOOD at the game--they have developed teamwork, strategy, and straight-out reactionary skill to the point where they can hand over the asses of zergs 10x their size.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Ok, please kill yourself now.  You're dead-weight.  Their &quot;developed teamwork&quot; is normal teamwork.  Their &quot;developed strategy&quot; is nothign special.  It's common sense.  Their &quot;reactionary skill&quot; is no more than anyone elses.  Skill doesn't make you able to kill a group 10x your size, and if you think so, you are retarded.  The only time this could happen is if a pbae group caught a raid off guard while they were bunched up, which I've seen happen.  That's dumb luck.  Skill ha snothign to do with it.  The other way it coudl happwn is if the big group was afk.  All of them.  If the small group is not pbae, thyey aren't going to beat a zerg unless they are cheating, which I have experienced in DF (solo savage killing 8 lvl 48+)
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;What the hell is wrong with that? I don't understand your problem with it. You hate them and think they are scum because they are GOOD AT THE GAME? That sounds an awful lot like JEALOUSY to me.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Are you purposely not paying attention just so in your mind, your retarded crap is justified?  I hate them because 1.  Of who they are.  And 2.  Because they ruin the playing field for everyone else.  Being good is making your class work.  Gank groups are fotmers who suck at their original class and abandon it.  It's not jealousy.  It's just the fact that unliek you, I don't drool at the thought of them dropping their pants.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;What would you rather them do? Play poorly on purpose? Break up their tight and well-oiled group to suit your pansy &quot;please don't gank me!&quot; whims?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I would rather them all go get drunk and have a massive wreck and kill eachother, so I could have fun and not have to put up with a bunch of fotm rp whores who care only about their rp count.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I can't wrap my mind around the fact that you hate people for running an 8-man full group effectively. You should look up to them as an example of the game played at its highest and most skilled level, not despise them.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> That's your problem.  You're trying to wrap your mind around the wrong thing because you've convinced yourself that gankers are, and that's that.  You say they are taking the game to its max, but in reality, they dont give a damn at the game at all.  They max a characte rin 2 days, which should be an accomplishemnt, but they go to such extremes that it kills it completely.  The only thing they are an example of is common guttertrash.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Unless you're just a jealous kid. And that's what it sounds like to me.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Now that was just stupid.  Is that all you monkeys can say?  &quot;You're a kid&quot;.  &quot;come back when you grow up.&quot;  &quot;stupid kid.&quot;  &quot;Looks like the kids are out of school.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> And jealousy is a stupid emotion.  There are only 2 true emotions.  Anger and hate.  These are the essence of humanity, and in the end, all the positives will degrade into these.
 <br> 
 <br> The truth is grim, and I've played for nearly 3 years, so don't give me this crap.  If you'd seen the things I've seen, and experienced what I've experienced, you'd agree, but you're just oblivious to the truth because you don't know any better.  They say ignorance is bliss, and you're the one I hear singing praises.
 <br> 
 <br> Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go for a little while.  But please continue to try and say gankers are teh l337z and that everyoen else is a n00b.

I'e gotten many a laugh from stealthing the forums of many a gank guild and watching the kinds of stuff they talk about, and their general attitude.
 <br> &gt;--
 <br> 
 <br> Seek help. Infiltrating forums and so much pent up bitterness arent you taking that game a bit too seriously?
 <br> 
 <br> Anyway I am not clear what people are talking about when they talk about game being good before RAs. No purge, no CC ressists, first mez wins game was incredibly unbalanced. Yes some RAs they added were pretty bad, but many things they added as RAs were needed for balance which was nowhere to be found before RAs. Top bard mezz would get you disabled for more then 1 minute...
 <br> 
 <br> Spelcrafting also added to the game alot, first was change in the unbalance of how resists worked. Remember when every mid had zero pierce resists and spearoes 2 shoted people? Was that fun? no It also made fights last longer=more fun.
 <br> 
 <br> Gank grps bring alot of fun to the game. My first encounter with them was on the receiving end. You know what? Yes I was disapointed we got wasted so bad. But we learned fast. It brought game to the next level. It made everyone who I played with play much smarter. Instead of whining we started playing better.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I think combination of both personal and realm based rewards is the best. WoW is not daoc, in its present form its lightyears ahead of the non-existant pvp balance daoc had at release. Blizzard is smart enough to put incremental rewards that will not destroy the pvp. On other had rewards for controlling battlegrounds and such are very nice to have when they put them in it will be fun to fight over those. One big thing they need to try and do is not limit battleground fights to fort+zerg standoffs. Make objectives more dynamic with less emphasis on fortified positions.

Just to prove what an idiot you are, I will break your post down and destroy it piece by piece.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;No I'm not. You are just pissed off because you can't stand someone slamming on your people you get a hard on for.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> The only thing I get a hard on for is my girlfriend (or possibly my pron collection).  However, I recognize skill when I see it, unlike you.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;FYI, you are respecting guttertrash. What they do is no big mystery. IT takes no special skills, and exceptional amount of talent.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Okay, why, since you're so intent on supposedly proving I'm an idiot?  Details.  Evidence.  Explanation.  You didn't give me any of those things.
 <br> 
 <br> Gank groups have to have excellent communication.  They have to juggle knowing where their fellow group members are at all times.  They have to find them and respond immediately to calls for help, if they're a tank.  They have to prioritize between different simultaneous problems to keep their group from being torn apart.  If they're the disease/snare/interrupt member, they have to quickly and efficiently pick out the most threatening members of a very large group of players and slow them down/interrupt them to keep them from decimating the gank group.  If they're a healer they have to constantly kite and keep themselves in a position where they have time to stop and pop a spread heal before getting interrupted, and they have to do it while keeping an eye on the location and health of their fellow party members.  I could go on, but I think I've backed up *MY* statement sufficiently.  Where's your explanation?
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Ok, please kill yourself now.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> How about no.  Unlike you, I'm not manic depressive/suicidal over a computer game.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;You're dead-weight. Their &quot;developed teamwork&quot; is normal teamwork. Their &quot;developed strategy&quot; is nothign special. It's common sense. Their &quot;reactionary skill&quot; is no more than anyone elses. Skill doesn't make you able to kill a group 10x your size, and if you think so, you are retarded.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> See above.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;The only time this could happen is if a pbae group caught a raid off guard while they were bunched up, which I've seen happen. That's dumb luck. Skill ha snothign to do with it. The other way it coudl happwn is if the big group was afk. All of them. If the small group is not pbae, thyey aren't going to beat a zerg unless they are cheating, which I have experienced in DF (solo savage killing 8 lvl 48+)&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> See: Free RPs 3.  They do use some PBAE, but sparingly, and they kill massive groups without stacking and PBAEing multiple times within the video.  That's all the evidence you need.  If you don't want to take the time to download and watch the evidence, then don't blame me and start making moronic excuses.  Here's a link to the search, in case you're especially lazy.

 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Are you purposely not paying attention just so in your mind, your retarded crap is justified?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Funny, I could say the same thing about you.  And my statement would actually be based on reason, rather than the insanity you so stubbornly cling to.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I hate them because 1. Of who they are.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> And who is that?  Last time I checked, members of gank groups are separate, individual people.  Great generalization, pal.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;And 2. Because they ruin the playing field for everyone else. Being good is making your class work.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> A gank group is built on a well-balanced set of different classes.  E.g.  3 tanks, 2 healers, 1-2 CCers, and 1-2 nukers/utility class(es).  They ARE making their classes work, and more importantly, they're making their classes work together.  It's called strategy.  The only way they ruin the game for somebody else is if you can't stand getting beaten because you were outplayed... in other words, if you're a pathetic kid who can't take failure.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Gank groups are fotmers who suck at their original class and abandon it.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Says who?  You?  I'm sure sometimes they do roll up a new toon to work with their gank group.  Other times they just happen to be playing that class and join the gank group because the group needs the class.  And even if they do roll up a toon just for that group, how does that make them &quot;fotmers&quot;?  They're exercising strategy, trying to build as efficient a single group as possible.  You know, that thing where you use your brain and think, strategize, and plan?  I guess you wouldn't know about that.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;It's not jealousy. It's just the fact that unliek you, I don't drool at the thought of them dropping their pants.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Again with the personal insults.  I don't even have to reply to this idiocy.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I would rather them all go get drunk and have a massive wreck and kill eachother&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Now you want anybody in a gank group to get drunk and KILL EACH OTHER?  This is a game, buddy.  First you tell me to kill myself, then you say anybody who's been in a group should just kill each other?  You really are low life scum.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;so I could have fun and not have to put up with a bunch of fotm rp whores who care only about their rp count.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Because your fun is the only thing that matters, right?  And everybody should just play the game in exactly the way that pleases you.  And you conveniently ASSume that a gank group *only* cares about their RP count.  Maybe they just want to the satisfaction of winning the competition that is PvP?  Ever think of that?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;That's your problem. You're trying to wrap your mind around the wrong thing because you've convinced yourself that gankers are, and that's that. You say they are taking the game to its max, but in reality, they dont give a damn at the game at all. They max a characte rin 2 days, which should be an accomplishemnt, but they go to such extremes that it kills it completely. The only thing they are an example of is common guttertrash.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> More ASSuming.  It's great how telepathic and all-knowing you are, to make such sweeping generalizations and assumptions about so many different people.  If they didn't care about the game, why would they work so hard to do well at it?  You've totally departed from logic at this point.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Now that was just stupid. Is that all you monkeys can say? &quot;You're a kid&quot;. &quot;come back when you grow up.&quot; &quot;stupid kid.&quot; &quot;Looks like the kids are out of school.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> And jealousy is a stupid emotion. There are only 2 true emotions. Anger and hate. These are the essence of humanity, and in the end, all the positives will degrade into these.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> You know, that started out good, until the whole &quot;There are only 2 true emotions&quot; part.  This is where you are a very sad human being.  I do pity you for having such a terrible outlook on life.  I hope you find help for that.  I suggest therapy, or perhaps religion of some kind.  I don't know what your personal fix is.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go for a little while. But please continue to try and say gankers are teh l337z and that everyoen else is a n00b.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> The only one I see talking in leet speak here is you.  I never said everyone else was a noob, or that they have any less worth than those who dedicate their time to forming a gank group.  But thanks for putting words in my mouth in a pathetic effort to make me look bad.

 <br> 
 <br> Anyway, here we go.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;The only thing I get a hard on for is my girlfriend (or possibly my pron collection). However, I recognize skill when I see it, unlike you.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Look, I already told you, there's no uber skill involved.  a f'in monkey can do it.  I've been offered spots in 2 gank groups and 1 large scale RvR guild when I decided to go solo, and because of the past experiences I had with them, I declined of course.  As for your gf and porn collection, you are one weak-minded pissant with no self control.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Okay, why, since you're so intent on supposedly proving I'm an idiot? Details. Evidence. Explanation. You didn't give me any of those things.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Can you ever really convince someone that they are an idiot?  I think your posts are good enough details, evidence, and explanation.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Gank groups have to have excellent communication. They have to juggle knowing where their fellow group members are at all times. They have to find them and respond immediately to calls for help, if they're a tank. They have to prioritize between different simultaneous problems to keep their group from being torn apart. If they're the disease/snare/interrupt member, they have to quickly and efficiently pick out the most threatening members of a very large group of players and slow them down/interrupt them to keep them from decimating the gank group. If they're a healer they have to constantly kite and keep themselves in a position where they have time to stop and pop a spread heal before getting interrupted, and they have to do it while keeping an eye on the location and health of their fellow party members. I could go on, but I think I've backed up *MY* statement sufficiently. Where's your explanation?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Yea, like I said.  Common sense.  IMO every group should operate like that, but what you don't understand is that I've seen the kind of extremes they will go to, and it's just pathetic and sick.  It's beyond a game, and beyond fun.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;How about no. Unlike you, I'm not manic depressive/suicidal over a computer game.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I'm not.  And this goes beyond &quot;the game.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;See above.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Huh?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;See: Free RPs 3. They do use some PBAE, but sparingly, and they kill massive groups without stacking and PBAEing multiple times within the video. That's all the evidence you need. If you don't want to take the time to download and watch the evidence, then don't blame me and start making moronic excuses. Here's a link to the search, in case you're especially lazy.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> First off, the thing won't play.  However, I've probably seen it before.  Just FYI, there are ways to cheat in DAoC.  And I'm talking cheat, not stuff like radar.  That savage I mentioned earlier was banned for cheating.  Bottom line is there' sno goddamn way for a small group to be taking out big groups of the same level unless they are pbae bombers, or cheaters.  They would have to be 1.  Invincible, and 2.  Be hitting everyone for 1000+ every single hit.  Neither of which are achievable on a scale that could justify 10 ppl killing 100.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Funny, I could say the same thing about you. And my statement would actually be based on reason, rather than the insanity you so stubbornly cling to.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I guess that's your opinion.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;And who is that? Last time I checked, members of gank groups are separate, individual people. Great generalization, pal.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Funny.  I'm the one who picked through some of their forums.  Yes they are individual, but they have to be like-minded to be able to function together effectively.  I've already stated what I saw.  I've never seen any decent behavior from them.  Any of them.  They're not well educated family types.  They're those morons who drop out of school to become a mehcanic in daddys garage because &quot;it's easy&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;A gank group is built on a well-balanced set of different classes. E.g. 3 tanks, 2 healers, 1-2 CCers, and 1-2 nukers/utility class(es). They ARE making their classes work, and more importantly, they're making their classes work together. It's called strategy. The only way they ruin the game for somebody else is if you can't stand getting beaten because you were outplayed... in other words, if you're a pathetic kid who can't take failure.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Yea, that's one build, and back in the old days, was one of my favorite setups when forming groups, but again with the extremes that I've seen, the group really doesn't matter so much.  They do things that nobody who is playing for fun would consider.  It's pathetic th elengths they will go to for rps.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Says who? You? I'm sure sometimes they do roll up a new toon to work with their gank group. Other times they just happen to be playing that class and join the gank group because the group needs the class. And even if they do roll up a toon just for that group, how does that make them &quot;fotmers&quot;? They're exercising strategy, trying to build as efficient a single group as possible. You know, that thing where you use your brain and think, strategize, and plan? I guess you wouldn't know about that.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Says me, yes.  If they can't completely run through everyoen they meet, they will reroll and plvl eachoteh rto 50 in a few days.  And it doesn't matter if they roll the char for that group.  fotm is fotm, and if anything, rolling one for a gank group is even MORE fotm, not excused from being fotm as you seem to think.  As for the strategy garbage, that entire statement was nothing but a BS insult, so I'll move on.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Again with the personal insults. I don't even have to reply to this idiocy.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I could have said the same to you  afew times as well.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Now you want anybody in a gank group to get drunk and KILL EACH OTHER? This is a game, buddy. First you tell me to kill myself, then you say anybody who's been in a group should just kill each other? You really are low life scum.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Some people deserve to die.  That's it.  A human life isn't anything special.  People live and die all the time.  It's a game, but there are real people behind the game, and that's the whole point of this.  And no, lowlife scum is like the guy who was bragging about the cat he ran over, or the 2 morons who were bragging about what they did to their mom when she disciplined them for smoking.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Because your fun is the only thing that matters, right? And everybody should just play the game in exactly the way that pleases you. And you conveniently ASSume that a gank group *only* cares about their RP count. Maybe they just want to the satisfaction of winning the competition that is PvP? Ever think of that?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Yes, I thoguth about it, and hearing them in chat groups proved my original impressions.  The forums were just icing on the cake.  I'm not assuming anything.  I'm telling you what I saw.  They aren't in it fo rfun.  They want recognition, and rps is the way you get them, so they will go to any length to boost their rps.  This is what they have shown me, so it's what I believe.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;More ASSuming. It's great how telepathic and all-knowing you are, to make such sweeping generalizations and assumptions about so many different people. If they didn't care about the game, why would they work so hard to do well at it? You've totally departed from logic at this point.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> People are faceless morons who are too weak to be who they are, so they all act liek eachother.  That's why generalizations occur.  Why woudl they work for it if they don't do it for fun?  To be recognized.  To feel like they are gods because they have high rps.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;You know, that started out good, until the whole &quot;There are only 2 true emotions&quot; part. This is where you are a very sad human being. I do pity you for having such a terrible outlook on life. I hope you find help for that. I suggest therapy, or perhaps religion of some kind. I don't know what your personal fix is.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I'm not sad.  I was, until I accepted these things.  An dI don't pity me.  As far as I know, I'm one of few who will openly speak about the truth and not wear the pink bunny goggles that you all wear where life is great.  I don't need help.  I don't need therapy, and I don't need religion.  Religion is fake.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;The only one I see talking in leet speak here is you. I never said everyone else was a noob, or that they have any less worth than those who dedicate their time to forming a gank group. But thanks for putting words in my mouth in a pathetic effort to make me look bad.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I use it to poke fun at people who act like d00ds.  And you're sure implying that everyone else is a n00b.  Anyway, you're doign a good enough job of making yourself look bad without my help.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Now, I've already used this link this week, but I can't resist posting it again: 
 <br> 
 <br> <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041130232604/http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/you.html&quot;">http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/you.html&quot;</a> <br> 
 <br> I already know what that is, and do you honestly think posting a link as opposed to openly calling me an idiot makes you any more clever, or makes the insult hold any more weight?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Watch that for a long time and please try to digest its contents before you post again.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> No.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;This is my last flame in this little war, because quite frankly, you're not worth my time. Flame back if you like, I will not respond.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> The old &quot;you're not worth my time&quot; path, huh?  Yeah, we've all heard it.  It doesn't make you seem superior.  It's just a cop out.  Especially after you've spent so much time posting this stuff.  As if it matters if you post or not?  I know you're going to read it.
 <br> 
 <br> So, anyway, all this garbage mean sone thing.  And on topic, if WoW take son a pvp reward system like DAoC, it's going to attract and hold more extremist ganker types, so I stand by my bad idea response.  People should pvp for fun, not because they want everyone else to know their name.

 <br> 
 <br> Did radar become a common thing in daoc? yeah. Was it in any form restricted to 8 man grps? No. I seen tons of radar enabled zergs and trust me its 10 times worse then running into 8 man grp using it. Probably half of the solo stealth gankers used radar too. The whole thing with people cheating to gain more dmg/speed whatever its just an ecuse. Everyone can run logs and record dmg done to them. I never seen anyone prove with actual evidence that there was a way to bug yourself into hitting people for ubnormal dmg. Oh I heard 1000 claims with &quot;cheat program&quot; included but I am not that stupid to as to buy into every attempt to put trojan into my system.
 <br> 
 <br> To put it simply gank guilds in daoc were collection of invdividuals who got sick of being in pickup grps where people acted like complete idiots. They got together to play as a team and win. Will this happen in WoW? You bet. It happened in Shadowbane, L2 where there were no looting or RP rewards yet perfect guild grps were formed and dominated open pvp.

RA's only added more 'I-WIN' buttons to the game and the game already had enough of those in the form of insta-stun and insta-mez.  In the beginning it was RA's like Group purge, SoS, and Determination.  With the release of NF's it's RA's like TWF, Static Tempest, and some of the RR5 RA's.
 <br> 
 <br> Those 'I-WIN' buttons are bad for the game.  Someone said that a RR3 could beat a RR6.  That's not at all likely considering a RR3 only has 20 realm skill points and a RR5+ has over 40 realm skill points.  Take the case of a RR3 who has no artifacts and no ML's in a fight with a RR5 who is ML 10.  Say the RR5 is a ML 10 Battlemaster who has TWF 3.  The RR5/ML10 player can drop TWF 3 which will do from 1500 - 2500 points of damage if the enemy player stays in the field for the duration of the effect.  The RR5 being a Battlemaster can also spam Grapple on the enemy which will force the enemy to stay in the field.  The RR3 can't even afford to buy TWF 3 because the cost of TWF 3 is 30 realm skill poins and a RR3 only has 20 available.  It's nothing more than a situation to where the RR5/ML10 has an 'I-WIN' button and the RR3/ML0 gets farmed.
 <br> 
 <br> Had RA's only given characters access to aug. stats, low level health/end/mana regen, and maybe a few other modest abilities then it wouldn't have been bad.  The gains would have been very small and wouldn't have turned into the 'I-WIN' buttons that are bad for all games.  Mythic never designed DAoC to be about skill though.  They designed it so that someone could spend countless hours more than someone else and gain abilites that would void all skill.

 <br> 
 <br> No.  Keep walking.
 <br> 
 <br> As for the radarers, you're right.  Soloers use them, zergs use them.  However, almost all of the gankers I popped in on have openly discussed them, and that's why I put it with them.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;To put it simply gank guilds in daoc were collection of invdividuals who got sick of being in pickup grps where people acted like complete idiots. They got together to play as a team and win.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Ironic that these very people usualy ARE the idiots.  Not sharing info, not cooperating with who's in charge.  Blaming everyone else when they die.  I even remember groups where ppl would not attack the enemy till he was nearly dead so they would make sure they got the last hit and they would get killspam.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Will this happen in WoW? You bet. It happened in Shadowbane, L2 where there were no looting or RP rewards yet perfect guild grps were formed and dominated open pvp.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> True, it happens, but it thins them out somewhat.  There would have been alot more if you got rewards.
