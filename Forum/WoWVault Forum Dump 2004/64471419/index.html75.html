					Okay, I know that everquest in it's current form is a boring, repetitive grind that is more work than fun, but this was not always the case.   There are definite reasons for the games rise from obscurity to dominate the genre in western markets.  There was a LOT that the game did right, especially in the early days.  (Though each successive expansion detracted from it somewhat.)  The game was a pioneer in the field, and every other game that sought to &quot;dethrone&quot; it has ultimately failed to a greater or lesser degree.  I think a big reason for this is that the game's original vision was not to be &quot;immersive&quot; or &quot;realistic&quot;, but to be fun to play.  That&#8217;s why most the MMORPGs developed my EQ's competition are so dull in comparison - they are the product of developer masturbation.  Think of the difference between a MUD and a hard core MUSH, which one is more fun?  The one where you can be a warrior, cleric, or wizard and kill monsters all day, or the one that forces the majority of the player base to be a peasant, tailor, or blacksmith while only a elite few actually get to do something interesting?
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 	The fact that the original everquest wasn't created solely for it's developer's self-gratification doesn't mean it gave it's player base everything it asked for. The game avoided sacrificing fun and challenge for the sake of BOTH the developers' and the players' whims.  The result was a system that was based on the concept of &quot;risk vs. reward&quot; - a term that has virtually disappeared from MMORPG discussions these days.  I think this notion is why people regard EQ's best features as it's biggest flaws.  People want to have their cake and eat it to.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 	A major example of &quot;risk vs. reward&quot; in action was the corpse retrieval.  The CR not only gave meaning to death, it also increased the element of risk in certain areas.  If you wanted to hunt in a dungeon that had great loot and a great experience bonus, you had to risk a tough corpse retrieval - and possibly multiple deaths.  If you played it safe and hunted in outdoor zones then you would level slower and receive less interesting loot.  The concept of risk vs. reward created a huge element of excitement when hunting in dangerous zones that made it seem more than a mere grind.  When there is actually something at stake, hunting becomes more of an adventure and less of a test to see who can put up with the more mind-numbing camping for the longest amount of time.  Also, before the release of Kunark and zones that were filled with &quot;see invis&quot; mobs, CRs could actually be fun.  Would I make it to the corpse before my invis fades?  If I do, will it fade wile I'm dragging the corpse?  And if it does, will I make it to the zone in time?  For me, CRs in the Old World were some of the funest moments of the game.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 	Another thing people often criticize EQ about is the notion of class dependence.  (The &quot;holy trinity&quot; of the Warrior, Enchanter, and Cleric are often cited as the most glaring examples.)  The thing was, before Kunark came out, there really was no &quot;holy Trinity&quot;.  Druids and Shamans couldn't heal quite as well as clerics, but they could do well enough that any group could manage without one.  Paladins and Shadowknights could tank almost as well as a warrior.  Also, a group with a good monk, shadowknight or necromancer could do fine without an enchanter.  The original everquest didn't have class dependence, it had ROLE dependence.  Every member of a party had a different job to do - and this lead to teamwork and, dare I say it, strategy.  While it's true that a party full of Warriors wasn't going to get very far in EQ, it was better than the current alternatives - where one person pulls a mob and everyone else just beats on it.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 	People also accuse EQ's class based system of forcing everyone to be the same, and this leads to a bunch of cookie cutter characters that are ultimately the same.  I think the opposite is true - that EQ hast the MOST character diversity of any major MMORPG on the market today.  One reason for EQ's diversity is that a player's race selection has little to no impact of his combat abilities.  Therefore you don&#8217;t see a world where all the warrior are dwarves, all the paladins are humans, and all the mages are elves.  Another reason for character diversity is that a class based system only allows for a certain degree of specialization.  Everquest had 12 more or less viable classes, but an unlimited skill based system like Asheron's Call had three - an archer with some healing and buffing skills, a melee character with some buffing and healing skills, and a mage with some buffing and healing skills.  The reason is because a character that specialized in doing only one thing was much stronger than a character spreads his skills out over a verity of  areas.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 	I could go on, but the point is that so many of everquet's competitors failed because the refused to acknowledge the things in the game that worked.  They claimed to get rid of the repetitive level grind by softening death penalties, but instead this made the grind more repetitive.  The claimed to make more diverse characters by adding a skill based system, but instead created a system where a few flavor of the month characters were king.  The claimed to make items more interesting by adding randomly generated loot, but instead created loot that was essentially the same as all the other loot, but with different numbers.  They promised to create more immersive worlds by adding things like player-run economies, but instead created worlds that were dull and ultimately un-engaging.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 	I hope WoW doesn't continue this trend.

				I have never played EQ so I can't really comment from personal experience. But in regards to your post I have to say that I am a fan of harsh death penalties and I agree that they add to gameplay. 
 <br> 
 <br> So many people nowadays seem to be supporting soft or even NO death penalties and I honestly dont see why other than everyone wants their character to be a god that never experiences any negative side effects to his or her actions. These are not the type of games for this. More and more people also seem to be against full PvP in a factional sense. They want it in zones.
 <br> 
 <br> I find zoned PvP boring. No PvP is even worse. I'm sorry but questing all day long for the wand of wootcasting or killing AI monsters gets boring 50x faster than combat against other players. This game in particular is supposed to be Warcraft not lets go fight in the sandbox and when we are done go back to happy land no-PvP area and dance in a circle around a campfire with all of our shiny new items that we never want to lose when we die no matter what. 
 <br> 
 <br> It was a relief to read the post saying there will be servers will different rulesets favoring things such as kill anyone anywhere.

				<span style="color: Darkred;"><span style="font-weight:bold;"> Nice post. 
 <br> 
 <br> There is nothing really wrong with EQ, it just gets stale after years. Any game would.
 <br>  
 <br> People say that the only reason EQ is so big is because it was first (in a way). That's not true, it's number one because it did <i>something</i> right and became the best. 
 <br> It's kinda like Microsoft or Starbucks. Alot of people hate them based on their dominance of the field, rather than their actual products.  
 <br> 
 <br> There is absolutly nothing Blizzard can do to keep people for years and years in WoW. They could make the best MMO ever, and people will still get bored and quit. It's the nature of the beast. </span></span>

				Disco is exactly right when it comes to the point he is talking about regarding MMORPGs.
 <br> 
 <br> People will always quit the game eventually no matter how good it is. The better the game is and the more things there are to do the longer people will play it.
 <br> 
 <br> The better the game the longer it's life will be. Ideally a &quot;good&quot; MMORPG would remain FUN, engaging, and entertaining for a player for at *least* a year or more of active playing. A crappy MMORPG such as many we have seen in recent releases will only keep a player entertained for a few months - maybe even a month or less if it is really bad.

				You can never really remember your first love as a bad experience if enough time passed. Thats the way EQ is for me. Although I played some UO , EQ was my first real MMORPG addictive game and after few years of not playing it, I will always remember it as some special experience. With lots of unique and joyful memories.
 <br> But that doesnt mean I will play it today. Its old and really not right for me - death penalty, too group oriented, character development, graphics and I can probably go on and on. 
 <br> But maybe thats besides the point. Now days we have so many games to choose from, people can say what ever they want about these games. Eq still has a really huge player base, and EQ2 will be just as big.
 <br> 
 <br> Personally taking into account my fun factors - I will probably buy WoW and UXO.

				People that bash EQ are usually the same people that bash MS, or whatever.  There's not really any point in arguing with them.  Sure EQ did some things wrong, no one is arguing that point, but they did a lot of things right, obviously.

				In the end all MMORPGs end up bieng the same? People said DAoC wouldn't turn into a EQ rip, but with ToA and all the Pve you are now &quot;forced&quot; to do..its just like EQ but with a horribly gimped &quot;RVR&quot; system.
 <br> 
 <br> Ive played EQ for a good 3-4 years, and i played DAoC up until the release of TOA...and i really hope that they do not turn WoW into a EQ offshoot in WoW's later years like other games seem to do.
 <br> 
 <br> MMOGs suffer from a &quot;final level syndrome&quot; meaning at one point it is possible for your character to have the best items, best spells, best records ( via pvp ), highest level and so forth. But what the companies due in response to this is raise the bar even higher, and once those guys reach that again they are forced to do it once more..thus turning the equation of &quot;14 play days = Level 50 char in daoc&quot; into something horridly longer..
 <br>

				My 3 biggest complaints with EQ were mind-numbingly horrible graphics, possibly the worst GUI ever created and forced grouping to do anything of worth.
 <br> 
 <br> The graphics really were so bad I just could not get into the game. The GUI I could have gotten used to so not a real game-breaker. Forced grouping is a major no-no in my book, I don't always have time for a long session of team hunting and EQ left people like me no choice but to quit.
 <br> 
 <br> If you could tolerate the graphics and group hunting is your thing, then EQ has a lot to offer. I don't hate the game, it just very definately is not for me. The beauty in todays MMORPG landscape is that choice is becoming the norm, we all win in these circumstances.

				&quot;EQ has the worst graphics I have ever seen in any game ever.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I have to disagree 100% with you here, eventhough I understand that this is a matter of personal taste.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ graphics has been imroved several times:
 <br> 
 <br> Original EQ - released in 1999 , had good graphics for 1999
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 1: Kunark - texture update and higher complexity MOBs and world objects in Kunark
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 2: Velious - armor texture updates, higher poly NPC graphics in Velious
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 3: Luclin - player model revamp, armor model revamp, new textures new NPC models
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 4: Planes of Power - more weapon models , more NPC models
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 5: Legacy of Ykesha: PoP level of graphics some new NPC models
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 6: Lost Dungeons - higher poly models for both MOBs and world objects in the new expansion
 <br> 
 <br> Expansion 7: Gates of Discord: same quality of NPC models as LDON
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I actually think that looking at new NPC models in LDON and GoD, they look very nice and the zone textures are also very nice. As a matter of fact I'd say that EQ is still has very decent graphics (considering that it's a FIVE year old game!!!) if you look at the more recent expansions.
 <br> 
 <br> Certainly far from &quot;the worst graphics&quot;.

				I think every one of your 'pro' EQ arguments was one of the reasons I complained about the game.  
 <br> 
 <br> And yes ever since release its always been a mindless,cookie-cutter, level-grind,loot whoring, negative experience that you must pay a fee for.
 <br> 
 <br> I certainly hope that WoW will have more creative options for players and appeal both to casual and powergamers.

				I have to agree with alot of what you said. I loved EQ for the longest time, in some ways I still do. Would go back to it but I am not that crazy.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ did the one thing right that I haven't seen anyone do in a long time. Make PVE worth experiencing. There were so many hilarious moments in EQ PVE that made the game so worth playing. Not to mention I felt like I was really in a world that had a sense of individuality. Were my choices had atleast some marginal effect on my fate. 
 <br> 
 <br> I used to love going into Crushbone with my DE enchanter and killing everything there. I was in the middle of Neriak one night and suddenly the ambassador to crushbone took one look at me and grabbed his sword. It was a mad dash to get out of there let me tell you. 
 <br> 
 <br> The major thing I have to say I did hate about EQ was the Classes. Bottomline while the beginning was relatively good the ending was not. Too many people not wanting people in groups because of who they were and to few unique abilities. I also found EQ stretched itself to thin with classes. This is of course just my opinion. I loved the races though and thier interaction. I especially loved the idea of sneaking through freeports sewers.
 <br> 
 <br> I think one of EQ's strongest pulls aside from phat lewt was its faction system. You could work your faction any way you wanted. The enchanter was by far the most fun class I have ever played in a MMO as well I would have to say. Though my Sorc did come close in DAOC just no illusions :P

				I certainly don't hate EQ. I don't play it anymore because, well, I just got tired of it. But after 4 years in one game, I'd say I more than got my money's worth. I wasted countless hours of my life in that game, and I don't regret it at all. It was simply time to move on, that's all.

				The origional EQ DID have somthing to offer POwergames and casual gamers.  In fact, the origonal EQ was more geared to casual gamers than most MMORPGS on the market today.  It was only when Kunark and the 10 extra hell levels came out that EQ became focused on powergaming.

				&quot;I think every one of your 'pro' EQ arguments was one of the reasons I complained about the game.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Funny how that works. I think every one of his pro-EQ statements is a reason I loved the game (and still do). 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> What's really interesting is that there is an experiment going on right now called &quot;Horizons&quot;, which is a game that was essentially built as the &quot;anti-EQ&quot;. They took everything people complained about in Everquest and went 180 degrees in the other direction. The result has been pretty pathetic so far. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> People have every right to criticize Everquest - they didn't get everything right. But, I think they did get most of the fundamentals correct. Things like class dependency, grouping, uber mob encounters, all of the unique dungeons and home cities... those things helped create a special atmosphere that made Everquest a fun and addictive game to play. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I know the grouping and class dependency pissed people off - I know there were nights when I logged off in frustration because I couldn't find a group either. But the vast majority of the time I did find groups, or have guild raids, or have *something* to do. And those occassions were always more fun than doing anything solo, in an MMORPG or otherwise. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I loved how the cities in EQ were unique (many with their own music). I mean, who didn't feel awestruck the first time you started up a wood elf in the tree city of Kelethin? 
 <br> 
 <br> Who can forget the music in the halfling city of Rivervale? I laugh every time I go through there. 
 <br> 
 <br> And what about the dungeons in EQ? Who can forget the first time they crawled into Blackburrow, or Befallen, or Cazic Thule, or GUk (with all the corpses at the entryway...) Or sliding along the slopes of Velkitor's Labrynth, or navigating the confusing tunnels of Solusek B, or watching a 40-dark elf train run by you in Mistmoore Castle, and then realizing they were going to come back and get you! 
 <br> 
 <br> And what about the first time you saw Nagefan up-close and personal? Or the first time you zoned into the Plane of Fear, after being repeatidly warned to &quot;Die where you are!&quot; if you got hit by something.
 <br> 
 <br> (I remember my guild's first Fear run. 12 hours later we downed Cazic Thule. I was the first person in my guild to get killed by CT's Death Touch, back in the old days when he DT'ed every 30 seconds). 
 <br> 
 <br> What about the first time you saw you the named dragons in ToV - weren't you just blown away? Or how about the Ring War in Great Divide? The first time you fought Trakanon, and he ported your sorry butt to the mushrooms!
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Everquest had it flaws, sure. But it also had some of the most memorable content ever. I remember more encounters and stories from that game than I remember from all my other games, MUDS, MMORPG's and single-player games COMBINED. 
 <br> 
 <br> Everquest was a great game. Still is a great game for the people who have the time and the guild to commit to it. I wish I still had that kind of time. 
 <br> 
 <br> I can only hope WoW lives up to what Everquest started. If WoW can provide that kind of memorable gameplay... I will be truly happy.

				I just saw a friend play the latest expansion of EQ on a 3.2 P4 with a ATI 9800 XT and it still looks like the biggest pile of dung I have ever seen. Seriously I had games on my 486 10 years ago that looked better.
 <br>

				I'd probably have to play again ... to regain my perspective  ... 
 <br> 
 <br> but I think the whole CR routine, the chance of loosing all your armor, coupled with long downtime, and the level grind ... drove me away.  
 <br> 
 <br> And all of that is pretty much what's wrong with EQ <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040928131205im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/4.gif" border="0" alt="grin" hspace="0" vspace="0">

 <br> I'm playing Camelot ATM and it's a lot better for a casual gamer. 
 <br> 
 <br> Soloing Seafuries at level 51, in OOT with my Shaman for 100's of hours did me in.  I made 52 and then I'm like... I'm done.  At that time a lot of Spells were impossible to find as well.

				What was so bad?
 <br> 
 <br> 1 - A leveling treadmill that made DAOC seem a piece of cake.
 <br> 
 <br> 2 - Harsh death penalties that could erase weeks of leveling and even lose you a level.
 <br> 
 <br> 3 - Corpse runs.  Unlike you, I dont enjoy travelling across multiple zones with no equipment just to get my stuff back.  Ever been abandoned by a group after a wipeout?  Its no fun.
 <br> 
 <br> 4 - Kill Stealers / Loot grabbers.  Enough said, it was rampant even in the early days.
 <br> 
 <br> 5 - Camp Hogs. I finally quit the game when I spent a whole evening just trying to find a spot to xp at. I realized a game where you spent more time trying to find something to do than actually playing - sucks.
 <br> 
 <br> 6 - Greed. This happens to virtually every online game eventually. It wasnt like that in the early days of DAOC, but they're turning it into EQ.  The greed factor was build into EQ from the beginning.
