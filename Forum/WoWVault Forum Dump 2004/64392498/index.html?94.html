			<td class="BoardRowB" colspan="2" width="83%">
				I had a look at Blizzard's lovely site. They really do hire good webmasters, as all of their webpages are first class material. 
 <br> 
 <br> To be honest what brought me here is the absolute slew of people who can't say enough about how good WoW will be, how they can't wait for it, how it'll not only kill DAOC but also EQ2 when it too is released. 
 <br> 
 <br> I remember a long time ago sitting at the North-west Blacksmith's shop in Britain on the Pacific server discussing with the fellow making my armour and the people sitting around him (at least 30% d3wds I'm sure) this new game that's coming out. It was called EverQuest or something. 3D, you say? Sheesh. That'll be laggy. Oh well, it'll definitely be better than all the bugs/griefers/whatever/insert-gripe-here's in UO right? Then it came out and everyone flocked there, and then, (after the myriad problems that arrived at launch) a few years later, people found that EQ had its' long-term problems too. Not just bugs and glitches, but things that made people unhappy, made people think their class was useless, nerfs etc. It was then that some of the quicker people, and certainly the erm.. nice folk at SOE.. realised that you couldn't please everyone. Looking at DAOC and SWG (not to mention the other less memorable &quot;failures&quot; on the way) it doesn't seem to have changed. People still think their class is underpowered, or that this particular nerf spells the end of this game and that, once again, &quot;Enter New MMORPG title here&quot; is going to ruin &quot;Enter Current MMORPG title that everyone is playing here&quot;. It's almost cyclic.
 <br> 
 <br> Now I don't want to cast dispraging thoughts upon this potentially good game, but if you look through the fact that Blizzard has a good track record (and only in single-player games mind you, I don't consider Battle.net in the same league as MMORPGs), doesn't the MMORPG industry have a bad enough track record itself that WoW could go down the same path as the rest?
 <br> 
 <br> Don't get me wrong. I love MMORPGs and can hardly play single player games anymore unless they're very engrossing. But after a few years, a game /will/ get boring, and in the end, you can never really make everyone happy. The very fact that in a single-player game the developer can make you the hero means everything, but in a MMORPG you have to share the limelight with others. Thousands of others. So if someone is happy, someone will always, in my opinion, be unhappy. Whether it's an enemy realm feeling that they're underpowered on a frontier (like in DAOC), or a fellow tank class who believes that this new ability of another class will encroach upon a) his ability to find a group, b) his personal character concept or a number of other things.
 <br> 
 <br> The second thing that this issue raises is the fact that WoW /is/ (and I know you'll scream at this) going to be a lot like other MMORPGs. I read sme of Blizzard's FAQ plus TehSuq's very adept description of his experiences at GenCon. Apart from the graphical differences (which I would expect given it's a /new/ game. Would hate to see it look like DAOC or especially EQ so long after they'd been released. Ugh.) I don't see a lot of new stuff. There is new stuff so don't start posting madly to tell me what it is, but essentially all of it is the same RPG stuff we've been getting since D&amp;D.
 <br> 
 <br> A lot of stuff has also been pilfered from other games. The /release function, styles, Realm vs. Realm combat (including a lack of communication inter-realm) are all featured in other games, just to name a few. You must understand it's easy to take the best of past games, put better graphics AND add your own cool things.
 <br> 
 <br> I guess I'm not sure what I'm saying here lol. Perhaps I just want to warn.. hmm.. maybe that's not the right word.. I guess I just want to lend some experience to the whole MMORPG thing, which I'm sure some (maybe most?) have too, but I dare say some do not. In any case, the main thing I want to say is stop telling me how good WoW will be until you've actually played it, and then until you've played it for a couple of years. Then tell me you're not looking forward, once again, to the &quot;next best thing&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> I think that's it. Let the flames begin.
 <br> 
 <br> Respectfully, (except to you Albs out there <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916025420im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/3.gif" border="0" alt="wink" hspace="0" vspace="0"> )

				I don't think anyone really thinks that WoW will be perfect. Most just seem to speak about the positive things that they are expecting from new games.
 <br> 
 <br> Something I've noticed about MMORPGs is that, aside from the first big 3 (UO, EQ, &amp; AC) all of the other games that are enjoying a decent subscription rate probably brought more people to play MMORPGs then they stole from existing games. WoW will be one of those games. So regardless of if WoW takes any significant chunk of players from other existing games it will certainly bring in a great number of new players for MMORPGs.

				Yes it is possible.  It is also possible that I will win the lottery &lt;keeps his hopes high&gt;.
 <br> 
 <br> Chances are that WoW will raise the bar just like EQ and DAoC did for MMORPGs.  I firmly believe this because of Blizzard's track record and the developers intent.
 <br> 
 <br> One thing that pumps me up is their desire to <span style="font-weight:bold;">KILL</span> time sinks.  I think that is one thing that plagues MMORPGs and it will be great to have a game that will not be filled with them.
 <br> 
 <br> It is just my pre-beta opinion.  And honestly, until the game is released, anything said will be an opinion because it is subject to change!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916025420im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">

				I agree with you. WoW will bring in many players simply because it's Blizzard. I know 3 people whom I've never been able to interest to play MMORPGs before telling me how awesome this game will be, simply because it's amde by Blizzard.

 <br> I don't know - I hope they won't get turned off if it's a flop.

				&quot;One thing that pumps me up is their desire to KILL time sinks. I think that is one thing that plagues MMORPGs and it will be great to have a game that will not be filled with them. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> This is what every company says about every MMORPG currenly in development. The devs always impress everybody during Alpha/Beta with their positive attitude and eagarness to do stuff.
 <br> 
 <br> Remember how Mythic was praised before the game was released as &quot;willing to eliminate timesinks?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> How many will deliver on this promise? Probably none.
 <br> 
 <br> Look at WoW, significant portion of Wow is all PvE and the treadmil to reach top level I bet you there will be some timesinks in there.
 <br> 
 <br> Every MMORPG has a desire to kill the sinks, but if the game is too simple than everybody gets bored and quits.
 <br> 
 <br> Bottom line, the only thing that matters is the state of the game when it goes retail.

				First of all, no MMORPG &quot;fails.&quot; Shadowbane was a failure, but people are still paying for it. SWG was a failure, but a whole lotta people are still paying for that.
 <br> 
 <br> The single determining factor of my interest in WoW was the lore. I got burnt the hell out on MMORPGs on EQ. I played from beta 4 until about 5 months after Luclin. I haven't even wanted to see an MMORPG box since then.
 <br> 
 <br> Besides, if you're the MMORPG veteran you say you are, you shouldn't even be posting this. It's the same routine for every MMORPG that comes out. You've got a few rabid fanboys here and there, then you have several wiseass posters who are so funny and smart and everyone laughs at their messages, a few drifting rationalists, a flock of part-time posters, and random flamers. We should all just stop posting. We're in a time rift, destined to forever post the same messages.

				Was about to say that jjobaber. Good response. The main thing I'm saying is that Blizzard's promises aren't any different than those from Mythic Entertainment or Verant Interactive (SOE before conglomeration).

				Yeah I played UO and ran off to EQ too, it was a better game for the most part, at least in my opinion.  Although it did have its flaws, and still does to some extent.  As for WoW, I don't think it will fail, but whether it will be the Everquest killer remains to be seen.  A lot remains to be seen about it, actually. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916025420im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">

				All games have a hype to them, I think this one has more then others.  I can tell by the large fanbase surrounding Blizzard and battering them with nonstop questions.  I also feel based on Blizzard's past experience in gaming and what i've seen so far, that this will be a great game.  But as SLS says, we'll find out soon enough.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Yes btw, there is always that thought in the back of my mind, that the game will stink.  But that's what beta is for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916025420im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/9.gif" border="0" alt="tongue" hspace="0" vspace="0">

				Another very key thing to keep in mind is that MMORPG players are VERY fickle and though Blizzard may have a TON of rabid fans now, this could change quickly.
 <br> 
 <br> Devs do a nerf here , a change there and before you know it , those hardcore fans turn to &quot;WoW SUCKS and Blizzard sucks!&quot; crowd.

				Ya... but don't forget there haven't been any new very good mmorpgs latley... unless you count FFXI, but thats technically over a year old. 
 <br> 
 <br> You will have mmorpg'ers comming to WoW AND alot of the people that played WC 2 &amp; 3.
 <br> They are bringing a new batch of players into the mmorpg realm, and that helps future games, giving them potentially a larger player base.  No matter how WoW turns out, it will still attact more people to MMORPGS, which is a good thing for the companies that have games commin out in the future.

				Just because a company does not shut a game down does not mean it has not failed.Failing is anything where you do not make enough to cover your cost and make a profit.
 <br> 
 <br> If you are losing money or just breaking even ,that is not a success its a failure.People are in this business to make money not break even.
 <br> 
 <br> Anyone looking at games like Shadowbane,Horizons ,Neocron,Eve,AC 2 cannot honestly describe them as anything but failures.

				Hello,
 <br> 
 <br> Iv'e been a Gamer now for over 17 yrs. and I'd like to clear some things up.
 <br> 
 <br> ITS ALL ABOUT RAISING THE BAR.
 <br> 
 <br> Think of the whole Industry as a Huge Poker Game.
 <br> 
 <br> Each Company raising the Stakes in hopes of Winning the Pot (US).
 <br> 
 <br> ANY GAME WILL NEVER BE AN END ALL JUST ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS THE FUTURE.
 <br> 
 <br> The Gaming Industry grows while another Entertainment Industry dwindles (TV).
 <br> 
 <br> I'm Excited because I've seen Sierra Online (1984) and still realize after all these Years the surface hasnt even been scratched.
 <br> 
 <br> Another thing that I'm watching for is with the New CPU's and New Internet Connections in Theory the Server soft Cap could be raised to 6k-10k. It's all exciting and exspect anything.

				Sure, WoW is 'the next big thing' in MMO. There is always one. Last year it was Shadowbane or SWG. This year is is Lineage II or WoW. 
 <br> 
 <br> When this crop of games shift from concept to reality and people actually play them some percentage will hate them. They will become disillusioned and move to the DAoC II or Sims: Battle Date Arena (or whatever) boards and proclaim THAT as the 'Next Big Thing'. 
 <br> 
 <br> And thus the life cycle goes on....

 <br> (I will admit the fanboism and hype for this game have been really high. I also think this looks like a pretty strong game. Time will tell.)

				&#8220;But after a few years, a game /will/ get boring, and in the end, you can never really make everyone happy.&#8221;
 <br> 
 <br> In today&#8217;s gaming market where my husband beats and is bored with a $50 game in a week or two, I think that getting bored with a mmorpg after &#8220;a few years&#8221; is a pretty amazing task by those game makers. Games aren&#8217;t going to entertain forever. I know this going into WoW, that this could be my game of choice for the next 2 years or more, if it suites my playstyle. But I&#8217;m not gullible enough to think that, &#8220;this is it! this will be the last game I ever purchase!&#8221; 
 <br> EQ has lost some players, even had players hate it since the beginning, but it&#8217;s also had a large population of loyal players for what, like 5 years now? That&#8217;s an amazing success for any style of game, whether it suites me or not. 
 <br> WoW will pull some population from other games, but I don&#8217;t think it will kill any of them that weren&#8217;t on their way out anyway. It will satisfy those that enjoy the playstyle it creates. It's as simple as that. I don't beleive any game will ever make everyone happy. And I won&#8217;t say how good WoW is because I haven&#8217;t played it, but I am looking forward to it based on what I&#8217;ve read about it.

				I am surprised that this thread didn't turn into a love fest for Blizzard.
 <br> 
 <br> Anyway, I agree with most of the people who said that WoW is just another step in the evolution of MMPGs.  Some new ideas and rethinking some old ideas that worked.  No game is truely revolutionary anymore since they all need each other to grow by learning the good and the bad of MMPGs.  Some companies just repeat the bad for some reason.
 <br> 
 <br> There will always be bugs, people who dislike it and hard core gammers.  What we don't know about WOW is the amounts of each.
 <br> 
 <br> Be well
