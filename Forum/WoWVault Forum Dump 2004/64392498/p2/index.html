				I am not expecting everything to go 100% with WoW. No MMO's has had a 110% success rate as it stands upon release. 
 <br> 
 <br> I know blizzard will try very hard to release a bug free stable game. They may miss some things along the way but like most company's they are committed to fixing things fast. There are always patchs after patchs in MMO's it's to be expected. 
 <br> 
 <br> I will be happy if 75% of all the content works effectively. 
 <br> 
 <br> SWG maybe had 50 or 40% working effectively and look how well it did. 
 <br> 
 <br> Will it fail. I don't think so too big a market for it and sales alone will make it sucessful.

				<i>I am surprised that this thread didn't turn into a love fest for Blizzard.</i>
 <br> 
 <br> I think we're all excited about the game, and hopeful that it will deliver on the promise of it's potential but, as gamers, we can't afford to be unrealistic.
 <br> 
 <br> Most of us have been let down enough times before that we know better than to always assume the best.

				It's the same as other MMORPG? How much exactly can you change without changing the genre. Also, while World of Warcraft is similar to other MMORPG's it definatley will not be the same. I have never played a MMORPG where I could explore all of the great places I can in WoW.

				EQ was/is a smashing success.  Whether or not it's a great game, or even a good game, is up for debate.
 <br> 
 <br> Ultimately, what makes a game good is subscriptions.  Quality can be laking, as I feel EQ is, but it holds the most subscriptions, for the longest time.  That makes it a success, despite the fact i find it nearly mind numbingly boring.
 <br> 
 <br> Which is also why we get all the EQ clones out there.  Why tamper with a forumla that has proven itself to draw a massive amount of money each month?  So we get a lot of repeat crap, with slight variations, because it makes the people money.
 <br> 
 <br> Blizzard hopefully will bring something new to the game, with the quality they've had in all their previous games.  I think blizzard will have a &quot;successful&quot; game, based off of sheer numbers.  They will have the same success as EQ - subscriptions.
 <br> 
 <br> I also believe that based off of their quality, it will be a good game content and gameplay wise.  But ultimately that's not what is considered success in this industry. =/

				Something I've noticed about MMORPGs is that, aside from the first big 3 (UO, EQ, &amp; AC)
 <br> -------------------------------------------------------
 <br> 
 <br> &lt;snickers&gt; AC was 1 of the big 3???? &lt;ROFLMAO, sorry but read that and just had to comment as thats absolutly hillarious to see someone try to claim&gt;.
 <br> 
 <br> Quinas, 
 <br> 
 <br> your right about the move from UO to EQ about the general feelings but here is the catch. EQ did in fact improve MMORPGs and raise the Bar over UO. Sure there was issues (and still is) but EQ was in fact heads and tails above anything UO could offer (other then unchecked PKing and exploiting).
 <br> 
 <br> DAoC was heads above EQ IMO. Wasnt as popular but definatly was more involved. EQs biggest claim to fame in todays market is just the sheer size of it (which like or hate EQ, its a real accomplishment).
 <br> 
 <br> There is a small chance WOW will suck, but based on history the game should be better just by rights of evolution. Add into that fact that Blizzard has far more experience (in terms of successes) in game creation (MMORPG, Multiplayer, or single player) then Mythic, Verrant, or Origin combined when they released their products at first and you have a solid stance to base hopes on.
 <br> 
 <br> Yes, WoW is going to make some mistakes. Many of the mistakes will not actually be mistakes but items that dont appeal to this or that faction of players. In the end tho, as long as Blizzard doesnt get to big a ego (IE: become Origin or Verrant) the chances of failure are minimual at worst.
 <br> =======================================================
 <br> 
 <br> As for the history of games and what they brought or how they impacted in North American MMORPG markets. (many many games not mentioned as they flat out failed to impact market what so ever. Liniage not mentioned as its impact is in Korea at the moment not North America)
 <br> 
 <br> Original NWN (on AOL): first graphical online persistant world game to grasp a wide variety of players imagination. Huge following (huge relation to actual population) for PvP (consentual) players. Max population was 200 for most of time and 500 for last year in release. Zoned PvP to avoid unconsentual PKing.
 <br> 
 <br> The Realms (Seirra): Grand Father version of what DAoC is today. First game to offer player housing. Zoned PvP to avoid unconsentual PKing.
 <br> 
 <br> Dark Sun Online : Definatly a step backwards from NWN and The Realms. Main draw was the popular Dark Sun AD&amp;D world. Poor interface and combat. First MMORP game to have tasks or merchant style quests intensive. Zoned PvP to avoid unconsentual PKing.
 <br> 
 <br> Meridian 59: Terrible game but the birth of PKers for all intensive purposes. Succesful following for its time but never achieving the numbers maintained by NwN or The Realms in their day.
 <br> 
 <br> Utlima Online: The first MASSIVE multiplayer online role playing game. Contrary to popular myth, Ultima only truely created one aspect of gaming...trade crafts. It did how ever expand on all aspects previously created by its fore fathers. Houseing: Huge and still best over all to date. Crafting: set the market standard not to be rivaled for many years. PKing: Absolute unchecked chaos over shadowing any good aspects of game. Bugs: Quite possibly the most bugs of any release to date and after of any product. Population levels: Unheard of Population numbers for its time more then doubleing previous game population numbers.
 <br> 
 <br> NOTE: Unchecked PKing is the main and number one reason UO lost so many players when EQ started. Proving unchecked PKing does NOT sell the the main market of players. Unpunished exploiting and hacking became a very close 2nd as reason for leaving.
 <br> 
 <br> Double note: UO set the standard for the poor customer service found in todays online games.
 <br> 
 <br> EQ: Market standard for all MMORPG games to date. Definatly the most popular North American game ever released. Flag PvP system while fundamentally flawed was a huge huge huge improvement over the unchecked PKing of UO. Communication in game was superb. EQ had many faults but in the end they basically created a game that was fundamentally &quot;better&quot; then any aspect previously offered in any MMORPG other then crafting and Housing&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> NOTE: EQ lowered the standard even more by limiting the Customer service hours of operation outside of game but not allowing in game &quot;GMs&quot; to have ability to fix problems.
 <br> 
 <br> AC: Not much really can be said about AC, It didnt raise or improve the bar over anything offered in EQ or UO. It lowered the bar in customer service (or lack of). About the only different aspect it offered was a changing in game storyline (even this idea was nothing new and had been used to basically same results in DSO). 
 <br> 
 <br> AO: First real attempt into Sci Fi style MMORPG. Not a huge hit but first attempt at something outside of Fantasy.
 <br> 
 <br> DAoC: DAoC raised the bar again incorperating Massive PvE popularized in EQ with consentual area PvP originated in NwN on AOL and The Realms. Raised the bar in crafting from UO to modern times. First TRUE army warfare MMORPG created. Recreated houseing in MMORPG by reintroducing a seperate housing zone (as used originally in &quot;The Realms&quot;, eliminating the lag issues during combat that accompanies UO housing to this day.
 <br>  
 <br> Note: Improved Customer service slightly from EQ and UO mostly through lip service rather then hands on helping.
 <br> 
 <br> Shadowbane: Attempted but ultimately failed attempt to reinvent PK style MMORPGs. Proving once and for all unchecked PKing is only popular to a small minority of players online.
 <br> 
 <br> Star Wars Online: Newest of the Star Wars products. Flawed game in keeping with most Star Wars related software games. Definatly raised the bar over AO sci-fi. Didnt really introduce anything new.
 <br> 
 <br> World of Warcraft: Its impact on market still pending.

				So now you need to ask those same questions of EQII. 
 <br> 
 <br> Actually of any game for that matter. 
 <br> 
 <br> I think a better question is 'will WoW live up to my expectations?'
 <br> 
 <br> Like EQII, I personally think WoW won't &quot;fail&quot;, at least in from a money point of view. I'm sure plenty of fans will flock to both to make them earn money.
 <br> 
 <br> It would take some serious mismanagement to screw things up.

				in your post you are already aware of this situation. any new mmorpg game will have a chance of failing. WoW will be no different.
 <br> 
 <br> the only really good news out of this is, with all the new mmorpg games comming out, the competion will be tough specially in holding thier customer fanbase. if WOW is a success (where everything is good from content to gameplay), EQ, DOAC, and AC will lose lots of players. if Darkfall is a success (same good in all aspect of the game), SB, SWG (pvpers), Darktide (AC1), EQ (pvpers), UO, and other pvp servers will lose a lot of players (including WOW pvpers). this is the nature of the beast of gamming, mmorpg is no different. 
 <br> 
 <br> problem is which mmorpg company will release a really good game. past one or two years no mmorpg games offered any reasons for them to leave the games they are playing (most players I meet are just playing thier present game because there is really no good game out there. this are players from EQ to SWG). maybe WOW will answer this. will see though when beta started (since there is no NDA will find out fast if the gameplay is good. I won't be surprised if they suddenly subjected beta testers to NDA if game have too many negatives).

				I dunno, I saw all the other MMORPG's approaching: SWG, Eve, Shadowbane, Horizons, etc., and I saw flaws in each one of them before they were released that made me want to avoid them altogether -- and thankfully I did.  World of Warcraft is the first game that doesn't give me those negative vibes.  That doesn't mean I'll be correct, it just causes me to act a bit more fanboish about this one.

				WoW = hype because it's made by Blizzard
 <br> 
 <br> That's all it is, even though the Warcraft fanbois won't admit to it.  
 <br> 
 <br> I don't know personally.. but my friend said it will be just like Asheron's Call 2.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> I know soooooo many people who are getting WoW just for the fact that its made by blizzard... they have no idea what MMORPGs are like, they don't care.

				Well there definitly is already a loyal fanbase and EXTREMELY high amounts of hype.
 <br> 
 <br> I mean when u get nearly as many beta applications as there are players in the top selling mmorpgs u definitly know ppl are anticipating it.  If they will be satisfied, only time can tell but after release it WILL sell and with that many people even if the game sucks there are bound to be a good amount who stick with it.  I mean how can a game like shadowbane still exist?  I played the beta for it and it was horrible.  I mean the game was hacked into and messed up real bad, but it still has running servers with a player base.

				For sure many people will be disappointed with WoW. You just have to look at these forums to see how many different people are lobbying/wishing/begging for it to be a specific type of game that appeals to them. PvP based. No PvP at all. Like EQ. Not like EQ. Like DAoC. Not like DAoC. The list goes on, and there is no way they will all be happy with whatever the game winds up being.
 <br> 
 <br> But in the end the game will succeed or not based on how fun it is to play - whatever form that takes. Every game has pre-hype accompanied by people that think it will be the next thing and others who don't. The problem that many recent games that wore that tag like AC2, SWG and a few others is that not only did they not really please everyone - which is impossible - they were not when the dust settled all that fun or all that engaging to play.

				&quot; AC: Not much really can be said about AC, It didnt raise or improve the bar over anything offered in EQ or UO. It lowered the bar in customer service (or lack of). About the only different aspect it offered was a changing in game storyline (even this idea was nothing new and had been used to basically same results in DSO). &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Oh really? What do you call monthly updates? Free content every single month. EQ didn't offer it, UO didn't offer it. What kind of stuff you ask came in those updates? Stuff UO and EQ would have passed off as a expansion.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot; DAoC: DAoC raised the bar again incorperating Massive PvE popularized in EQ with consentual area PvP originated in NwN on AOL and The Realms. Raised the bar in crafting from UO to modern times. First TRUE army warfare MMORPG created. Recreated houseing in MMORPG by reintroducing a seperate housing zone (as used originally in &quot;The Realms&quot;, eliminating the lag issues during combat that accompanies UO housing to this day. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I agree with everything here except for the DAoC raised the bar crap. That is the biggest load of crap I have ever heard. DAoC's crafting system was horribly boreing and tedious. UO had a 10x better crafting system. I could go around killing cows and deer for hours to skin them for the leather for my tailor. Not to mention my smithy house right near a mountain with a ton of ore. If anything DAoC lowered the standard and WoW will be raising it again.

				I think calling EQ or DAOC a failure is just.... wrong.  Those games have been and are wildly sucessfull.
 <br> And DAOC does offer its own unique style of PvP combat, which I LOVE.  They might not have raised the bar on crafting, but they definetely went the distance with their RvR zones and concepts.
 <br> WOW will hopefully be playable enough to offer us the next candy to pacify the masses.  Sure, not everyone will be happy with it, but I dont think thats the goal for a gaming company.

				All MMORPG's, by nature, have more things in common than they don't. Lets face it, this genre is full of conventions that make it what it is. Changing these staple fundamentals is dangerous to the potential of the game in question. That said, I am NOT expecting WoW to be dramatically different from any other MMORPG. What I AM expecting, is for Blizzard to refine the standard conventions into something more entertaining. Every single MMORPG has done something right, in some cases several somethings. The key to making a successful game is to get as many things right as possible. Rather than trying to make a fntasy-based MMORPG from all original concepts, I think Blizzard is looking to refine existing concepts and put their own unique twist on a few more. That is what I am hoping for, nothing more, nothing less.
 <br> 
 <br> Could WoW fail? Of course it could, it could turn out to be the most pathetic MMORPG ever produced. It could make Horizons, Shadowbane and AC2 into success stories. While all this is certainly possible, I don't think this will be the case. Blizzard is building on an already highly successful RTS franchise. They have a legion of Diablo and Starcraft fans that are most likely going to try the game out based upon prior experience with these games. The stage is set for a fairly large initial influx of players. Blizzard has made several addicting games already, if this one is even just as good as every other MMORPG (does not even have to be better) then it will be a rather large success. Will it dominate EQ, DAoC, SWG as well as EQ2 and Lineage 2? Time will tell. There is just as much chance it will as there are that it will fail. My money says it will at least be one of the Big 3.

 <br> I seriously hope they have extra servers set up for regrestration for the first week, or their WoW general boards will go down the crapper even further than they are atm.
 <br> 
 <br> One good thing is that when the game comes out not everyone (ie the 13 year olds who make up the majority of the Blizzard boards who need to beg their parents for the money) won't get the game for a while.

				&quot; All MMORPG's, by nature, have more things in common than they don't. Lets face it, this genre is full of conventions that make it what it is. Changing these staple fundamentals is dangerous to the potential of the game in question. That said, I am NOT expecting WoW to be dramatically different from any other MMORPG. What I AM expecting, is for Blizzard to refine the standard conventions into something more entertaining. Every single MMORPG has done something right, in some cases several somethings. The key to making a successful game is to get as many things right as possible. Rather than trying to make a fntasy-based MMORPG from all original concepts, I think Blizzard is looking to refine existing concepts and put their own unique twist on a few more. That is what I am hoping for, nothing more, nothing less. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Pretty much what I was trying to say in my original post. Thanks for the better explanation. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916025426im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/1.gif" border="0" alt="happy" hspace="0" vspace="0">
