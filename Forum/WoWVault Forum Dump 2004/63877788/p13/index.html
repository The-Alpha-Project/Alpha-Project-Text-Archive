				what should happen when you die?
 <br> 
 <br> if your answer is nothing then you support no death penalty (might as well take death out of the game)
 <br> 
 <br> if anything occurs to the player upon death which impacts the player such as:
 <br> respawn at a bind spot
 <br> loss of items
 <br> lost of exp
 <br> vitae or temporary stat loss
 <br> even if you die and respawn exactly at the same spot
 <br> or see a death animation
 <br> or your character falls to the ground
 <br> then you support a death penalty.

				The question was WHY have a DP?
 <br> 
 <br> What does a DP serve for you?

 <br> 
 <br> I don't feel that dieing and respawning back at a bindpoint is a death penalty (unless you are not given an option to do it voluntarily ala AC1).

 <br> 
 <br> How do you not understand this?
 <br> 
 <br> Deleveling is a Death Penalty and is controlled solely by the developers. If they decide they do not wish this in thier game they do so for thier own reasons that have nothing to do with the above statement.

				Going to address the last quote first: 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I don't feel that dieing and respawning back at a bindpoint is a death penalty&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> (1) It is &quot;dying&quot;. Sorry, just tired of you misspelling the word. 
 <br> 
 <br> (2) I consider it a penalty - especially if the game uses respawning like EQ does (your items stay on your corpse). 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Now, to these two: 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Why have a Death Penalty?&quot; &amp; &quot;What does a DP serve for you?&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> This has been answered many, many, MANY times in this thread. 
 <br> 
 <br> For most people, it is the key ingredient in  balancing risk vs reward, which makes the fight personally satisfying to them. For a lot of people, it adds to the thrill of the fight, knowing they have more at stake should they lose - it becomes an additional excitement factor that they like to have in their games, because they play games for fun and excitement. 
 <br> 
 <br> It is also punitive, designed to discourage people from recklessly attacking content that they cannot win against. It is designed to cause players to play more carefully, to put more thought into their strategy and tactics, and to think more carefully about what mobs they attack. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> There have been arguments against all of these: 
 <br> 
 <br> Some people don't feel they need a punishment, that the failure of not winning the fight is enough for them. 
 <br> 
 <br> Some people feel that it is a GAME, and as such they want their entertainment to be as far removed from adverse penalties as possible. They suffer enough in real life, they play games to have fun - a positive experience all the time, every time.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> The thing I get out of this thread is that people who dislike death penalties generally seem to dislike negative experience of any kind in their games. They play games to ALWAYS have fun, and any kind of adversity in a game is frowned upon by them. I can totally understand this rational. If that is what works for you, if that is how you prefer to have your games created, good for you. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> The other thing I get out of this thread is that people who support death penalties enjoy overcoming odds, obstacles, etc, and they generally enjoy the added thrill-excitement from &quot;cheating death&quot;, so to speak. They seem to prefer their games to more closely emulate real life - and for them not every gaming experience (individual sit-down play-period) *needs* to be a positive experience. They are people who are perfectly willng to accept the consequences of failure and any punishments that the developers choose to associate with it. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> It is, at the very basic level, a tale of two different breeds of game players. 
 <br> 
 <br> And what we have here is a difference of opinion on why death penalties are important, and necessary (or unnecessary, depending on your camp). 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Two different opinions. They cannot be reconciled. Live with it.

				Have to agree with Shara on this.
 <br> 
 <br> DP's are for people who don't like to have things handed to them. People that like to earn things, feel proud of thier accomplishments, and are usually competitive in natuer either with in themselves or with others.
 <br> 
 <br> The general gist of what is being said here is that people who don't want death penalties typically want to just experience a game and not have to worry about how many times it took them to defeat something. 
 <br> 
 <br> Some notes:
 <br> 
 <br> I don't really think I have played any games that do not force a penalty to some degree on the player. If they lack an experience system to take experience from players they usually force them to start from scratch or revert to a &quot;safe&quot; zone. 
 <br> I don't know about you but I would rather take an xp death keep what I have and move on rather then lose everything I have worked for and have to start way back at a fall back position.

				&quot;(1) It is &quot;dying&quot;. Sorry, just tired of you misspelling the word&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** TY for the correction.  I'm sure you can find many more misspellings in my posts.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;(2) I consider it a penalty &quot; (refering to Death itself)
 <br> 
 <br> *** I don't consider death as a Penalty because it is what it is.  Death is death.  It is the failure of accomplishing the objective (Added: Of course running away is a failure too but hopefully my point is understood).  Anything in addition to Death would be the penalty.  (Added: Or rather the added penalty that I mention further down.)
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;This has been answered many, many, MANY times in this thread.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** I asked these questions plain and simple b/c this thread has gone all over the place and I wanted everyone's thoughts regarding DP in a simple, easily to understand format w/o all the other jibberish that has been posted many, many, many times in this thread.
 <br> You answered it perfectly.  Thank you again.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;For most people, it is the key ingredient in balancing risk vs reward, which makes the fight personally satisfying to them. For a lot of people, it adds to the thrill of the fight, knowing they have more at stake should they lose - it becomes an additional excitement factor that they like to have in their games, because they play games for fun and excitement.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** Both good reasons FOR a DP.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;It is also punitive, designed to discourage people from recklessly attacking content that they cannot win against. It is designed to cause players to play more carefully, to put more thought into their strategy and tactics, and to think more carefully about what mobs they attack.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** My oppinion is this is not a good reason.  Players should be able to play how they like and take whatever risks they want to take w/o a negative penalty associated with it.  Basically, there should not be a penalty to discourage a particular style of play.
 <br> 
 <br> *** Also, if I know the risk of dying is great for a particular encounter I will already what you have said, &quot;play more carefully, to put more thought into their strategy and tactics, and to think more carefully about what mobs they attack.&quot;  I don't need a DP for me to understand I need to &quot;play this carefully&quot; to succeed.  If I don't then I die and thus I am unable to accomplish my objective.  Why should I also be penalized for not being able to accomplish my objective?  That is a double negative.  Do we play games so we can be penalized twice?  Is that considered fun?
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Some people feel that it is a GAME, and as such they want their entertainment to be as far removed from adverse penalties as possible. They suffer enough in real life, they play games to have fun - a positive experience all the time, every time.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** Agreed to an extent.  Positive experiences are good for games although any reasonable person knows they can't happen every time.  After all, the game has to end sometime.  Also, I'm not so sure people play games becuase they suffer IRL but that's a different subject.  =P
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;people who support death penalties enjoy overcoming odds, obstacles, etc, and they generally enjoy the added thrill-excitement from &quot;cheating death&quot;, so to speak.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** I can say the same thing for people that dislike DPs.  I'm a prime example.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;They seem to prefer their games to more closely emulate real life - and for them not every gaming experience (individual sit-down play-period) *needs* to be a positive experience. They are people who are perfectly willng to accept the consequences of failure and any punishments that the developers choose to associate with it.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** Well, when we die in RL we do loose everything.  Just wish I would be able to come back at a bindstone.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040916025810im_/http://media.ign.com/boardfaces/2.gif" border="0" alt="sad" hspace="0" vspace="0">   Also, for those of us that dislike DPs never said they don't like Death in MMOs and I'm prety sure that is not considered a positive experience.  We just don't think we should be penalized twice for our failures.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;It is, at the very basic level, a tale of two different breeds of game players. 
 <br> .....
 <br> Two different opinions. They cannot be reconciled. Live with it.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** Yes, it is two different opinions, and I enjoy reading opposing oppinions from mine.  I like to see what other gamers like and dislike.  I for one am certainly able to live with it.  After all, I'm not the one who gets upset over other people's posts.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br>

				&quot;DP's are for people who don't like to have things handed to them. People that like to earn things, feel proud of thier accomplishments, and are usually competitive in natuer either with in themselves or with others.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** Like I said in reply to Shara's post, people who dislike DPs feel the same way.  I'm very competitive and am proud of my accomplishments and if everything is handed to me in a game then don't expect me to play it long b/c it is to easy and boring.  Just because a game may not have DPs doesn't mean it will automatically be a cake walk.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;The general gist of what is being said here is that people who don't want death penalties typically want to just experience a game and not have to worry about how many times it took them to defeat something.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** Agree.  I for one want to experience the game, but like I said above don't want to be penalized twice for not succeeding.  If I am unable to kill a mob or accomplish a task after a few (2-3) goes at it then I will hold of on doing it till I am an approriate enough level/strength.  If a player want's to keep trying to accomplish that task regardless of how long it takes or how many attempts then that person should be able to.  I find it a waste of time, but I don't think there should be game mechanics that try and force a particular playstyle.
 <br> ______________________________________________________
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;I don't know about you but I would rather take an xp death keep what I have and move on rather then lose everything I have worked for and have to start way back at a fall back position.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> *** I don't mind either as long as it's not to harsh.  Don't think I'm being hypocritcal by saying this.  I'm being open to other player's desires.  I totally agree with the end of that statement and I feel that any loss of equipment, deleveling, or harsh experience loss (those that take hours to recoop) is just that.
 <br> 
 <br> *** TY for your remarks Baloria.  Lot's of good stuff from everyone.

				I think with all the convoluted conversations that are going we are starting to miss the real point once again.
 <br> 
 <br> Death Penalties are not for individuals. They are for the General populace.
 <br> 
 <br> Individuals are great and can measure thier success in proper means such as defeating an encounter in one go and wanting to keep thier pride.
 <br> 
 <br> The problem is that the genreal public doesn't follow this regard. The general populace is happy throwing themselves constantly at an encounter that is to high for thier level and die repeatedly until they succeed. If it means they take no penalty and get all the reward. 
 <br> 
 <br> Here is an example:
 <br> 
 <br> With no death penalty you can fight that Monster who is 5 levels higher then you and if you die you just have to get back to the monster. So you start the fight and died and then come back and die and finally on your 8th try you defeat that monster. Now you get that reward. That reward being an item that is above your level. You now use that item to kill things your level with incredibly ease and your net loss is only the small amount of time it took you defeat that monster but your net gain is the loot and xp from that monster and an item that will increase you ability to level by a tremendous amount.
 <br> 
 <br> Here is another example:
 <br> 
 <br> Ok we are fighting the team of 8 monsters all above our level. If one character can keep them busy we can all kill them. That one character who is keeping them busy will die everytime though. However, because you have 2 people who are willing to do it and the reward is imensly higher then normal it is faster then going through the game the way it was intended. So you kill 1 person every encounter switching in between and you level much faster then your supposed and only two member of the party lag slightly behind but are still doing better then they would have normally.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> One thing about the whole double negative situation.
 <br> 
 <br> If we are so great and wonderful. Our ethics comeplete screwed on. Then why do we need a double positive when a positive all ready exists for completing a situation? The truth is that succeeding and failing are results and are only positive or negative as they relate to the invidual situation. Generally speaking Death is a negative, but it is not all ways so. As in my above examples. Just as winning is not all ways a positive thing. Winning an encounter may result in a negative effect on the player by having to leave his group because he has become to poweful, missing out on content because of leveling, recieving the reward only to find out because of the challenge you chose and won you can not go back the other way in which your friends went, and you wish you had died in that encounter. 
 <br> Its all relative to situation and person. There are all ways exceptions to the rule, and the systems are designed to cover as many exceptions as possible in the broadest possible way.

				A DP could prevent both of your examples from happening or at least deter them.  
 <br> 
 <br> However, there are other methods a designer can use other than a DP to prevent the 1st example of occuring such as level restrictions on items (which WoW has -- and I know EQ doesn't or didn't have for a long time).
 <br> 
 <br> As for your second example, sometimes an encounter is made for one or more people to be suicidal lambs so to say.  Look at DAoC, many if not most of the high level encounters can only be accomplished this way unless you have a massive zerg of players (and even with the Hib Dragon you can expect to die many times over).  One thing I hate about DAoC and I hope WoW does not emulate.  It's terrible that a game maker would make harsh DPs then make encounters where the only way you can succeed is if part of your party dies while attempting it.

				CAnk
 <br> Totally agree. In EQ with high level content you had clerics around that had 100% XP rezzes so you never suffered the loss you did in DAOC. This was the main idea behind those rezzes. The heavy XP loss had to be offset because of certain encounters resulting in higher death tolls.
 <br> 
 <br> Also alot of those encounters though not all can be done with less people and no loss of life. Alot of the time its about pushing the envelope which most people just don't want to do. So my point is even more valid when you look at the fact that people are even willing to suffer XP deaths to get what they want if the reward is valid. With out the XP deaths you would be willing to do these tactics more often and for more situations instead of learning how to really complete the trials. 
 <br> 
 <br> Thron1
 <br> 
 <br> You really have to be kidding me. 
 <br> 
 <br> Personally I don't cheat myself in what I do. I do it with pride no matter how small the task. I do my best to give it the same passion and pride as everything else I do.
 <br> 
 <br> Applying different levels of ethics to things you do is selling yourself short. IF you do something or have a beleif in something apply it to everything and not just to whats convient or you think makes sense.
 <br> 
 <br> Its like a good Sensei will tell his students. The things you learn in the dojo are easy to use in the dojo, but applying them to life is more difficult and more rewarding.

 <br> 
 <br> Heh so you want to have stuff handed to you in a game?  Wheres the FUN in that?  The reason everyone plays games is to have fun... What your saying is that only accomplishments in life matter.  This is only half true.  Why get a degree? To get a better job, increase your knowledge, etc.  Why have a challenging game?  To have fun, yes thats right fun.  Why should a game be easy just because life is not?  Games are made fun because they are challenging, and you can't actually lose anything (except the monthly fee/cost of the game and time) that you did not have in the first place.  Again people play games for fun.  Easy &lt;&gt; Fun, Challenging CAN = Fun, you just have to find the right challenge (ie you might like tetris more than a FPS that dosen't make it less fun to you does it?)
 <br> 
 <br> &lt;&lt;sorry but when real people start to lose their grip on reality over a game, well, just makes me a bit worried for them&gt;&gt;

				For my money, I would prefer a system of die-and-wait-for-a-rez or respawn-at-bind-with-all-gear-and-permanent-xp-loss (or debt.)  If I'm grouped, and there is someone in the group who can rez, then I can wait for the rez and be back in business.  If not, I can elect to respawn at my bind point with an xp loss (or xp debt if it would cause me to delevel, I think delevelling in MMORPGs is horrendous idea) that can only be earned back via adventuring.
 <br> 
 <br> With limited bind points (say everyone can only bind at towns/cities or special bind-points) this would present a significant enough penalty to discourage recklessness, but never place someone in a position where a significant investment of time or accumulation of gear is permanently lost. 
 <br> 
 <br> In games like EQ, starting over with nothing can effectively make the character somewhat to totally useless for their role.  A naked necromancer in EQ could probably fairly quickly be up and running, ditto for the naked beastlord or shaman.  Wizards and druids might be ok, but a limited mana pool is going to make kiting bigger mobs nearly impossible (gear provided a lot of mana) and so on.
 <br> 
 <br> If gear is as important in WoW as it is in EQLive, then the death penalty should be harsh in terms of lost time, or even temporarily weakened attributes, but never with the need for a corpse-run to recover your gear.

 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Wow this made 13 pages geez big issue.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> 26 pages.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Heh so you want to have stuff handed to you in a game?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> I thought that we established that penalty != challenge of a fight?  Or the chance to win or lose?  A challenge can be extremely difficult without applying penalties for failure -- and it can be rewarded accordingly.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;... as opposed to not real people?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Yes, Brother Maynard in Prydwen keep is not a real person.  He does not truly gain when you pay him to heal your constitution.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;DP's are for people who don't like to have things handed to them. People that like to earn things, feel proud of thier accomplishments, and are usually competitive in natuer either with in themselves or with others. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> In my opinion, DPs are for masochistic people that have a weak personal capability to value their own achievements, and have poor self-motivation (or believe others have poor self-motivation, usually a reflection of themselves) to try for success.  They also feel a sense of satisfaction by being &quot;better&quot; than others -- being able to take more &quot;pain&quot; before they /cancel.  They feel the whip is more effective than the prize.  Last, they forget that games are meant to be a win-win.
 <br> 
 <br> Game:
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;An activity providing entertainment or amusement; a pastime:&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Provide punishment?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;A competitive activity or sport in which players contend with each other according to a set of rules:&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Within the scope of the challenge (one round, one game, one tournament).
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;A period of competition or challenge&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Punishment?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;A particular style or manner of playing a game: improved my tennis game with practice.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Still looking for &quot;penalties&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;An active interest or pursuit, especially one involving competitive engagement or adherence to rules:&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;A model of a competitive situation that identifies interested parties and stipulates rules governing all aspects of the competition, used in game theory to determine the optimal course of action for an interested party.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Oh here's a concrete one, still don't see punishments.
 <br> 
 <br> The best argument for DPs is that the entire life of the character is a single challenge.  However, that is only true if that is the intended gameplay:
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;role-playing game
 <br> n. 
 <br> A game in which players assume the roles of characters and act out fantastical adventures, the outcomes of which are partially determined by chance, as by the roll of dice.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Special notice to the &quot;assume the roles of characters&quot; and &quot;act out fantastical adventures&quot;, and how this contrasts with &quot;watch the blue bar go up&quot; and &quot;watch the character get +1 on their character sheet&quot;.
 <br> 
 <br> Adherence to this paradigm insists that character progression is not &quot;saved&quot; at level demarcations.  To treat the entire life of the character as a single challenge means that &quot;de-leveling&quot; is possible.  To treat the game as an RPG, the characters should be able to &quot;save&quot; at a minimum of between each discrete challenge.  /shrug

				&quot;You are not your avatar. You ROLE PLAY a CHARACTER who is represented by your avatar. 
 <br> 
 <br> You don't seem to grasp this concept. YOU have absolutely nothing to do with your characters state of being. Your characters state of being is determined by the forces that reside in the Fictional universe. 
 <br> 
 <br> What you are saying is the same as saying, well I don't see why my character should die because well I didn't die when he got that long sword stuck in his cut. What happens to your character happens to him not YOU. You are along for the ride, and to have fun trying to LIVE THROUGH and not AS the character. &quot;
 <br> 
 <br> It adds so much fun and value to my gametime to re-live my character through the same set of X experiences 5 times.
 <br> 
 <br> Hmm wait, no, I already lived through my character clearing out Spindelhalla 87 times.  Dying and then having to live through my character clearing out Spindelhalla an additional 2 times (because of the death) is ... so ... fun.
 <br> 
 <br> Because I forgot what it was like the first 87 times right?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;XP = Class Level 
 <br> 
 <br> Class Level = level of skill in chosen vocation 
 <br> 
 <br> How do you not understand this? 
 <br> 
 <br> Deleveling is a Death Penalty and is controlled solely by the developers. If they decide they do not wish this in thier game they do so for thier own reasons that have nothing to do with the above statement.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Same deal, if their level of skill in their chosen vocation (despite the fact that exp is acquired for many activities beyond directly practicing their chosen vocation), then why not have de-leveling?  Why is it so unpopular, if that is the actual meaning behind experience points?
 <br> 
 <br> You mean those people don't mind having their gametime taken away, but they do get pissed when they have 1 pt of Str taken away?  Hrm.  &quot;Cognitive dissonance&quot;?

				&quot;Nimbus - you clearly wanted a particular style of gameplay out of your game.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Actually, I sat there thinking &quot;why does DAOC feel *wrong*, and why are people I know pissed at PvE?&quot;  And &quot;why do I hate the exp penalty?&quot;  If I hate it, then why does the game include it?
 <br> 
 <br> I looked to all other games and said &quot;what are the abstract basics?&quot;  And my answer is somewhere in the last 26 pages ^_^.
 <br> 
 <br> So the particular style of gameplay I want is the same basic style of gameplay found in other activities titled &quot;games&quot;.  There is a basic commonality in all games -- a system of challenges with a reward for success and no penalties for failure beyond the scope of the particular challenge.  Action in the system costs the player time and effort.
 <br> 
 <br> This is probably why, IMO, people end up referring to EQ as a &quot;career&quot; and such.  Why people sometimes do the same for their level 50+s in DAOC.  What leads them to do that really?
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Then come back here and read what your typing. Arguing a point just for arguments sake is a waste of time.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Nay, arguing a point just for argument's sake is the objective of the VN Boards.  Ye shall learn one day, and then ye shall be known as a true VN Warrior.  Until that day, keep up thy practice young Padawan.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> &quot;Also alot of those encounters though not all can be done with less people and no loss of life. Alot of the time its about pushing the envelope which most people just don't want to do. So my point is even more valid when you look at the fact that people are even willing to suffer XP deaths to get what they want if the reward is valid. With out the XP deaths you would be willing to do these tactics more often and for more situations instead of learning how to really complete the trials.&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> Edit: It's funny.  EQ put in the extreme rezzes just so that the players could take on the challenges.  Without the exp penalty, the extreme rezzes would not be necessary and:
 <br> 
 <br> By the same token, without exp deaths you can create more challenging encounters and push the envelope even farther without having to implement 100%/near-100% rezzes to mitigate the penalties.
 <br> 
 <br> You CAN kill a hyper-charged Lu Bu as an untrained CAW.  You'll die 20 times in a row (minimum for a very skilled person) and you will have to kite and run around half the map, but you can do it ^_^.  2 mistakes and you die, 150 hits and he's dead.  He also has a much greater range and arc, doesn't get stunned by your hits, blocks after the first hit, can break through your guard with T1, and runs faster than you to boot.
