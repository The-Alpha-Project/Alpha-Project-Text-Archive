 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">What is World of Warcraft?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> World of Warcraft is an MMORPG game based on the Warcraft universe from the Warcraft RTS games.  The game is being developed and produced by Blizzard Entertainment.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">When will the beta start?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> Beta signups are now closed.  Beta is scheduled to begin very soon.  Blizzard will be announcing when they send out beta acceptance emails.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">How will we know when beta emails have been sent out?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> Blizzard will be announcing when they send the emails out.  If Blizzard hasn't announced anything and people claim to be receiving beta emails, they are probably joking.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">When will the game be released?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> Blizzard has not yet stated a target release date.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">What playable races are in World of Warcraft?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> At release, the playable races will be Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, Night Elves, Orcs, Undead, Tauren, and Trolls.  For more specific information, check <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040412211009/http://wowvault.ign.com/">WoW Vault</a> or the <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040412211009/http://www.blizzard.com/wow">Official Site</a>.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">What classes will be available?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> The following classes will be available at release: Mage, Warrior, Priest, Paladin, Shaman, Warlock, Rogue, Druid, and Hunter.  For more specific information, check <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040412211009/http://wowvault.ign.com/">WoW Vault</a> or the <a class="BoardRowBLink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040412211009/http://www.blizzard.com/wow">Official Site</a>.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">What sort of PvP will the game have?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> Currently very little is known about WoW's PvP.  PvP is consensual, meaning that you must agree to a duel (in arenas) or enter a PvP region (PvP regions make up about 10% of the world) in order to be attacked by another player.  There will be faction based combat and players will be able to fight NPCs and take over towns.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">What are the system requirements?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> The game is being developed for both Mac and PC.  Early reports indicate that the game will run smoothly on a P3 800 MHz with a low end graphics card, but that a higher end machine will be needed to take advantage of the game's graphical abilities.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: indigo;">Will there be a monthly fee?</span></span>
 <br> 
 <br> Yes.  The monthly fee will cover regular content updates made by Blizzard.  The exact amount has not yet been set, but the current going rate for MMORPGs seems to be about $12.95 - $15.95.

 <br> *** History *** 
 <br> The history of the Warcraft universe is long and rich. An entire FAQ could be dedicated to it alone, so I will only give it in brief here, and provide links to the extended versions. If you are not already familiar with the history behind this game, you should take the time to become so. It is an excellent read in its own right and will greatly improve your experience in World of Warcraft. 
 <br> 
 <br> 1. Demons are the force of chaos, and they dwell in the depths of the universe. 
 <br> 2. Titans are the benevolent gods who seek to order all things. 
 <br> 3. A titan named Saergas is assigned to stomp out the demons. 
 <br> 4. If you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you; Saergas goes mad and becomes evil. 
 <br> 5. Saergas enslaves the demons into an army he calls the Burning Legion. 
 <br> 
 <br> 6. Elves awake on Azeroth near the shores of a sea of magic. 
 <br> 7. They live by the sea and start practicing magic. 
 <br> 8. The Burning Legion notices the magic and becomes lustful for the sea of power. 
 <br> 9. Some elves are corrupted by the love for magic and become High Elves. 
 <br> 10. The High Elves come under the sway of Saergas and begin to summon him into the lake of magical power. 
 <br> 11. Two Elven brothers attempt to put an end to this. It appears to mean the destruction of the lake of power. 
 <br> 12. One of the brothers is too addicted to magic to destroy the lake. He secrets a vial of the lake. 
 <br> 13. In the battle to stop the summoning, everything is destroyed. Saergas, the lake of magical power, the Elven nation, and most of it's people. The face of Azeroth is remade. 
 <br> 14. What's left of the lake of magical power becomes the Maelstrom. 
 <br> 15. A few elves live through it, including the two brothers. They form a nation in the new land of Kalimdor. 
 <br> 16. The greedy brother survived and creates a new well of magical power with the sample stolen from the first. 
 <br> 18. The elves are split, some like the well of power and some don't. They ones who don't are exiled. They move to the far side of the world and are known as High Elves. 
 <br> 17. A nature god, Cenarius, and several demi-god dragons grow the World Tree over the well, bind the elves to the night and sway them to become druids. The night elves are created. 
 <br> 
 <br> 18. Much time passes. Dwarves, Humans, Goblins, Gnomes, Tauren, Trolls, etc all appear on Azeroth. 
 <br> 
 <br> 19. On another planet, the Burning Legion corrupts the leader of a shamanistic culture of nobile warriors to do their bidding. These are the Orcs. They are perverted to evil. 
 <br> 20. The Orcs open a dark portal to Azeroth and attack. 
 <br> 21. They loose. (this is highly abbreviated) 
 <br> 
 <br> 22. Back on the Orc homeworld, the Orc leader has second thoughts about serving the Burning Legion. He decides to lead his people to other planets by opening a bunch of world portals. To do so, he needs magical items. 
 <br> 23. The Orc leader stages several raids into Azeroth for these magical items. 
 <br> 24. The people of Azeroth think the Orcs mean to do them ill and counter attack. 
 <br> 25. The Human alliance leads an army into the Orc homeworld to put an end to them. 
 <br> 26. The Orc leader opens his portals. 
 <br> 27. The portals start to tear the Orc world apart. Oops! 
 <br> 28. The Orc leader runs for the exit. He exits into the homeland of the Burning Legion. Oops! 
 <br> 29. The Humans split back to Azeroth. 
 <br> 30. The Orc world is destroyed. 
 <br> 31. The Orcs on Azeroth are rounded up and put in camps. 
 <br> 
 <br> 32. The Orc leader is tortured by the Burning Legion. 
 <br> 33. The Burning Legion offer him a new body and an end to torture if he helps. He agrees. 
 <br> 34. The Orc leader's soul is put in a block of deep-space ice and sent to Azeroth. 
 <br> 35. The Orc leader's power is magnified a billion times by the Burning Legion and his spirit home in the ice. He 
 <br> becomes able to create undead and control them with his mind alone. He becomes the Lich King. 
 <br> 
 <br> 36. Back in Human lands, the Orcs start to get lazy and loose their will to fight. 
 <br> 37. It is decided that this is because they are feeling withdrawal from the Burning Legion. 
 <br> 38. One Orc is raised by humans and is called Thrall. 
 <br> 39. Thrall visits his people and is saddened. He tours all that is Orc left in Azeroth and is tutored by their best. He becomes a shaman and is appointed leader of all the Orc people. 
 <br> 40. Thrall heals the Orcs of their lament by bringing spirituality to them. He tries to free them. 
 <br> 
 <br> 41. The Lich King starts a death cult in Lordaeron. 
 <br> 
 <br> 42. The prince of the Human kingdom of Lordaeron, Lord Arthas, goes on a butt-stomping crusade to put an end to an apparent Orc uprising. 
 <br> 43. Arthas discovers pretty quick that there is a death cult in Lordaeron that is planning to poison the people and raise them as undead. 
 <br> 44. The cult succeeds. Arthas goes nutty about revenge. 
 <br> 45. Arthas performs various evil activities in his pursuit of revenge. 
 <br> 46. Arthas is warped by his lust for revenge and becomes evil. He becomes a Death Knight in, ironically, the service of the Lich King. 
 <br> 47. Arthas kills his father, the King of Lordaeron and destroys the kingdom. 
 <br> 48. Lordaeron becomes a nation of the dead. 
 <br> 49. The Lich King and his puppets, including Arthas, summon the Burning Legion into Azeroth. 
 <br> 
 <br> 50. Thrall and a small band of humans led by a wizard woman run for the hills! They flee to Kalimdor. 
 <br> 51. The Orcs ally with the local Tauren and Trolls. 
 <br> 52. Everyone on Azeroth decides that the Burning Legion has to go! They're wrecking everything! 
 <br> 53. The Burning Legion is defeated.

 <br>

 <br> 1. It has not started. It will start within weeks. 
 <br> 2. The signups are over. 
 <br> 3. A wide variety of systems will be accepted. 
 <br> 4. You have between a 2.5% and 3.7% chance to get in. 
 <br> 4. If you are accepted you will receive an email. 
 <br> 5. Blizzard will let us know when they send the letters.

 <br> 
 <br> *** Features *** 
 <br> 1. WoW is easy to learn and hard to master. 
 <br> 2. It is set in the amazing history that I poorly represented above. 
 <br> 3. There are thousands of quests, making it FAR more quest oriented than any other MMORPG. 
 <br> 4. The dungeons and some epic outdoors areas are 'instanced', meaning that when you enter them a private dungeon is created just for you and your group. 
 <br> 5. There is a diverse crafting implementation which provides some of the best items in the game without concern of item-creation failure. 
 <br> 6. You can gain experience just by exploring! 
 <br> 7. The game is fast-paced and focused on being fun, rather than a long, slow level grind. 
 <br> 
 <br> *** Races *** 
 <br> Alliance Races: Human, Dwarf, Night Elf, Gnome 
 <br> Horde Races: Orc, Troll, Tauren, Undead 
 <br> 
 <br> Note! Starting statistics for the races are not yet revealed. 
 <br> 
 <br> Abilities: 
 <br> 1. Undead do not have to breathe underwater, are resistant to shadow magic, and are immune to charm/sleep/fear spells. 
 <br> 2. Tauren have an ability called 'plains run', which lets them run cross-country at great speed. 
 <br> 3. Night Elves are resistant to nature, can 'shadowmeld', and find herbs. 
 <br> 4. Dwarves are resistant to frost, can mine minerals well, and can find treasure. 
 <br> 5. Gnomes are resistant to frost. 
 <br> 6. Humans get additional skill points. 
 <br> 7. Orc and Troll abilities are unknown or do not exist. 
 <br> 
 <br> *** Classes *** 
 <br> 1. Druid. Can heal and shapeshift. Night Elves and Tauren can be druids. 
 <br> 2. Hunter. Can tame and soothe beasts, track, dual wield and use ranged weapons. Dwarves, Night Elves, Orcs, 
 <br> Taurens, and Trolls can be hunters. 
 <br> 3. Mage. Can cast lots of magic. Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, and Undead can be mages. 
 <br> 4. Paladin. Can heal, cast 'seals', lay on hands, and a variety of other goody-two-shoes magic. They can also fight very well. Dwarves and Humans can be paladins. 
 <br> 5. Priest. Best healer. Dwarves, Humans, Night Elves, Trolls, and Undead can be priests. 
 <br> 6. Rogue. Can stealth, backstab, dual wield, and perform a variety of other cool, sneaky, high damage attacks. Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, Night Elves, Orcs, Trolls, and Undead can be rogues. 
 <br> 7. Shaman. Naturalist buffers, casters, and light warriors. Orcs, Tauren, and Trolls can be shamans. 
 <br> 8. Warlock. The summoner. Warlocks probably get the best pets, as they summon the Burning Legion. Gnomes, Humans, Orcs, and Undead can be warlocks. 
 <br> 9. Warriors. My favorite! Warriors can fight better than anyone. They have multiple stances and many neat attacks. Any race can be a warrior.

				THE HUGE AMOUNT OF INFO DELUGED TO US FROM ALPHA\BETA TESTERS IN THE FIRST Q&amp;A POST!
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: And I'm sorry, I really am, but I have to ask: Can you buffbot in WoW? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: It's hard to say, there isn't one class that has a dozen buffs to their arsenal. So it's not like Asheron's Call 1, where you would have a life mage casting 10 buff spells on your character.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;Do buffs have a range limit, a group restriction, or a time limit? That's really what I'm wondering. &quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> A: All buffs have a time restriction. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:&quot;What can you tell us about priests? 
 <br> 
 <br> I'm very interested in priests.. &quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A:Priests are the best healers in game, other then that your going to be more specific =) 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:&quot;What kind of leveling is in this game? Is it like FFXI where you're forced to group to make any meaningful exp, or is it like AC where you can actually make great progress solo, and team when you want for a little better exp?&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> A:Best way to level right now is grouping and doing quests.
 <br> 
 <br> Q:MAGES! 
 <br> 
 <br> A:I'm surprised by the interest in mages. what would you like to know about them? They have many range spells, like fireball or a frost attack. They have flamestrike, which scares the the pants off of you when you first see it  
 <br> 
 <br> Q:Do they get summons? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:It's believed they get water elemental at higher levels (past level 30), but we don't know 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:What about starting race stats, who has higher int, humans or gnomes? 
 <br> 
 <br> Hmm... Haven't payed attention much to those. However there are some obvious race benefits 
 <br> i.e. Humans get extra skill points at about lvl 15, I believe. +1 extra per level after that, which is a huge bonus 
 <br> Undead can breath under water, they are immnue to fear, sleep, and one other thing I can't recall at the moment 
 <br> Dwarves start with mining tradeskill for free 
 <br> which gives me the idea.. hey.. gnomes should start with engineering for free, it only seems fair, doesn't it? I'll have to /suggest that, when I can get back in
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:What kind of leveling is in this game? Is it like FFXI where you're forced to group to make any meaningful exp, or is it like AC where you can actually make great progress solo, and team when you want for a little better exp? 
 <br> 
 <br> How does the exp system work, is the exp cut in half for 2 people or is there some kind of bonus? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:I think, one hard transition from AC to this game, is the level of the monster. In AC, players are use to taking on monsters way above their level. In WoW, you can not. I'm was a 2 year player of AC, and I kept hitting my head against htat concept. 
 <br> 
 <br> If you are level 14 player in WoW, you will be dead even with a lvl 14 monster. Try to take on more than one lvl 14 by yourself, and it spells certain death. It looks like Blizzard adjusted that with the last patch though. With my rogue, I was taking on 2-3 monsters at a time. And with my warlock, I was able to do the same. (Both of these were the last two classes I was playing with.) 
 <br> 
 <br> In anycase, as you get higher in level, your progress by soloing, slows down. You can still do it, but it you can do it much faster by been grouped with someone.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Do you have to pick between frost skills or fire skills? Kind of like the skill tree in D2, or are you able to master in both, and not be any weaker? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:No, you can pick both. You don't spend skill points training in spells... you only spend money. So if you have the money, then you can buy it. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:&quot;If I were to play a Pally and decide to use a sword vs blunt weapons... Would there be a signifigent disadvantage? Like would I be able to do the same amount of damage with a sword as a hammer? 
 <br> 
 <br> If you were going hardcore and exping constantly, how long would it take to get to level 20? &quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: The only disadvantage would be you need to spend 2 skill points to get the sword option. ( 1 skill point per level) 
 <br> 
 <br> If you were hardcore exping constantly you would pass out in your vomit before you hit 20 =)
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:Any info on rogues would be much appreciated. 
 <br> 
 <br> How do they stack up against other classes in combat? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:Heh... rogues is the highest damage dealing class in the game. They are probably going to get nerfed  Fun though, mauling through monsters  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:Is dual wielding daggers the only reasonable way to go with them? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Dual wielding isn't a major modifier, especially not in the low levels of the skill. From what I've seen, you get some extra damage from dual wielding, but it doesn't come close to x2 the damage. More like an extra 5-10% maybe? Another thing to consider, is if you know you are going to have a monsters attention, you may want a shield instead. Not only for hte extra armor rating, but there are shields with nice attribute bonuses. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: What are their poisons like and could you explain the process in making them? 
 <br> I only got up to level 18, poisons start at lvl 20, sorry  
 <br> 
 <br> A: Human racial skill point abilities? Any insight would be sweet. In other words, do these effect combat? 
 <br> From what I know, I haven't seen or heard of races making any different in battle.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;Do you level fairly quickly (Like AC) or does it take much more time? Also, whats the best way to heal if you don't have a healing spell, and how effective is it? &quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Well their is a max level cap in WoW so the leveling is considerably slower then ac, but also faster then eq. The best way to heal in combat without a healing spell is healing potions/mana potions (but after you use one you have a 1 minute timer before you can use again so its not D2 potionfest ) and the best way to heal/rest out of combat is food/water (for health/mana regen)
 <br> 
 <br> Q:If I were to play a Pally and decide to use a sword vs blunt weapons... Would there be a signifigent disadvantage? Like would I be able to do the same amount of damage with a sword as a hammer? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:Yes, if you have a sword and a hammer of equal stats, you would do the same amount of damage with both. The only difference, is that you need to pay 2 skill poitns to learn swords. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: If you were going hardcore and exping constantly, how long would it take to get to level 20? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: It takes me about 7 days to get to level 20. But that's because I have a job, unlike some people  It takes about 5 hours to get to level 10. And about 36 hours to get to level 20, if you did non stop hard core leveling, like you said. To get to level 30... um... too long for me to think about  
 <br> 
 <br> BTW, Blizzard is still playing around with the leveling rate. They've made it slower and faster
 <br> 
 <br> Q:tradeskills.. are they in the game yet? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:Yes. Isn't this on the worldofwarcraft site though? I'm pretty sure it is, GFraizer was writing all kinds of stuff for it. That's why it has all the funny language, some people were complaining about here  
 <br> 
 <br> Tradeskill from the top of my head (I'm sure I&quot;ll miss some): 
 <br> Weaponsmith 
 <br> Armorsmith 
 <br> Leathercrafting 
 <br> Skinning 
 <br> Cooking 
 <br> Physician 
 <br> Enchanter 
 <br> Alchemy 
 <br> Tailoring 
 <br> Fishing 
 <br> Mining 
 <br> Engineering 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: facion (horde/alliance) changing.. in yet? coming soon? never? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:We haven't been exposed to it. From what I know, it's still coming. We also haven't been told about PvP (They are even super secret during the alpha!)
 <br> 
 <br> Q: PRIEST!
 <br> 
 <br> A: I too was in the alpha. I'll address the priest questions since it is my favorite class so far. 
 <br> 
 <br> Priest are quite a bit different then any other healer I have played in a mmorpg. First, they wear cloth armor, which means if you aren't careful you can go down fast. 
 <br> 
 <br> Now, one of the things that have impressed me about WoW is you can have various style of play and still have fun and do ok. While you might be able to argue for an uber leet template or style, you can easily play however you want and not feel gimped. 
 <br> 
 <br> I have seen many priests that take the old sit in the back and heal role, but I can say that isn't for me. The priest has a spell called holy word:shield. This space absorbs a set amount of damage depending on the level of the spell and last for 1 minute. The nice thing about it is the fact that it is insta cast. So you can cast this on a tank who holds agro and recast whenever needed with ease. This allows you to get in to the battle and melee with what you are attacking or sit back and cast DoTs or DD spells. 
 <br> 
 <br> This brings us to the caster part of the priest. You get a holy magic DD spell, a shadow magic DoT, a shadow magic sleep spell which is great for CC, a self buff that adds to melee damage and armor, an insta cast DD(that generates a large amount of agro), and various utility spells like remove curse and dispell magic. Oh yeah, they can heal too  Large long casting time heals and a shorter casting time(more mana efficeint) HoT. 
 <br> 
 <br> With the self buff and the insta-cast shield you can handle yourself in a melee fight. Obviously the healing and CC make for a pretty nice grouping class too. 
 <br> 
 <br> That is a rough overview of the priest, hopefully that answered most of your questions, let me know if you have more.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: How does First Aid work? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:There are raw materials that monsters will drop, that you would use in first aid. Such as linen (one of the first common items). You use linen to craft some bandages. 
 <br> 
 <br> Bandages can only be used by other players trained in First Aid. They can be used during combat, it takes 10 seconds to apply and you will heal for X amount. There is also some anti-venom stuff you can make.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: find this slightly amusing. I appreciate you sharing the info. 
 <br> 
 <br> It is just funny how a lot of it doesn't jibe with the hysteria people were building in their minds. 
 <br> 
 <br> People actually claimed Druids were awesome based on experiences of friends. People actually said the game was complete and ready to go, yet nobody has played past level 30. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Actually, the game in the current state is about 100x better than any other game out there in the market. The areas that we got to play in are extremely polished and tons of fun (Hey, I've been playing for 5 months under level 30 characters, it must be!) 
 <br> 
 <br> But as I said before, Blizzard is not ready for us to test some of the higher level content. They don't need us /bug ing things that they are aware need work on.
 <br> 
 <br> Q:&quot;Can a Paladin tank well? &quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I never played a pally or tank but almost all my friends at work play pallys and they seem to do very well melee.
 <br> 
 <br> I'll answer the paladin/warrior question. 
 <br> 
 <br> Warrior, focal point of a good group imo. They are the only class that get taunt. The ability to keep agro off casters is a must like in any mmorpg. They have various battle stances. You can use an offensive stance to have a higher damage output or a defensive stance that lets you taunt and take a lot more punishment. They have various other skills, but their main purpose is to take the hits and keep the casters safe imo. 
 <br> 
 <br> Paladins are a hybrid. They are very good at taking damage with their armor aura and can greatly increase the effectiveness of a part with auras and buffs, although the short durations on the buffs can be a little annoying. They can also heal. They are a very good secondary tank in a group, but without taunt they don't make up for a good warrior imo. The heals they cast are pretty good at generating agro though so often times healing can be almost as effective as taunts. 
 <br> 
 <br> One of the nicest things about the game is the custon interfaces you can make. I have seen one that will autocast buffs for you which probably takes the headache out of keeping a party buffed. I haven't really tried it though since it was released after I played my paladin.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is it very stable so far?&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: The game in alpha was more stable than any mmrpgs on the market heh. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;What kind of FPS are you getting in areas such as towns?&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I play at 1280x1024 and get solid fps. Never loaded up fraps so no clue on the actual fps. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:&quot;Is the combat dynamic or can I push a button and walk away?&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A:If you walk away you will come back dead coz the mob ran to get some friends heh.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: How many skill points do you get when you level? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:One, unless you are human. Humans get extra skill points at around level 15. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:What are some of your options you have? Do the amount of skill points change for each class? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:No, it doesn't change for class. Skill points are used to learn trade skills or some other extra skill... like riding a mount. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: In your opinions, what are the most important skills to learn? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Well... if you are in a guild, harvest trade skills would be what most guildmates should go for. You need ore, leather, herbs, and other resources to make a lot of the crafted items. A crafter is useless without them. By harvesting resources, you will be able to more easily acquire crafted items. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q:Can you unlearn skills? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Yes
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Any classes you played that might have a hard time finding a group? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Not really, all of the classes have something unique to bring to any group. Mages at one point were useless (they kept nerfing them) but on the last patch, they gave them new spells.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Any classes get Recall/Teleport/Mark -type spells?
 <br> 
 <br> A: Warlocks can teleport other players to them,t hrough a ritual. They also get a spirit stone recall spell... which I'm sure is bugged now that spirit binding is no longer in the game  
 <br> 
 <br> Mages get a teleportation spell around level 20 I believe (don't know much about it though.)
 <br> 
 <br> Q: How long does it take to unlearn skill points? What do you have to do? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: You bring up the skills panel. And you press on a cancel button next to the skill you want to unlearn. That's it. Instant unlearn, weee!
 <br> 
 <br> Q:Is it very stable so far? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Haha, that's a great question  You won't experience a crash, trust me  I probably gotten like 3 crashes in 5 months. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: What kind of FPS are you getting in areas such as towns? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: My framerate stays locked at 30 on outside areas, and 60 inside dungeons  
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is the combat dynamic or can I push a button and walk away? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Yep, you can walk away... 
 <br> 
 <br> ...expect to be dead when you return though  
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;What are the negatives about the game? Certainly it can't be all roses lets hear some of the bad stuff they need to change from your pov.&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: First off, I don't think it is as revolutionary as many people are hoping it will be (not yet anyway). While there are many many quests, most of them are still kill some type of monster over and over until you complete it. The quest help to soften the level grind, but it is still there. The nice thing though is you are almost always moving to new areas and killing new things and you don't just sit in a camp and wait for spawns (well, there are a few rare occations, but they are rare). 
 <br> 
 <br> I think the main draw back of the game is the way characters skills are. It is a lot like EQ. Every priest has the same spells, every mage has the same spells, every fighter/paladin/etc have the same skills. The only thing to set you apart from other characters are how you spend your talent points and the gear you have. These can make a pretty big difference, but not to the degree that I or many other people would like. I can imagine the people who are in love with the AC1 style system will hate this. 
 <br> 
 <br> It is hard to say what else is wrong with it because many things are still changing and PvP (which is a major issue) isn't in the game yet. The economy seems to need some serious work, but it is no where near finished.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: So lets say I'm a pally and have my great hammer, it's fun, uber sword drops that's better then my hammer. Do I loot because I can just go untrain two points then put them into sword skill? Switch whenever it's convient for me type thing? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Well to begin with... you can't untrain hammer as a paladin. Hammer is free. 
 <br> 
 <br> Two, you need to work up a skill. So if you are a level 30 player, and you just found an awesome sword, you train in sword then, you ain't gonnna hit level 30 monsters for a very long time.
 <br> 
 <br> Just to add to this. You can't untrain weapon skills atm. Just trade skills. So if you learn swords or 2h swords/mace then you will always know them. 
 <br> 
 <br> Side note: This is one of the few games I have actually found it easy to keep multiple weapon skills up to par. I have know a few warriors that have keep 3 different weapon skills high enough to use any of them depending on what weapons they found or bought. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;I *hope* untraining isnt as simple as clicking *cancel* whenever you feel like.&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: It is, but right now it only works on trade skiils so it isn't that big of a deal. Also, if you decide to switch back to your old one you will have to start all over again, thus losing all the time and more importantly resources and money you put into raising the skill in the first placec.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is there a /stick command can you make MACROS for you quickbar?
 <br> 
 <br> A: There is no /stick command in the game yet. Yes you can make macros on your quickbar. You even have choices as to what your macro icon will look like.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;What are the negatives about the game? Certainly it can't be all roses lets hear some of the bad stuff they need to change from your pov.&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Keep in mind that the game has been in alpha, and just bearly now has gone into beta. 
 <br> 
 <br> So I could sit here and whine about things I don't like... but they are actually getting to. i.e. ambient sound is lacking, but after I voice my complains (many many times  , they let me know that is something they are working on in the background. 
 <br> 
 <br> You need to understand, that just because you don't see it now in the game, does not mean they are not working on it. Blizzard likes to add new content when it's finished/polished, even if it's beta or alpha.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot; Is there a /stick command  can you make MACROS for you quickbar?&quot;
 <br> 
 <br> A: yes and yes. You can easily make macros to cast spells like sleep and add things like &quot;/p casting sleep on %t&quot; 
 <br> which tells your part who you are casting sleep on. %t is replaced by the name of your target.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: &quot;So the skill system is kind of like EQ. You purchase the skill at the cost of skill points and they that skill goes up to some cap as you level and use the skill? 
 <br> 
 <br> Is it the same way with mages as well? 
 <br> 
 <br> Interupts in casting?&quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: The only skills that take skill points are for warriors and paladin to learn weapons other then the ones you start with. All other skills just cost money to learn. If I want to learn sleep rank 2 I just find a priest trainer and give him 50 silver or whatever it costs and I now know it. 
 <br> 
 <br> Spell interupts are rare. There are a few skills that will interupt spells like stuns/pummel/sleep. On the other hand though if you get hit while you are casting it increases the casting time. So, if your casting a spell a spell with say a 3 second casting time and get hit then it might add say 1 second onto the total casting time. It you have two mobs hitting you at once it can make it almost impossible to cast a spell at times. 
 <br> 
 <br> Also, for skill ratings you are capped at lvl*5. So a level 20 priest can have a shadow magic skill up to 100. This skill, like weapon skill for a warrior, is used to determine if you hit with the spell/weapon
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is the game fun? In other words, is there enough conent in what you have seen so far that a player will always have something fun to do and how is the treadmill? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Depends what race you play. Some playgrounds are more fun than others. 
 <br> 
 <br> Humans 10/10 
 <br> Dwarves-Gnomes 9/10 
 <br> NE 8/10 
 <br> Undead 8/10 
 <br> Tauren 9/10 
 <br> Orc-Trolls 7/10 
 <br> 
 <br> That's my personal opinion of the content that I've seen. At the moment, there is enough content to play all the way to level 30 for humans. But for the horde, there wasn't, but there is stuff constantly been added. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Compare the size of landmass you have seen with that of Dereth - is it diverse and big enough that you can really explore - like we use to do in AC? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Heh... Do you remember how Turbine stated that AC2 would be smaller than AC? But that AC2 would pack more content per square inch, but they didn't deliver? Well, Blizzard didn't state the same, but the amount of content they pack into every square inch of the game is insane! Yes, the landmass has a very huge variaty of environments, you are not going to be disappointed... the most shocking environments are undwater... they actually put atmosphere into underwater dwellings!!!
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Can one you guys elaborate on instances and world dungeons? Do you spend most of your time there leveling, or is questing the best way to level in your experience.. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: No one camps in instance dungeons, you adventure in them  Yes, if you don't quest, you are going to be left behind. Sure you can go out and kill monsters over and over again, no one is ever going to stop you from doing what you want to do. But you are goign to be missing out on hundreds of quests and the experience points that comes with them.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: In game macroing.... 
 <br> 
 <br> A:There are people at blizzard whos jobs consist of writing bots to try and do this type of thing. The reason for this is so they can prevent it. From what I have seen it is not &quot;easy&quot; to do. There are very few camps where you could just park a character and have them keep killing stuff, and the ones that do exsist are usually high enough density and tough enough that the bot would have a lot of trouble staying alive. Also, ever character has a fair number of skills/spells they use in combat. It would be hard to make a bot that could effectively use these imo which would make them about 50%-75% as effective as a human player at best imo. While it is currently possible, I know they are working hard to make it so it isn't. 
 <br> 
 <br> Instance dungeons.... I love these things so much and whilte I have many features I like about the game this one truely is my favoite. The ones they have currently are huge dungeons with some sort of story behind them. They are also pure dungeon crawls. You start at the begining and fight your way through to the big battle or boss at the end. These things take on average 2-3 hours to complete. Best of all you get the whole place to yourself. Don't have to worry about other groups camping a boss or any nonsense like that. They are just amazing, and I'm not sure I could do justice to the amount of fun it is to do one of these with a good group of friends. I have had very few experiences in mmorpgs that were more fun then these. 
 <br> 
 <br> While these are fun the 2-3 hour time commitment keeps people from doing these too often. The monsters in them are elite monsters (tougher then normal mobs their level and worth a fair amount more exp) which does make them good for exp grinding if you want to do that, but overall quests are usually the way to go for experiencing.
 <br> 
 <br> Qnow for the big question with the ingame macro system, is it easy to AFK combat macro can you make a looping macro that plays your character for you?
 <br> 
 <br> A: Hehehe... actually... Did you guys ever read that funny SWG joke, someone wrote up? It was about a bot someone wrote, that would respond &quot;Dude!&quot; when it's character name was spoke and &quot;Dude?&quot; when someone asked a question. It would auto accept group invitations and would following the group leader around, auto-attacking whatever monster came in it's range... it was a pretty funny article, anyways... 
 <br> 
 <br> ...one of the Blizzard interface developers, wrote a bot just like that for WoW, for entertainment purposesly only  
 <br> 
 <br> In anycase, I'm not sure that answers your question. I'm not a big macro person myself, so I don't know much about how to exploit the game system.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: The quests sound like the boring old terminal &quot;missions&quot; from FFXI...i really hope its not like that (i.e. go kill this nest of bats or something along those lines). If those are the &quot;quests&quot; then I'd rather find a nice spot to hunt and stay there. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: No, they are nothing like that. A human been actually sat down and wrote a story for each quest that you receive.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Jabb, how viable is it to quest solo? Will an npc insist or recommend that you form a party, or will you have to find that out, hehe, the hard way? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Quests will show you what difficultly they are in your quest book. 
 <br> 
 <br> Gray - Why haven't you finished this? 
 <br> Green - Easy 
 <br> Yellow - Your level 
 <br> Orange - A challenge, may need assistance 
 <br> Red - You will die 
 <br> 
 <br> Then there is the key word &quot;Elite&quot; - Elite quests, you must certainly will need to group with someone. Although there have been a couple of elite quests I have been able to do on my own, through some fancy foot work, potions, and buffs RAWWR! *flex* 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: I too was in the Alpha. As for buff bots, I will say yes, there WILL be buff bots, but those will be created by users. They are allowing people to modify the scripts for the interface and it can do lots and lots of things. A buff bot will be available as soon as someone writes one, and they will. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Someone could certainly write a script that w ould cast a spell on someone. Is this a big deal? No. i.e. say there is a priest buff-bot... what buffs is it going to cast on you? Um.. there is only one, a stamina one. Big whoop, so he casted one buff on you. Is it really worth it to have a bot for casting a single spell? 
 <br> 
 <br> It's the same for other classes, you don't get a huge arsenal of &quot;buff other player&quot; spells.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Oh..oh..oh...two last little question and I am set. How customizable are character looks at creation? 
 <br> and... Do your weapons appear on your character(as in sheathed swords) when not in use? Thanks a bunches. &quot; 
 <br> 
 <br> A: There are a moderate number of choices. This has also been a place many think the game is lacking. Of course more skins/textures and such are something they could easily add later. 
 <br> 
 <br> Many of the weapons have unique graphics and a put away type animation. For instance I have a dwarven paladin with a big 2h sword and when it is put away it is strapped across his back and looks sweet  1h weapons hang at the side of your character. No sheath though atm, so if you character trips it could hurt.  
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Oh..oh..oh...two last little question and I am set. 
 <br> How customizable are character looks at creation? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:That's one area I'm very disappointed in  Not much selection. Boo! They say they are going to add more artwork though. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Do your weapons appear on your character(as in sheathed swords) when not in use? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Well, your weapon does retract to your side (or on your back, if it's a two handed weapon). But there isn't an actual sheathe that inserts into.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: 
 <br> How was rogue combat? Sneak up to monster stealthed and backstab 4 teh win? Were there side / front / back positional styles that let you do extra dmg? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:Rogue combat is very fast and it's not so much of doing extra damage from the position you are facing your opponent, but rather each time you do a special move, it adds to your combo-points. The more combo-points you have, the beter of a finishing move you can execute
 <br> 
 <br> Q: there any tools in place or in planning to help easily find groups so far you know of? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Actually, there is something coming down the pipeline that is going to make things very easy. Not gonna say anythign else on it though  
 <br> 
 <br> Q: what about the loot? Is it kinda like AC where it pulls u in to find better or to find that rare item? 
 <br> 
 <br> A:The loot system sucks. They are working on it though. Right now there are only static items in the game (In otherwords, someone hand crafted each one.)
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Also what about armor? Does everyone looks the same or can u personalize what u look like? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Heh, there is tons of armor art... don't worry, you'll get the same mis-matching look, like Asheron's call  Or you can try to get an entire set, good luck  Fun though when you do  
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Shamens! Are they more healers, or combat caster? Or just a mixture of both? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: They are decent healers, but better at combat I would say. I love that they have three different lines of combat play: Totems... Combat spells... and healing  
 <br> 
 <br> They have some cool instant + long range spells combos. i.e. You start with long range spells, and as a monster gets closer, you hit them with instant short range spells. If you get in trouble, you cast a bind totem, and run away  
 <br> 
 <br> Or if you are in a group, you can become a dedicated healer and attack once in a while, when you have the mana to spare
 <br> 
 <br> Q: From what I've been reading, it seems that ppl are going to max level WAY too fast, lvl 30 in a couple weeks? Even if going from there to lvl 60 takes 2 months at the most, seems like it would get boring really soon.. Am taking this wrong? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Maybe, I don't know. No one has gotten to level 60. There is still a lot of high level content that we have not been exposed to.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Mages get a mana tap does this mean no down time for them? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Mana tap is good enough for you to get some extra spell attacks in, but not so much that your mana bar stays at full.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: It is definately a sign of good things. But anyone claiming the game is done is just being silly. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: If it was done, it would be out. It's not out. However, that does not make it any less true, that WoW is an incredible game right now. WoW is the most fun MMORPG right now that you can play  Will it keep you playing 3 years at the moment? Well no, it's not done. but you'll have a blast playing what there is to do right now  
 <br> 
 <br> Q:Trade skills 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I'm not sure what you want to know about tradeskills. They are for the most part pretty simple. Blacksmithing requires metals, stone, and various gems. These are mainly gathers by mineral nodes that spawn at random around different areas (not completely random in the fact that there is a set number of places they can spawn.) Someone one with the mining skill can extract these resources and then a blacksmith can combine them into different items. Engineering uses the same resources. Alchemy and enchanting require herbs which are gathered like minerals by a herbalist. Most of your recipes are acquired from a trainer, but there are many recipes that are dropped off of monsters or bought from hidden trainers. These dropped recipes tend to be the more useful ones too. Leatherworking requires leather that you have to have a skinner to harvest from &quot;beast&quot; class mobs. Tailors use linen/wool/silk that are dropped off a humanoids. It doesn't require a whole lot of time to level these skills up, but the cost of recipes and resources can be pretty high.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: What is the coolest spell effect (visually) that you have seen so far? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: OOo... that has to be this one spell an NPC cast on me once. The sky filled with dark heavy black clouds and lighting would errupt out of it, hitting targets on the ground, very very cool looking  Especially the way the clouds look 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Have you had the chance to engage in any PvP yet? If so give some details on your experiences. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I've not had much experience with pvp 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: What are your comp stats you are running WoW on? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: P4 3.2ghz w/ Radeon 9800 Pro 256MB... so of course, I don't experience a slow down, heh. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Have your or anyone else tried swimming to The Maelstrom as an undead yet? :P 
 <br> 
 <br> A: You'll die from fatigue first  So, no 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Poleaxes in game? (poleaxes rule) 
 <br> A: Yes, there are. You can see monsters use them, players can access them at lvl 40. Their animation is very awesome  
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is crafting points and skill points in the same pool? (ex. you can have 100 melee skillls and 0 craft, 50/50 or 0/100? ) 
 <br> 
 <br> A: You don't manually train up your skills. They go up by use. You can max all of them out through sufficient use. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Are there any race restrictions on crafting? Like gnomes can't be miners for example. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: None 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Have you experienced an instanced dungeon? Are the dungeons like dungeon siege? (walk in) or like daoc (sone in). 
 <br> 
 <br> A: You only zone into the instance portion of a dungeon. In otherwords, there are many dungeons that you don't zone into. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Have you seen any good info about Paladins? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I played two Paladins... one up to level 20, another up to level 25. I think I have some good info  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Are Paladins playable atm, and Have you seen one? Impressions of the class please 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I love the Paladin (Hey, that's why I played it twice!) At one point, I was dead certain that was going to be the class I play in retail. Now, I'm not too sure because I've now played several other classes that turn out to be a lot of fun too  
 <br> 
 <br> What I like about the Paladin in WoW, is that you get defensive spells to go along with your bronze. Like Divine Shield (protects you from attacks, and allows you to attack), Lay Hands (Instantly restore full health to a target), but most value is Resurrection. What I came to learn, is that if a group is venturing into a dangerous area (i.e. world dungeon) and you get into a sticky situation... where teammates start dying left and right, who do you think is more likely to survive this situation? A priest or a paladin? A paladin of course  Having a paladin with resurrection is awesome, because then your team is not out of the adventure 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is there class and or race specific Gear? (like Diablo 2 and many other games have class specific stuff) 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Very few pieces, but yes. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Do you buy mounts? Do you have go to a stable to get them? Or do you just whip them out of your arse like swg 
 <br> 
 <br> A: We haven't gotten to play with them.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Do Warriors receive the Dual Wield ability? If yes, when? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: No, they don't.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is collision detection in the game? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Well.. ya... you collide with tables, chairs, and the land... why wouldn't this be in a game?
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is level 60 definatly that Highhest level? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: If you are asking if the game is technologically limited to, then no. Blizzard can change the cap to anything they want, at any time. It sounds like they will place the cap at 60 on retail. This is subject to change though. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: and how long has it taken for people to get to levle 30? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: A very long time. About 250 hours. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: If so I will be very disappointed I've been playing AC for 4 years now and still haven't reached the cap and if the game is as vast as I hear I feel going and doing everything at my cool new maxed level could get very boring and un challenging! 
 <br> 
 <br> A: You'll need to play the game, to understand the difference between AC and WoW. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Secondly Do you feel the instanced dungeons cuts out of the social factor at all? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Ya, I hated this idea when I heard about it (Before I got to play the game.) But actually it doesn't cut out any social factor at all. It actually increases the the fun factor, because usually you are going to go into an instance dungeon with a group. And you don't have to worry about the dungeon been horribly camped or griefers ruining your experience. I know this is difficult to understand coming from AC (I was a big AC player myself.) You'll just have to play the game for yourself, to fully understand. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: and are quests dungeons instanced to? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I'm not sure what you mean by this. Quests are quests. A quest may take you to a dungeon, it might not. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Thirdly Does the quest system actually invovle brains, eg do you have to pull levers to open doors and such? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Not that I have seen, and I really hope that they add some puzzles into the game. 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Fourthly What is the experience points pass up like in the allegiance systems if any? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: No points. I think AC franchise is the only MMO that does this. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: And is there a place where the whole allegiance can collectivly recall to, eg liek mansiosn in AC? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Guild housing isn't in.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: did you by chance come across the Poly Morph Spells? Or were they more restricted to the higher levels?
 <br> 
 <br> A: Polymorph is a mage spell which was removed from player hands currently due to the fact that it was incredibly powerful. You can still find plenty of monsters that will polymorph you though. What it does is turn you into a pig and reduces your damage output. In addition it prevents you from casting.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Will quests ever take you into an instanced dungeon? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Yes, there are several quests which involve killing the boss of an instanced dungeon (Van Cleef in Deadmines, Arugal in Shadowfang amongst others). 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Will an instanced dungeon ever be a quest (ie. Joe Blow sends you to wipe out the gremlins in instanced dungeon B.) 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Not specifically though there are actually quest gives inside instances who will tell you to wipe out a certain type of critter or do a certain mission inside that instance (Wailing Caverns has one to awaken the sleeper by killing 4 named shadow druids).
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is there an archer class and if so: 
 <br> 
 <br> 1) Do they kill at range 
 <br> 2) Do they melee with bow 
 <br> 3) all of the above  
 <br> 
 <br> A: Well, there are several classes that can train in using a bow, but the only class that is proficient at it would be the Hunter, I believe.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br>  No. Period. You can pull with a gun or bow, that's it. The range is short and they come running as soon as you hit them. 
 <br>  No, you will use a normal weapon. 
 <br>  That's it.  
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: Is the combat still hyperclick point? Eg you need to sit there clicking where you want to hit and when, or can u just whack a button and your away? I hate clicking constantly! 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> A: You can just hit a button and whack away but you need more interaction than that if you want to perform styles or other combat actions.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: So your telling me that if I'm in a snazzy mood and wanna take it down with style and quick I can interact, but if I really can't be bothered I can just sit and watch it!! 
 <br> 
 <br> A: For instance, the Rogue has an opening move...if you land a hit it allows other special moves to happen. The extent of these moves is based off of how much energy you have and how much you've used. Energy is very a measured factor like Mana for casters and rage for fighters
 <br> 
 <br> Q: What is up with the lack of helms/hoods/hats in all of the released screenshots? Were you all told to remove them for screenshot purposes or is there a serious lack of them in the game? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: From what I've seen helms are available at a higher level...like 20+ or something along those lines. Your average n0ob will not be able to run out and gai the benefit of a helm for quite some time. Of course, this could have been planned for the early stages of the game and may change on release.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: lets say a monster is standing behind a tree. do ranged attacks or spells connect? 
 <br> 
 <br> are ranged attacks &quot;instant damaging&quot; or are they projectile. example: a ranger shoots a gun at a player, is it possible for that player to run behind an object to avoid the shot, or is the damage instant and non-avoidable? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: From what I've seen, no ranged attacks can be dodged by just moving. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: how does air transportation work/cost? 
 <br> 
 <br>  A: Depends on the route you are going...there is no set price that covers ALL routes 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: do i have to be a certain lvl to buy a ticket? must i complete a quest to &quot;unlock&quot; air tickets? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: No, but some travel can be quite expensive early on in the game so you will most likely be pounding some virtual ground to get where you need to go until you can afford travel 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: what would be the best/earliest way for a clan (of different races) to migrate into the same town. could this be done by newly created characters? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: IMHO it's best to level as much as you can with doing the quests that are set up for starting toons. This will help you navigate the more dangerous areas when trying to hook up with your friends. Thee are ship routes that instantly warp you from one mainland to the other. After that, you will have to run to each air travel location to establish that you knwo the route for travel. YES, you must first travel between towns before the route is opened for you to fly it
 <br> Q: read sumwhere that you can only receive 1 buff per person. is this still true? 
 <br> if not, how do buffs work. is there a limit to how many can be cast on you, others, etc? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: No limit to buffs, or at least none that I've seen. Have had 8 buffs on me so far. 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: I was wondering if you would know the starting stats between the Alliance races? I'm most interested in humans vs. night elves stat wise. 
 <br> 
 <br> A: I'd have to make a night elf and human of same class and compare stats, so maybe will do that later. But every race starts off with 30 bonus stat points. Amoung each race, 26 pts are divided amoung the stats pertaining to each race (ie: orcs get more strenght pts than undead). Then 4 stat pts are divided amoung the stats based on which class you pick. 
 <br> 
 <br> Those are the numbers I believe, I could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure that's how the stat points are divided up.
 <br> 
 <br> Q: i read sumwhere that you can only receive 1 buff per person. is this still true? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: Yes 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> Q: if not, how do buffs work. is there a limit to how many can be cast on you, others, etc? 
 <br> 
 <br> A: There is no limit to how many can be on you. There is a limit to how many another player can cast on you though. And that limit is 1
