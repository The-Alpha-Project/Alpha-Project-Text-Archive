The development team brought some GenCon inaccuracies to my attention which I wanted to pass along to all of you.

· Druids have an underwater mount.

Druids will be able to turn into an underwater animal, but they will not have an underwater mount.

· Paladins can use swords but can not use their talent points to specialize in them. They can only specialize in 2H or 1H maces. Paladins should be able to use firearms.

Paladins can learn to use swords if they want and then use talent points to specialize in them, but only after they have learned how to use them.

· Cartography will be a trade skill. It may reveal more of the map to you.

This May be a trade skill (time permitting).

· Each Trade skill has about 30 things available to make

Trade skills vary from 30 to 70 items currently and will likely be more like 50 to 100 at ship (if not more).

· You can attack on mounts.

You WILL NOT be able to attack on mounts, unless something drastic changes in our production pipeline.

· You can't use a mount until level 30.

You can currently not use a mount until level 40, but the final specifics have yet to be decided.

· Beverages may not be in the game. They haven't been implemented yet. But cooking still will. Beverages were another way to replenish help with at rest.

Drinks will be in the game. There will likely not be a trade skill that makes them however.

· Max level in final game will probably be around 60 although another reports has stated 70 based on what Blizzard stated at the show.

Level 60 is the max for ship.

· Invisibility spells reduce the agro range of mobs.

Invis spells do not change the agro behavior of mobs, but stealth does.

· Underwater breathing lasts between 20 or 30 seconds

Its currently 90 seconds, though this may change.

· You can jump from the highest point in the world, and land onto the lowest point without any damage being done to yourself.

There will be falling damage, though what form it will take is unclear.

· There's is no PvP mode outside of consented dueling.

There will be a PvP system in the game that is more than dueling. You will not need to participate if you don’t want to, but we anticipate it being fun enough that everyone will want to.


The following items have not been decided at this time:
