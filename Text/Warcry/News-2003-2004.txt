Starcraft: Ghost Warcry
Posted by: Loren_3000 Category: WoW Time: 2:38 AM (EST)

If you haven't heard yet, the wee hours of this morning saw a massive hiring of new staff for our site. Notwithstanding MMO coverage, we will be devoted to covering SC: Ghost from now on. Our staff all agreed that Ghost was more cool-looking anyhow.

As we kick off this change, you can check out the coverage of SC: Ghost, including screenshots, concept art, and even movies and wallpapers, here!

New Frozen Throne Hero!
Posted by: Craftstar Category: Blizzard Time: 2:00 AM (EST)

Check out the page on the upcoming new Frozen Throne hero, the Goblin Tinker!

The Goblins are angry and they've had enough! Many inhabitants of Azeroth have been taking the Goblins for granted. Goblin Zeppelins transport thousands of passengers daily. Goblin Shredders clear acres of forests to support Horde and Alliance war efforts. Goblin Sappers give up their lives via Kaboom to serve their war commander's needs. Goblin Merchants, Laboratories, and Goblin Shipyards provide additional services and merchandise. For what reward? It's time to pay the Goblins back! The Goblin Tinker is coming for you!

ALSO, Blizzard has made a special announcement which players can find here. (Forum regulars should pick up on this one.)

Two-Headed Ogres!
Posted by: zeeg Category: WoW Time: 1:01 AM (EST)

Two-Headed Ogres Added as a Playable Race in World of Warcraft - 04/01/04

It’s official: Blizzard Entertainment is proud to announce that Two-headed Ogres are now a playable race in World of Warcraft, our upcoming massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Giving two separate players simultaneous control of a single body, this new race introduces a unique cooperative gaming experience never before attempted. See them for yourself in this exclusive preview, which includes the first available screenshots and an exciting first look at the innovative new game mechanics. Current beta testers should expect to see this new content added in the coming weeks.

By selecting the Two-headed Ogre race, you are selflessly choosing to share your existence in World of Warcraft with another player. That is, you are staking claim to one half of the Ogre whole. As a Two-headed Ogre, you will have control of one head and one arm at all times. Your other half will be controlled by a second player automatically and permanently paired with you upon character creation…

Kat post updates on Tabbard Icons
Posted by: Lewt Category: Blizzard Time: 7:20 PM (EST)

Kat posted here about new icons added for Tabbards (Guilds?) into the system increasing the number from 50 to 150+

Last week, I asked for Tabard Icon suggestions. At that time, we had about 50 icons already in the game. You all came through with GREAT ideas and just about every suggestion submitted (that met the requirements) is being created to be used as one of the 150+ new Tabard Icons!

Some examples of what we’re adding:

# Animal faces (Cat, Rabbit, Lion, Ram, Dragon, Bull, Stag, etc.)

# Crossed weapons (Hammers, Axes, Swords, Spears, Arrows, Scythes, etc...)

# Multiple 'Skull and Crossbones'

# Nature elements (Water Drop, Snowflake, Flames, Sapling, etc...)

# Food Items (Chicken Leg, Muffin, Bowl of Soup, etc...)

And many more …

Update on the Community site
Posted by: Aorn Category: Battle.net Time: 2:54 AM (EST)

A large update recently arrived, leaving us a great deal of information and previews.

    Penny Arcade has a new supplemental WoW Log that I think everyone will like, and I’ve found a nice spell database at Warcraft Central too. For those of you who have been enjoying journals, WoW Stratics has a new entry in their Beta Journals and WorldofWar.net has a nice story entitled Stitches, Saviour of WoW that I think you will enjoy.
    A Few World of Warcraft Previews:


    Gamespy: World of Warcraft Preview: "The beta period begins for the hottest MMO currently in development, and Delsyn discovers that getting into the World of Warcraft can be hazardous to your health."

    Gameraiders: World of Warcraft PC Preview: "Breathtaking. Spectacular. Easily the best online RPG I have ever seen -- and this is only the beta!"

    Gamezone: World of Warcraft: "World of Warcraft is wonderfully deep, visually delightful and a ton of fun to play!"

Beta Testers Being Heard!
Posted by: Nehkara Category: WoW Time: 5:54 PM (EST)

Katricia posted today on the WoW Beta General Discussion forum saying that all of the suggestions and bugs that have been reported to Blizzard by the beta testers are being looked at, and she listed several things that are being done for the next push as a result of suggestions and bug reports. These include cloaks being visible on character models. Here is the full list:

    Suggestions:

    - Equipped cloaks will be visible.
    - Darnassus, Stormwind, Orgrimmar and Undercity have all undergone layout changes to be easier to navigate (eventually all major cities will be overhauled)
    - As a ghost, you can now reincorporate from a further distance from your corpse, and you will reincorporate with 50% health and mana
    - More recipes are being added for many of the tradeskills.
    - A new spawn system is being put in place to help prevent monsters from spawning on top of players

    Fixed Bugs & Tweaks:

    - Helpful actions such as healing and paladin auras no longer extend a creature’s pursuit timer.
    - Guild petitions will work.
    - Deadmines: The VanCleef encounter and Goblin Foundry have been retuned.
    - Many spawn times have been increased, especially in the newbie zones.

WoW Release Date Past July?
Posted by: Lewt Category: Blizzard Time: 9:45 PM (EST)

EnoYIs of Blizzard posted on the blizzard forums details about the release date of WoW.

Definately not July. As you know, we never set release dates, but you can expect the beta to run for another 5+ months since we have lots of content to test.

-Eno


Looks like we'll have plenty of time to get into the beta and hopefully a lenghty open beta!
