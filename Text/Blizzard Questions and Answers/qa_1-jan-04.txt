· Will WoW be playable on a Mac and are people currently testing it on Macs?

Yes, to both. The game will be available on a Mac and there are people currently playing on Macs. Minimum specifications have not yet been determined.

· Will the druid be able to avoid obstacles like mountains when morphed into “flying” models?

This was a considered option but the design team decided it would be too powerful of an ability.

· EBWorld has a release date of 06/14/03, is this accurate?

We’re not sure where they got that date from as no date has been set for WoW’s release.

· Will there be items available to allows characters (other then Undead) to breath underwater for durations to exceed 90 seconds?

Yes, including but not limited to: Items found and/or quested for, crafted items, potions and class based spells.

· When a warrior fights will he just stand there swinging a sword or will he have combat moves?

There are currently six to eight combat moves per stance with multiple stances available for warriors.

Now why would we end War Craft?

No.

· How many servers will there be when WoW is released and what are the server names?

There will be a lot of servers. Names have not yet been assigned to them.

· Will players be able to select what server they play on?

Yes.

· Can players customize the height & weight of their characters?

Height/Weight is unlikely to be changeable due to how it affects character animations and items on the character. Also if you change height and weight then the distinction between an orc and a human becomes much less when they are both wearing similar armor. The combination of wanting distinct animations and not wanting the animations to look wonky because they were being used on a model they were not quite meant for, made us decide to not allow changing of height/weight at this time.

· Will WoW be colorblind friendly?

Yes, several members of the development team are color blind so this has been taken into consideration.

· Make Horde females look better!

Some of the female horde art is being reworked, but don’t expect to see “gorgeous” trolls running around.

· Will horde and alliance characters have the ability to gain faction points thus allowing them to utilize each other’s cities?

That’s currently not the plan.


As always, everything listed is subject to change. I will let you all know if/when that happens.
