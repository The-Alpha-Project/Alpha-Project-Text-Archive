<span class="section">Items</span><br><br>

<!-- ----- CONTENT AREA --------->
<!--
Being that World of Warcraft is a Massively Multiplayer <b>Role Playing Game</b> there are many items of multiple different types.
Be they swords and axes, or potions and cloth, you'll be using a lot of items in World of Warcraft, so you better start learning about them!
<br><br>
Before we learn about some of the items that are in the game, we should probably learn about the inventory.<br><br>
<font class=header>Inventory</font><br>
<br><b><u>Weapons</u></b><br>
<b>Main Hand:</b> Primary weapon or tool will go in this hand. Example: Sword or Axe<br>
<b>Ranged Weapon:</b> Secondary (or primary on some characters) weapon.  Example: Bow or Rifle<br>
<b>Ammunition:</b> Ammunition for ranged weapons will go here.  Example: Bows, Gunpowder<br>
<br><b><u>Armour</u></b><br>
<b>Body:</b> Body Armour and Clothes<br>
<b>Belt:</b> Store potions and scrolls here.  Some belts may have more space then others<br>
<b>Fret:</b> Sleeves<br>
<b>Hands:</b> Gloves or Gauntlets<br>
<b>Head:</b> Helmet or a Mask<br>
<b>Legs:</b> Pants, Leggings, etc.<br>
<br><b><u>Accessories</u></b><br>
<b>Fingers (2):</b> Rings with various magical effects.<br>
<b>Neck:</b> Necklaces or Amulets.<br>
<b>Trinkets (4):</b> Miscellaneous things that you may or may not use.  Torches, matches, books, food etc.<br>
<b>Wrists (2):</b> Bracers will be equipped here.  Maybe there will be other stuff too.<br>
<br><br>
<font class=header>Item Quality</font><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Poor Quality  (Grey Text)
<li>Common Quality  (Yellow Text)
<li>Uncommon Quality  (Green Text)
<li>Rare Quality  (Blue Text)
<li>more to come at higher levels...
</ul>
<font class=header>Item Finding</font><br><br>
When will you find items for certain slots on your character?<br><br>
<b>At level 1:</b> Chest, Shirt, Hands, Legs, Feet, Waist, Wrist<br>
<b>At higher levels</b> (not revealed), listed in the order at which you will find them: Shoulder/Finger, Head/Neck, Trinket. <br>
<br>
<font class=header>Item Bounding</font><br><br>
You may have heard a lot about Item Bounding and Binding.  This refers to the flexibility given with the item regarding equiping/removing/trading, and the like.<br>
There are five levels of bounding:
<ul>
<li><b>Not Bound:</b>  Equipping, removing, and trading can be done at any time.
<li><b>Bind on Equip:</b>  If the item hasn't been equipped it can be traded.  Otherwise it can not be traded to other players.
<li><b>Bind on Use:</b>  Once used the item can not be traded.
<li><b>Bind on Acquire:</b>  Once acquired the item can't be traded with other players.  Be careful with these, your friends may get mad!
<li><b>Quest Items:</b>  Quest Items are bound to your character permanently (you may lose them through a Quest). You cannot trade them. 
</ul>
There will be random drop tables in the game (like Diablo 2), and items will also have random stat modifiers.  The system can create unique items, such as "Sword of Lifestealing", or "Breastplate of Stamina".  When this happens 
the base item has a random modifier, such as lifestealing, applied to it.<br><br>
At some stages in your career the best item will be a crafted item, at other stages it will be a quest item.  For example at level 40 the best bracer might be a quest item, while at level 45 the best item might be a crafted item.  As long as you have the correct materials,
you'll be able to create this item over-and-over until it isn't worth anything!  <br><br>
When you are in a group you get notification of what group members are looting.  If you click on the notification it will show you the statistics of the item.  This ensures that:<br>
a) your friends aren't lying to you<br>
b) you can ask them to trade for the uber leet sword of wrath<br>
c) you don't even have to worry about bothering them with "can I see, can I see?"<br>
The same thing also happens in chat.  If you want to trade an item start a chat and then simply hold the shift key and click the item.  Its name will appear in chat and others can click the name to view what
you are trying to sell them (no scamming low level players I guess).  If you ever see something along the lines of [Uber Sword of Slaying] then you can click on it to see the stats.<br><br>
There are also rare badges and artifacts that high level characters can find.  The best items are available to those who get involved in the story.<br><br>
(Note, that was a theoretical example, those items may or may not exist).<br><br>
<font class=header>Storage</font><br><br>
As for storage, each player starts the game with five bag slots.  Your carrying capacity is limited by one thing only, the size of your bags.  You can find or buy larger bags to fill the slots.  There are even 
some extremely rare bags in the game.  Also, each character can access a bank account.  It starts with between 3 and 5 slots (specific number is unknown
at this point).  You can upgrade these with bigger bags AND you can pay a fee to upgrade the size, allowing for more bag slots.  The maximum is around 20, but the more slots your bank has, the more expensive the next becomes.  Buying a 6th slot
could be affordable, but the 19th or 20th might be extremely costly.  Banks can be accessed in all major cities.  Despite the fact that banks are only in cities, it won't take long to get to them.  A high level character
could do all his banking in about 2 minutes.<br><br>
Some items stack in the game, which will save inventory space.  In the current state, potions stack (some to 5, others to 10 or 20), food stacks (max of 20), and beverages stack (max of 20).  
To break a stack hold the Shift key and click on it.  This will bring up a box that asks for the quantity you want to take out.<br><br>
