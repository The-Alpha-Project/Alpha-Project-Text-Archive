<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image1.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image1.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
It seems to be some sort of mystical... portal.  Thin particles of teal-blue light swirl around its entrance as if sucked into the peculiar vortex by a force unknown to man or dwarf.  The architecture is now most definately Elvish, as I could see a moonwell in the distance.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image2.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image2.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
As I got closer, part of me wanted to know what was on the other side of that portal, while the larger, much more chicken part of me wanted to scamper away with my tail between my legs.  I approached closer and stuck my hand through, but nothing seemed to happen -- almost as if it wasnt even active.  A shame, I thought, as I would have ended up probably jumping in with sword drawn if this actually went somewhere.  Soon, I suppose, the owner of this gateway would return.  Maybe my chance is then!<br/>
<br/>
I walked over to some of the other Elven architectual oddities and came across one of their fabled moonwells... the deep bluish purple water housing unknown spiritual energies. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself "Hmm, perhaps this well is how those night elven chicks stay so... firm" and jumped in... alas, I did not suddenly grow two finely shapened nightelfesque breasts on my chest, so in dismay I hopped back out.  <br/>
<br/>
After spending a bit more time poking around the grove, I resumed my trek back to darkshire to see what other whacky adventures the townsfolks' incessant needs would put me on.  Halfway down the path, pure terror struck into my heart as I saw what I had only heard mentioned before in myth -- an abomination, chasing after a 3 foot tall midge... er... gnome.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Completely dumbfounded, I stood absolutely still as I watched this abomination chase the pipsqueak, its three humongous arms flailing about, striking the guy heavily with each blow.  "Just stay still," I told myself, imagining this beast having the mental acuity of a savage dog -- if you run, it will just make him chase you down.  <br/>
<br/>
As I continued to watch the beatdown, the little fella taking him on decided he had enough, and ran off.  I stayed 100% dead still as Stitches began his chase, hoping it would ignore me in its bloodlusty rage to shishkabob the half-pint.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
It seemed to work.  I turned around after Stitches passed me up, to watch the footstool attempt to take on the abomination once again... and was just as successful as the first time (read:  he got his butt whooped.) <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Not feeling particularly suicidal, I ran off towards Darkshire while the speedbump...er.. gnome was busy getting slapped around.  When I arrived, I only was there for about 5 minutes before the Town Crier ran around town yelling "The Abomination has come!  Forward!"<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Now fully healed, and surrounded with a group of fellow adventurers, I decide now's as good a time as any to bite down on the bit and face the beast head on.  We group up and prepare for the fight.<br/>
<br/>
As the gigantic creature barrels down the path to town, we notice his level -- 35+, which means he's an elite creature.  We're talking equivalent to probably level 45 or so as a normal creature.  Whew boy.  Okay.  No time to be a chicken now.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
We try to cut the beast off before he can reach town, our small starting group failing at keeping him contained.  One of the town guardsman notices our plight and runs over, trying to draw its attention by waving his torch and slicing at the gaping hole in its chest with his sword, and is fairly effective at it.<br/>
<br/>
We aren't doing the BEST job at containing the beast, so I do everything I can to draw his aggro (there's that warrior's stupidity kicking in again!) and make it follow me into the town square, where more reinforcements await.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Our groups gang up on the monster and now fully outnumber him.  The Mages begin channeling their powerful spells, the rogues stun and sap the beast, the priests and paladins heal his focused opponent, and the gnomes, well... they're small.  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image10.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image10.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Our assembled squad keeps chipping away at the abomination's health as the 10 or so blades of steel slicing through his thick hide are too much for him to endure.  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image11.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image11.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Finally, the creature falls, and the crier begins running around town again, yelling of our victory... now I know why the innkeeper gives two earplugs free of charge with one night's reservation.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey, maybe the butcher would like some abomination meat to make some Gooey Prime Rib Roast?<br/>
<br/>
Tired and hungry, I sit down to munch on some nasty mushrooms I picked out in the forest, and not having much fun eating oversized forest mold.  A nearby mage looks at my food and shakes his head, and proceeds to summon some stacks of rye and some fresh water -- a welcome treat!  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image12.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image12.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I thank the kind magi, and sit down to eat my bread and water.  The magi proceeds to tell me about a new shipload of adventurers coming from the west, and most of them are arriving at Stormwind.  One of my long-lost friends and fellow adventurers had traveled west to study the divine arts of holy magic, and was never heard of again -- this brought me some hope that perhaps she has returned, so I headed to the capital of Azeroth in hopes that she might be aboard the ship at port, "Phase One."  <br/>
<br/>
I arrived out front of StormWind to see that Kobolds had taken over the place, and as I cut my way through the weaklings, I spotted a familiar sight -- Tscully Kiemon, my friend and fellow adventurer!  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image13.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image13.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
When she sees me, she burst into excitement and we both begin dancing a happy jig of joy!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image14.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040407201632im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal3image14.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
She is new to the continent of Azeroth, and though she has become intertwined with the holy magiks, she has become weakened from the lack of in-combat training.  But still, I know she will soon reclaim her strength and combat skill she once had, and eagerly wait for her to level up her combat ability so we may continue our adventure from times long ago!<br/>
<br/>
This has been a most interesting day to say the least!
