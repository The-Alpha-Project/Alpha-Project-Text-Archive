Today's adventures take us to the wetlands of Azeroth, where many evil things such as orc colonies, merlocs, raptors, dragon whelps, and crocalisks live -- not for the tame of heart or the solo spellcaster! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As I walk down the road to the main harbor, I notice a strange path leading towards the left... and I decide to be a bit adventurous.  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image2.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image2.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
As I head to the left, I run into a dual-weilding dragonmaw raider!  He initializes some sort of attack-speed boost buff and as his hands begin to glow, I begin to get a bit worried!  However, after some timely strikes (high instant damage at the cost of some rage) and a hamstring (reduces movement speed by 75%) I was able to take down the orc without much effort.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I move in a bit deeper into the little niche on the side of the road and reveal what seems to be a plateau of various orc encampments!  ACK!  As a raider and a swamprunner surround me, I have but two options -- flee, or die.  I choose the former!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I use my ability, Intimidating Shout, which forces all creatures except the one im attacking to run away from me in terror for 8 seconds -- while my target is forced to stay intimidated, unable to swing or move, for 8 seconds as well!  This is primarily an offensive ability, used by a warrior to force the head of the group to fight one on one.  However, this time I use it as an escape tactic and run away.  However, I wont be gone long.  The only good orc is a dead orc!<br/>
<br/>
I meet a friendly rogue, while running for my life, named Rooster.  He asks me if I would like to group with him to take on those filthy orcs, and I wholeheartedly agree -- revenge is a dish best served at the TIP OF MY BLADE!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
We move in and begin slicing our way through each mob, one or two at a time, as I skillfully pull stragglers away from the mass of orcs and we slice and dice him in the dark recesses of the valley.  <br/>
<br/>
As we move through the packs of orcs, we come across a little hut overlooking some cliff edge.  Always the eager beaver, I have to have a look. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
After finishing off the two orcs in the camp, we're rewarded with a nice birds-eye-view of an excavation site below.  Just a few hours earlier, I had been on a quest in the excavation site to recover four artifacts... of course, its not just any excavation site full of dirt and bones, but one full of raptors!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
But I digress...<br/>
<br/>
As the gnome and I collect the war flags that we have been asked to provide from the slain orc bodies, I notice my friend Rooster using a peculiar ability that poisoned the orcs, making them extremely slow in both movement and attack.  I inquire about his poison and he tells me that he can imbue my weapon with a temporary poison tip, doing poison damage with each swing!  Im eager to try it out and become quite pleased as the orcs begin to die a stinky death.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
When things start to get a bit too hairy, Rooster uses a really spiffy ability called Sap, which causes the target enemy to conk out for a bit, allowing us to focus on other creatures.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Quite useful when you're trying to focus on one orc and accidentally pull too many!  <br/>
We quickly resume clearing the straggler camps out one at a time, but as we move in deeper to the valley we notice the camps quickly increasing in number and strength, far more than we can handle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image10.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image10.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
We take the flags we've collected back to the keepmaster that had requested them and part, each savouring our rewards.  From up top of the hills during that adventure, I had spotted a dense, dark patch of forest far in the distance, and this intrigued me.  I tossed 3 silver 50 to the gryphonmaster nearby and took the nearest gryphon to Stormwind to find out more about this eerie forest. <br/>
<br/>
When I got there, I learned that it was known as Duskwood, and a man such as myself should always remember to stay to the path, for any wandering could lead to an untimely demise.<br/>
<br/>
To anyone else, this would sound like a warning -- but to me, a challenge!  I ran through peaceful elwynn forest as quickly as able and crossed the covered bridge into Duskwood.<br/>
<br/>
As I walked along the path, I heard a sound, much like hissing but at a higher tone, coming from behind me.  As I turn to look, a GIGANTIC BLACK WIDOW HATCHLING appears and lunges forward!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image11.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image11.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
After a long drawn out battle that nearly cost me my life, I am able to slay the beast, but not without getting poisoned first.  Now I see the need for the warning, as anyone not prepared for combat without the stamina of someone like me would have been slaughtered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image12.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image12.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Now, I happen to have a rather... questionable side hobby.  When wandering through even the densest of evil, whenever I see an interesting or rare herb, I just have to have it.  I will either kill, or sneak, my way into getting these rare herbs, as many friends that are students of alchemy enjoy crafting me various potions and brews with them!  <br/>
<br/>
I spotted a particularly tasty looking flower while running down the path, and despite the warnings and the experience with the spider, I had to pick it!  As I bend down to start picking the herb, something seems to suddenly appear out of nothing... then I realize -- A defias rogue was appearing from the mist, posed for attack, and here I am PICKING FLOWERS!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image13.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image13.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
After a quick fight, realizing that my armor and stamina are too much for her, she decides to flee with but a sliver of essence remaining.  Instead of chasing her down, however, I decide to finish what she was so rudely interrupting -- PICKING MY FLOWERS!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image14.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image14.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
She must have really wanted this flower too, as she comes back at me again after Im finished collecting the harvest.  With one swing, I finish her off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image15.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701072850im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal1image15.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
As I look down the path to Darkshire, I realize that though my training has been long, the quests before perilous, the true adventure is just beginning.<br/>
<br/>
