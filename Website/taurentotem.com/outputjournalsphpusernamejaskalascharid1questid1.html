									  <br><center>Votes: 0 Average Rating: 0</center></b><br><br>Journal, I knew I had not forgotten where you were. It is just that, these past few years I have not been well�.<br />
<br />
I recall it now, the blood and sweat as it poured off us all. I was especially nervous, being just a healer, I kept recalling if I had made the right choice to put myself in the midst of battle. When the time came, I knew what had to be done. My work was fierce with such horrors as I had never seen before. Our fighters kept coming back to us in pieces, and I had to patch them up just to send them out again.<br />
<br />
A time came when no one returned, and we realized then that the battle had reached us. The noises.. � no, the shrieks of the dying were all around us, the walls were shaking, and it was then that I first felt the burning from within. Archimonde had reached us, and left in his wake a burning magic which tortured us all.<br />
<br />
Elune�s grace smiled upon me I suppose, for I felt relieved when the healers came to aide me. Their magic drove back my hunger and for just a moment at a time, freed me of my curse. The healing does not linger however, before long it calls to me. It wants me to search all the lands for a taste of it. What I hunger for is magic, the same magic I was burned with at Mount Hyjal, as well as the magic my Felow priests used to aide me.<br />
<br />
This is why I write today, I am searching Taldressil for that which I seek most. Tallonkai Swiftroot had me seek out a Satyr named Lord Melenas. I was told he could be found in Fel rock, which is known as a vile place. However vile it may be, I knew the stories of dark magic found within fel rock. Tallonkai was pleased when I accepted this task, he will never know how pleased I was.<br />

<br />
The stories we all know of fel rock tell us that it lays north west of Dolanaar, and so I set out into the forest for the first time in what seemed like ages. My natural talent for protection was far less than what it used to be. The magic shields I cast did not prevent all damage from the creatures of the wild, yet it was enough for me to make the short journey. I have much to train in before I am up to my former strength.<br />
<br />
Back on the trail, a fallen log sitting over a narrow canyon caught my eye, yet what startled� no, what captivated me was the sight beyond the log. I stood there staring into the twisted part of the forest. Such corruption could have only been caused by the dark magic of fel rock .In full view of the twisted ground I froze for a moment, wondering why I dared to enter. It was not long before I started to move forward, under the fallen log, and began to bask in the surrounding magic.<br />

<br />
The air was heavy, and reeked of death. Everything surrounding me was twisted a sick color. I found myself looking at my arms to ensure it had not rubbed off. Still I pressed on, knowing I was not capable of turning back before finding what I came for. I was intent on finding whatever magical beasts awaited me.<br />
<br />
Before I knew I was looking into the entrance of fel rock, I noticed two bodies close together. One was a fallen Night Elf, the other a familiar creature of the forest. I ran forward, not knowing if they were alive. As I approached I realized this creature had been tainted. It was not of the sprites I had come to know during my stay here in Taldressil. Something had changed it.<br />

<br />
As I stood there, shocked by my discovery, the sound of faint laugher came from within fel rock. I realized I was not alone, yet I was rash and dashed inside to chase down the source of the voice. As I ran deeper into the cave, the air became even thicker, like a green mist. My heart was pounding, and I did not feel much like myself.<br />
<br />
Running blindly into the shadows, I should have known better. My mistake came to me when I turned a corner to discover a dark sprite casting magic upon me. The blast knocked me backwards, yet strange enough for as much pain as I felt there was also relief. I knew I found the magic I was searching for. The sprite could not have imagined a simple night elf casting a spell back on it, and so it stood in front of me with great curiosity as tore apart its flesh with a mere wave of my hands.<br />

<br />
This noise of battle drew two others into the room, yet they were not sprites, and lacking magic I knew they would not be much trouble. A quick whack with my staff, and a casting upon the other left the cave silent once again. I rested before moving into the inner chamber where I found my Satyr.<br />

<br />
Lord Melenas was guarded by two sprites, not a simple task. Then the idea came to me, to hide behind the corner in the shadows, and cast upon the nearest sprite in hopes of scaring Melenas into sending the sprites in alone. My plan worked, and when the two turned the corner I made short work of them at melee range. Now it was just me and my prey.<br />
<br />
He appeared weak at first, failing to stop the harsh blows of my staff. My magic shield was more than a match for his assaults. Then I realized Melenas was not as simple as I took him for, I noticed movement in the mist and only slightly managed to dodge the claws of creature I did not see before. Once I was distracted, Melenas transformed himself into a beast of terrible strength. The new form he took was so frightening, that the creature I was in combat with fled in terror.<br />

<br />
What ended our confrontation was the limitation of Melenas�s new form. Although I was unable to block many of his attacks, he had to walk on all fours, using a limb that I wounded earlier. His injury left him unable to move fast enough to dodge my final blow. The staff hit him so harshly that I can still notice the marks while writing in this dim light.<br />
<br />
With Melenas slain, and the green mist all around me, I shall take my time before offering proof of my deed to Tallonkai, for I wish to remain here and study what I can of this magic. I only hope I can feed this unbearable hunger without turning into one of these twisted creatures. Only time will tell if I succeed.
