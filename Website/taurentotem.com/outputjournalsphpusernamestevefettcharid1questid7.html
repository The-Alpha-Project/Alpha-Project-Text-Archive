He seemed rather dismayed, and I asked him why he had such a glum look on his face.  He told me about how Silverleaf and Peacebloom, two of his most necessary reagents for his spell, have gone almost extinct due to many of the people from the ship that had just arrived picking them all, leaving none to regrow.  These people, he said, were extremely belligerant, rude, and in many cases, very ignorant about the sensitive world they had arrived to.  He refered to them as "Bnetters," a term I had not heard used since the fall of Lordaeron.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he had asked me if all adventurers start out this way, crass and selfish.  He asked me if there was ever a time when neophyte warriors and alchemists and magi were generally kind, selfless, and helpful.  I told him I had remembered such a time, when personal sacrifice for the good of the team to achieve a goal was on the forefront of the minds of each and every member of the defending force of Azeroth... and that I knew of just an adventure that symbolized that era, one that occured during a time we will henceforth refer to as "BB" -- Before Beta.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the days of my adventures in the Redridge Mountain area, east of Elywnn Forest, I had become attatched to a little town known as Lakeshire, which was of course on the shore of a lake.  Many of the townsfolk paid me well to remove of beasts such as dragon whelps, gnolls, and rarely, the occasional orc -- and the pay was good enough to cause this generally-roaming vagabond to settle in.  <br/>
<br/>
One day a Wanted note was posted on the door of the main hall, asking for the head of Tharil'zun, and to enter the hall and talk to the Magistrate if interested in attempting such a task.  Intrigued, I went inside and asked of the details.  He told me of a stronghold atop a hill overlooking the lake that had been taken over by Tharil'zun and his minions, and of the crimes that he had committed against the people.  I stopped paying attention until he told me of the large silver reward, then I was all for collecting the head of this beast.<br/>
<br/>
I headed off in the direction the magistrate pointed me, up the hill and to the stronghold.  As I surveyed the entranceway, I realized that it would take more than this lone warrior to enter such a bastion.  As I turned to go back to town and gather a force, one of the guards struck me with his axe!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I began to flee, carefully drawing the orc to chase me, which succesfully pulled him away from the rest of the guards.  Once I was clear, I turned around and fought, and quite barely, defeated him.  I returned to town and recruited a task force of people willing to take a share of the loot.  A rogue, Alanon, A mage, Sharkie, and a paladin, Hyrax.  We returned to that fateful bridge and used the same pulling method to attract each of the bridge guards one by one until we were clear to cross the bridge.  <br/>
Once we were halfway across, one of the guards at the other end of the bridge took notice and ran to attack me.  My rogue friend had been wise in going into stealth, as the orc saw only I on the bridge (the other two had been recouperating their mana from the previous combat).  When the orc started attacking me, the rogue snuck around and backstabbed him repeatedly, fatally wounding him.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As I went back to gather the other two members of our party, I spotted another group of adventurers that looked as though they were going to attempt the same quest we were on.  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I inquired about crossing the bridge together and splitting the workload, but they were more than a bit concerned about the elite status (the + symbol by character level) of the orcs, and decided they should head home... hah!  Oh well, I thought, more for us.<br/>
<br/>
We worked our way across the bridge and came to the second of the two guards at the other end, and the power of the four of us combined easily toppled him.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
However, we seemed to have made a bit too much of a racket crossing the bridge, for as soon as we got off of the bridge and onto the stronghold side of the ravine, we were rushed and overwhelmed with orcs!  Unable to hold them all off myself, I called for aide from the Paladin, who quickly healed me and then laid down a Targetting Dummy.  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Oh, man, that dummy was the most hillarious thing I had ever seen.  It was a wooden cutout painted to resemble a man, and was on some sort of bronze gyro that caused it to rock back and forth and wave.  I thought to myself, "What in the King's name is that?  How could that possibly help the situation?"<br/>
<br/>
Then, suddenly, huge blasts of blue light eminated from the thing, and it started making the most horrible noise.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
These blue flashes drove the orcs absolutely insane, and all orcs around us had the overwhelming urge to attack IT instead of US!  Wow, I thought -- that's mighty useful!  While the orcs focused on destroying the insanely annoying device (trust me, it made ME want to turn around and bash it into timber), we cut through the orcs until but one remained... before we could slay him, he was able to destroy the device.  <br/>
<br/>
We took a breather with the entryway clear, and I apologized for leading us into a situation that required him to use such an expensive looking device.  He told me not to worry, and as he gathered the scraps, he told me that he got many of the pieces back to rebuild it.  <br/>
<br/>
After having a quick snack, we snuck deeper into the fortress until we spotted in a courtyard the man we were sent to behead -- Tharil'zun himself!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
He had many friends with him, including two casters, both probably quite advanced in the art of shadow magic -- no amount of armor could protect us from their wrath.  Each monster in there was not only elite, but of higher ranking than any member of our party.  We were most certainly doomed!  <br/>
<br/>
We could have gone back.  We could have been like the previous group, afraid to venture forth, limiting ourselves to slaying spiders and oversized rats and then waltzing into the local tavern like a man on top of the world when we slay some half-dead orc in the middle of the badlands.  But no, that wouldn't be good for any of us.  And we all knew it.  Tharil'zun must die, even if it meant the (temporary) lives of each and every one of us.  I gave my word as a warrior, and as a warrior I would fail or succed!<br/>
<br/>
What happened next occured in far too rapid succession to possibly have been photographically documented.  I attempted to pull one of the guards away to lessen their numbers, but the guard quickly alerted the others, including Tharil'zun, to our presence.  The rogue tried his best to keep the strongest of the guards sapped, but he found them for the most part resistant to his attempts.  We ganged up on Tharil'zun, as typical orcish shamanistic procedure is similar to that of a snake -- only if you cut off its head will the body wither.  We were having limited success on Tharil'zun, as I was directing most of the aggro from the other orcs onto myself with taunts while the paladin healed me.  The rogue and mage focused their efforts on the leader, and just as we were about to lower his health below half, the shadowcasters channeled a spell that put me into some sort of immunity bubble -- I could not be attacked by anything, but I could not attack or move myself.  This no longer allowed me to tank the damage from the more offensive of our group, so the enemies turned their attention to the vulnerable ones.  First, they slayed the rogue, followed by the paladin.  The mage continued his fiery assault, nearly slaying Tharil'zun!  The mage ran away, casting frost nova on his persuers to slow them down, but was unable to get far.  <br/>
<br/>
However, as luck would have it, the guards that chased down Sharkie were frozen into place at the exact moment my invulnerability bubble had dissipated.  Tharilzun, heavily wounded and unable to join in the chase, was left within arms reach of my blade.  I had taken no damage for the last 30 or so seconds of assault while in the bubble, and I was in prime condition, regenerating within my invisible prison, waiting for the moment to strike.  <br/>
<br/>
I lunged forth as soon as I could, and decapitated the orc with one mighty strike.  I threw the head in my satchel just as his guards became unfrozen and barreled down in my direction.  I ran for the edge of the cliff at the side of the clearing in which the battle took place and jumped!  I did not survive the fall, however, my body had cleared the mobs and was in a relatively safe place for retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
However, the same could not be said for my friends.<br/>
<br/>
As I ran to retrieve my corpse, we found out a very interesting thing about these orcs.  They are gifted with some sort of spiritual vision, as they can slay us in our deceased form! (look at the death msgs in chatlog)<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
While I could easily retrieve my body from the cliffside on which I cratered, the other three all lost their lives deep within enemy territory.  This stronghold has but one entrance -- the bridge, as the rest is steep cliffside -- and the guards are too much for me alone.  The other three are unable to sneak past the guards, so I hatch a plan.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702185640im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal7image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Now, I myself could have left by now -- I have my body, I have the head, I could simply disassociate myself with my slain groupmates and turn in my prize.  But I didn't.  I proposed a plan in which I would run up to the bridge and shout taunts at all nearby orcs, drawing them towards me.  While they ran my way, I would absorb their damage for as long as I could while my friends grabbed their corpses from the now-unguarded areas.  When the damage became too much for me to withstand, I would use my Intimidating shout, sending all of them fleeing for eight full seconds (except the one Im targetting, who becomes frozen in place and cannot attack for eight seconds), which would give them enough time to run back across the bridge.  In case of an emergency, they would jump off the bridge into the water below, a good 300-400 foot fall, but it would still get them clear of the ghost-slaying guards.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I apologize for the lack of pictures, but what took place next was nothing short of chaotic.  <br/>
<br/>
The plan was executed to perfection -- I ran up as far as I could and within 10 seconds had 8 orcs wailing on me in a bloodlusted frenzy.  I quickly gulped down a healing potion to absorb a bit more, and as soon as I saw the final groupmate grab his corpse and return to the physical plane, I let loose my intimidating shout.  <br/>
<br/>
I watched as six of them fled.  Yes, there were eight attacking me.  THe other two had resisted the shout, and as soon as they saw the mage, paladin, and rogue respawn, they turned their attention to the other three group members in their weakened post-revived state.  They both seemed focused on the mage, which the paladin took note of and turned on his invincibility spell and ran towards me. The other two were forced to go to the contingency plan and jump off the bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
I turned around from running just in time to watch them fall, and about 8 seconds later, hear both of them die a screaming death.  We had found out via their messy end that the water below was quite shallow and was in fact full of razor sharp rocks.  Also, due to the death count, they weren't the first to meet this fate.  <br/>
<br/>
The paladin and I tried to work our way to their corpses to revive them, but were unable to successfully due to the quantity of orcs in our way.  Once the other two retrieved their bodies, they came to our aid as we tried to fight our way away from the castle.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
With the job done and the villain slain, we each went our separate ways, knowing that we worked together during, and after, the job was done -- and that we had rid the land of another menace.  <br/>
<br/>
Mul took a swig from some bubbling concoction he had sitting near him at the table, letting the story sink in.  "You probably wouldn't hear of such a tale of sacrifice from these new kids nowadays, do you?  You could have deserted them and kept the entire reward for yourself." he said, and I simply shrugged and had a sip of ale.
