<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image1.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image1.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
But after a quick goodbye and a peck on the cheek, I let her know that I must continue on my path through Darkshire to learn more about the ghastly apparitions that dedicate themselves to haunting the innocents of Duskwood.<br/>
<br/>
On my way back to the gloomy village, however, I spotted a mine -- and though picking flowers might be my favourite parttime hobby, I must admit I'm fond of shiny sparkly things too!  And this is a well known copper mine, so i'm intrigued.<br/>
<br/>
I made my way through piles upon piles of measely kobolds... Oh, I remember my youth, as an 8 level-old Warrior, struggling my way through these annoying beasts.  Now, most of them ignore me, as they can tell that Im a manly man of manliness and would slice them into kobold-a-bobs.  I found a really nice <br/>
node of copper, and just as I started to mine, I heard a few growls -- Apparently, these guys really don't like me stealing their copper!  I kept mining anyway, keeping my sword handy to intimidate the little evolved-rats, and suddenly I feel a banging on my back, as if something made of slightly-blunted metal was hitting the shield strapped to my midsection!  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image2.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image2.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Not one, not two, but FIVE kobolds decide to team up on me, and I hear the sounds of fireballs starting up from the hands of Kobold Geomancers behind me.  In total, 8 kobolds are all attacking me at once, angry that im stealing their shiny!  MY SHINY!  SHOO!  SHINY THINGS MINE!<br/>
<br/>
In a fit of rage over them trying to keep me from my copper, I unleashed a thunderclap, heavily damaging the pack of annoying critters and killing a few of the weaker ones. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The pure intimidation factor of the move scares off the rest, and I continued mining the node, making sure to flaunt my newly found copper ore shinies to all the mumbling kobolds that just watch me kick some kobold ass. <br/>
<br/>
I headed back on the road to Darkshire when I passed through another deserted looking town, the town of Moonbrook in Westfall.  The place had been overrun by Defias thugs, and the no-good bandits had taken to looting and pillaging the place to ruin.  Suddenly I remembered the doorman to the Mayor of Darkshire's estate mumbling something about an old schoolteacher from Moonbrook from generations ago, a man called Stalvan. The deceased Stalvan had been spotted by Madame Eva, the mystic from which I got the mystical comb, wandering around Raven Hill cemetary... maybe I could find some sort of clue about his past from the remains of the schoolhouse in which he used to teach, here in Moonbrook?<br/>
<br/>
I snuck in around the Pillagers guarding the deserted village and I found the building that looked like it was once a schoolhouse.  After maiming the guards inside the place, I found a locked box at the foot of the lecture stage, with the name Stalvan inscribed on its lid.  As I bend over to open it, I saw a strange shadowy figure start to solidify as if appearing out of the ether, and looked up to see a ghost, similar to Blind Mary, on the top of the steps!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I could tell that she meant business and wasnt here to have a nice chat.  Before I knew it, I started feeling a strange rumbling in my gut, and blacked out.  When I came to a few seconds later, I realized that the witch turned me INTO A PIG.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I ran around with my tail LITERALLY between my legs, feeling completely helpless as the banshee racked on me with her ethereal claws over and over again.  As I started running out the door, a Defias guard spotted me flailing my furry ass around and started fireballing me.  Figuring this was the end, I thought I would go out in a blaze of glory -- ill try and attack them with my tusks!  Hell, if I was going to become barbequeued pork, might as well try to take one of the two with me.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I suddenly realized that although I had become a boar, I still had all the knowledge and skills as a warrior, minus the intimidating shouts, as obviously the only thing that would come out of my mouth would be loud OINK OINK sounds.  I lunged at the apparition and managed to knock a good chunk of her health off, and kept going at it until she finally vanished back into the netherrealm.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
As soon as she passed back into the plane of nonexistance, I transformed back into my sexy human form, and proceeded to slice the annoying caster into manchunks.  I resumed opening the box and got the hell out of that place, running far, far away -- boy, that was enough to consider going vegetarian. <br/>
<br/>
The note talked about plans to visit a friend in Stormwind, which included a one night stayover in Goldshire.  Maybe the inn would have information, a historical record or something of their visitors from years past?  I could sure try.  The more I know about this guy, the more likely it is I could find a psychological weakness to prod when I finally have to face his undead form prowling the roads of Duskwood.<br/>
<br/>
On the way to Goldshire, I spotted another mine, and, well.... you can imagine what the kobolds thought of my little visit.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
This time I came prepared!  I brought with me some large copper bombs that I had crafted from the copper shiny stuff from the previous mining trip, and blew them all to smithereens!  BOOM! BWAHAHAAH!  <br/>
<br/>
Fire good!  <br/>
<br/>
After blowing up some rats and gathering more minerals, I ran out to Westfall to head to Goldshire and spotted a familiar cute hairdoo!  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Tscully had found her way out here, and was fighting up a storm, slaying the Harvest Machines that the goblins had crafted to scare the redne...err.. farmers into thinking that some mystical harvest demons had come to kill them for tilling their soil and reaping their harvests.  By the looks of things, Tscully must be sweating a bit too much in that skin tight outfit, as she was a bit green and stinky.  I reccomended that she come with me back to town for a nice warm bath and some good food, and we could talk about our adventures over a nice pint of ale.<br/>
<br/>
But Tscully, being the... unique woman that she is, decided that she would bathe herself by jumping off a 50 foot high bridge into a lake. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image10.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image10.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I know what all the guys are thinking... "psh, women."<br/>
<br/>
We arrive at Goldshire, and the inn keeper tells me that a man of that name had been by many years before, and that he had left a locked box in one of the rooms upstairs.  I opened it to discover yet another note, this one was written to a man in Stormwind, and it looked to be some sort of business deal.  I figured I'd check out this guy's place and see just what this humble schoolteacher from Moonbrook was up to, coming all the way to the big city of Stormwind.  <br/>
<br/>
When I arrive, I locate the address the letter was arriving to, and find out that the only survivor of the addressee  was his son, and that all of his fathers stuff was in crates outside next to the canal.  He let me forage through anything I wanted to, and I looked through boxes upon boxes of stuff until I found a dusty looking letter.  I opened it to read it, and before I could get three words into it, the same bit... ghost from before reappeared and TURNED ME INTO A PIG AGAIN.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image11.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image11.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Knowing this time, however, that I can still attack in pig form, I lunged at the annoying spirit and made HER run away from ME.  I mean, seriously, I've heard before that women stay away from me because I was an annoying pig, but this is getting out of hand.  <br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the spell wore off before I could finish her, and I had become human again!  YAY!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image12.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image12.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
And then just as I had become human again, she turned me back into a pig.  Okay, thats it, she needs to die.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image13.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701040516im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal4image13.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
After I slayed her AGAIN, I returned to human form and met up with Tscully, who had been perusing the local weapon shops for a bigger mallet.  (once again, women, psh. always shopping.)<br/>
<br/>
But hopefully these clues about the Legend of Stalvan will piece together and I can find some weakness to destroy the monster, or his exact wereabouts, or something!  I pledged my honor as a warrior to ridding Duskwood of its hauntings, and I don't plan on letting them down.
