While sipping ale in Stormwind, I happened upon a gent that was very unhappy with his current boss and wanted me to fetch some reagents for him to make a special solution that he could slip into his boss's brew.   His reward was a rather tasty sum, so I didn't ask any questions about what the reagents would actually do to this poor soul and took his directions to the two ingredients required and headed out to collect them.  The first was some sort of root at the base of the Dam in Loch Modan -- midget territory!  Damn gnomes.  The dwarves, well, theyre great peoples, but those gnomes... I just don't know.  I have this story about them, and... well... that story can wait another day.<br/>
<br/>
AAAaaaanyway, I arrive at the Dam overlooking the Wetlands to the north of Loch Modan, and climb atop it to bask in its glorious view of the marshes below. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image1.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image1.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The dam is a mighty large construct, but this is not my first visit to this place -- oh no, I've been here before!  I had to rescue it from being blown up by evil iron dwarves in a mission long since passed, and the dwarves that run the establishment along the dam's wall look upon me as their hero for it!  <br/>
<br/>
Well, glancing over the instructions once again, I take a look at the base of the dam from the Loch side, which is a very small distance from where I was.  I just hopped into the lake and peeked around for this root, but found nothing.  I climbed back on top of the dam, and scratched my head... where the heck is this thing?  <br/>
<br/>
I reread the note, and realize that it says the WETLANDS side of the dam's base.  Well, thats a whole different matter.  First off, its quite a ways down.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image2.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image2.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Looking around, I think about what the alternative to reaching the wetlands base of the dam is -- running through the Dun Algaz Gauntlet, a series of tunnels covered in orcs, followed by running from venomous spiders, Animated Oozes, fierce mosspaw gnolls... and suddenly trying to tactfully jump down the various levels of the dam to the dam's bottom doesn't seem so bad. <br/>
<br/>
I spot an edge only about 30 feet below me, and as I scoot to the edge of the dam's top, I think to myself, "Self:  You're a moron" and jump off. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The landing was hard, but not TOO hard, and I sit down for a bit of a breather and have a nice slice of watermellon, and enjoy the view.<br/>
<br/>
That's a long way down.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
From my little perch I spot some hills up against the side of the dam, and I figure... if I can get a good strong running start, I could easily make it to those hills, as they slope downward at a somewhat smooth angle and I could just slide down the wet grass on my leatherpadded bottom... <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I take a deep breath, stick the entire chunk of watermellon in my mouth, and LEAP!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
WHEEEEEEEEE!<br/>
<br/>
As I approach the bottom, I spot a corpse off to the side, and suddenly my jump doesnt seem ike such a great idea...  Someone's obviously tried something similar before, but met an untimely demise.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Phew, landed it.  I look around a bit more for an easy way down and can see that the water isnt too far from being below me!  The little mound im standing on is littered with corpses, but from the angle of their bodies, they must have jumped from the top of the dam -- no wonder they died. :P<br/>
<br/>
I sit down and have a bit more watermellon and a chunk of bread and decide it's do or die time.  Im so close to the dam's base, and this method has saved me easily 10 minutes of running time through lots of mean baddies... its time to take the plunge, and try and land into the lake below!<br/>
<br/>
Im friggin nuts.  But I watched Tscully do this, it cant be that bad!  Right?  Right...?<br/>
<br/>
HERE GOES NOTHING!<br/>
<br/>
I fly off the edge and think to myself, "Im going to make it... Im going to make it!  THe water, I can see the water!  Oh... oh god.  Im not going to make it.  IM NOT GOING TO MAKE IT!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Splat.  Fell short by about 15 feet from deep enough water.  Damn.  My life, ended on some grassy field at the base of a lake.  <br/>
<br/>
I arrive back at the waterfall as a wandering spirit... no wonder the ghosts ive been fighting off are always on a rampage, id be pissed if I had to survive eternity knowing I died like a dumbass, too.  Thankfully, I get to ressurect.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Looking around, its fairly apparent that I'm not the only one that tried this stunt. I take stock of what might be in that water, and come to the conclusion that the only dead people here were sanity-challenged folks such as myself that thought skydiving before the advent of the parachute was a great means of getting around.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image10.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image10.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I ressurect and take a seat and munch on my crushed loaf of bread and thank the Lord of Azeroth for being able to come back to life and redeem myself after attempting such a moronic stunt.  After my post-death snack, I look around for some sort of sign of this weed im supposed to be looking for, and find nothing AGAIN.  Pissed, I sit down and reread the note once more, only this time with a magnifying glass as to not miss a single clue.  I discover that part of the note had been stained by my messy watermellon eating skills, and that the root isnt at the base of the DAM, its at the base of the WATERFALLS a ways from the dam.  A R G H.  I slap myself on the head and decide to swim off my frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
As I was swimming around in the upper lake, cooling off before heading down the hill to the base of the waterfalls below, I swam a wee bit too close to the waterfall and got pulled in by the current!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image11.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image11.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I plunged a few hundred feet down into the smaller lake below, and splashed down without any damage.  Phew.  If I would have died again, I would have been pissed, and probably went and haunted Darkshire or something.<br/>
<br/>
I poke around the base of the first set of waterfalls, and again find no root.  No wonder why this guy's paying so well for finding this thing, you'd have to be nuts to go looking for it.   <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image12.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image12.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Though I have to admit, the views from this area are very spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image13.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image13.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
After enjoying the scenery for a bit longer, I decide to walk down the side of the hills to the base of the final set of waterfalls, and find the root I was looking for.  As soon as I'm done picking it, however, I hear a dwarven shout in the distance -- but it wasnt a happy one.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image14.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040702162033im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal5image14.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Dark Iron Insurgents!  The same ones that planted a bomb on the dam before that was foiled by my attempts many moons ago!  They had shacked up in a cave nearby the base of the waterfalls, and didn't seem to like my presence.  The dwarves were slain without much issue, as Rend does a beautiful job of making things bleed to death.  Such a fun ability.<br/>
<br/>
I know I said I didnt kill anyone except myself in this journal entry, but I lied.  I killed some Dwarves.  Hey, its not my fault, they attacked ME.  I was just picking weeds and roots and pretty flowers.  I swear, flowers always seem to get me in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's one ingredient for this magical brew down, and reading the note, it seems the second ingredient is near a cemetary in Darkshire.  <br/>
<br/>
The same Cemetary that Stalvan was last seen haunting.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight's sleep shall be a restless one with that thought rattling through my brain.
