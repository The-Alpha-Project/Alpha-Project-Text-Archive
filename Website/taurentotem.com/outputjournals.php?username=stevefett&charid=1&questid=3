<br/>
Today's entry starts with a very peculiar quest on which I was sent.  After talking to a fairly... perturbed fellow named Jitters, wandering alone in the deserted town of Raven Hill, he had a strange request from me -- 6 delicious crab cakes from the nearby town of Darkshire. With nothing particularly better to do, I figured I'd take his request as an opportunity to check out Darkshire a bit more in-depth.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got there, I spoke to the chef, who told me, in secrecy, about the special ingredient in his "delicious" crab cakes -- it contains not an ounce of crab, but is instead made with GOOEY SPIDER LEGS.  Yes, Spider Legs.  He told me of his lack of gooey spider legs needed to make Jitters his treat, so he recruited me on a "shopping trip" (read: slicing and dicing critters to get various ingredients.)  He wanted me to bring back a couple of choice slices of wolf flank, some seasonings from Stormwind, and the gooey spider legs for the crab cakes.  Yum.  <br/>
<br/>
I had recalled seeing some fairly easy spiders near the river, and decided that would be where I would collect my harvest.  <br/>

<br/>
After slicing one down, I removed a gooey spider leg (out of the eight, for some reason only one classified as "Gooey."  I have no urge to find out exactly what that "goo" would be.)<br/>
<br/>
I looked south a bit against the duskwood foothills and spotted some of the wolves I needed for the flanks of lean meat, so I went after them as well.  Wolves, of course, are primarily found in packs, so you've got to be able to stand an attack from two of em!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
After a quick trip to Stormwind to pick up some spices from the herbalist, I hopped on one of the gryphons and flew off into the night.  Here I am above the thick duskwood treeline, coming in for a landing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The chef was able to make the gooey "crab" cakes, and as I left to deliver them, I ran into a strange little shack located a bit north of the Raven Hill Cemetary.  Inside was a hermit named AberCrombie... I swear i've heard that name before ;).  He had a task for me, to pick up some ghostly hairs to complete some sort of concoction.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
He gave me some sappy tale about being far too old to walk all the way to town, so out of pity I agreed to pick them up, but first I was going to take a shortcut through the cemetary to bring these disgusting smelling cakes to Jitters.<br/>
<br/>
As I approached the cemetary, my feeling that this was perhaps a bad idea started culminating into pure fear as the sky turned a deep purple and a mist started fogging my vision.  I saw a house, probably the cemetary's procession house or something, and as I approached a foul smelling beast assaulted me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
This was no ordinary foul smelling person, as chunks of flesh were missing to reveal decaying bone, and this beast had a pungent odour that assaulted my senses and caused my strength and stamina to drop.  The fight was tough and I escaped with but 40 hit points remaining.  What a lovely freakin' idea, trying to CUT THROUGH A CEMETARY in a disturbingly evil looking place like Duskwood.  I swear, if my adventurous ideals dont get me killed, my stupidity will!<br/>
<br/>
After that run in I decided to stick to the edge of the cemetary as opposed to cutting through it, and after dropping off the crab cakes I started coming down with a nasty cough that was spreading to anyone I got near!  Looking closer, I had caught some sort of disease, a wandering plague! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I returned to Darkshire to pick up the ghostly hairs that the old whacko in the shack wanted me to pick up, and of course Madame Eva, the shopkeeper, had none in stock.  She gave me a mystical comb, and told me to look for a crazed ghost in a haunted cottage to the south, and have her use the comb to catch some more hairs.  Well, the night couldnt possibly get any more crazy, so I decided to head down the road to this cottage.<br/>
<br/>
The same foul looking beasts from the cemetary were protecting the cottage, but these ones didnt have the same stink coming from them... instead, they seemed to be a bit more decayed, into full skeletons, and these guys were packing swords and blue glowing hands... magi and warriors, I assume.  Well, nothing's gonna keep me from getting into that house, so I take the nearest one head on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I taunt and smack the mage around a bit, thinking hey, this ain't so bad!  Then, suddenly, his eyes begin glowing a piercing green color, his hands start turning blue, and huge chunks of ice start flying at me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The first bolt hits, but I dont allow him to get any more off, relying on my ability Pummel to cancel any charging mage spells, preventing them from even being cast.  Phew, thank god for that ability, as those ice bolts were hitting for 110-120 a shot.<br/>
<br/>
As I cut through the skellies one by one, I finally reach the house.  Expecting to be greeted by a ghastly presence, Im instead greeted by an INSANE GHOUL.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Not just any ghoul, but an INSANE ghoul.  I thought to myself, if this ghoul is insane, that would make the ghouls out there SANE, and those guys were freakin' nuts.  I can only imagine what im getting myself into now.<br/>
<br/>
As I face off against this deep red menace, he casts some sort of spell on me that doubles the damage I take from his attack while dealing only half damage to him!  This is going to be close.  The battle is equal, then suddenly from behind, a Paladin casts upon me a Seal that doubles my damage against the undead!  With this temporary buff, Im able to finish off the Insane Ghoul with only a few HP left... but still, where's the ghost?  <br/>
<br/>
After talking to the Paladin, I learn that I had entered the wrong house, and that the cottage I was seeking was a few hundred meters further south. ARGH.  All that, for nothing!  <br/>
<br/>
I reach the cottage, and of course, there's absolutely nothing evil around it.  Sigh.  I walk in to be greeted by an eerie looking lass floating in the ether:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image10.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701002933im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal2image10.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
She uses the comb and I collect the hair, and return it to madame eva, who then proccesses the ghastly strands and makes the string or whatever the heck it is the other guy needs, and she sends me on my way.  <br/>
<br/>
On the way back to the nutjob in the shack, I come across a path that leads up through a maze of mountains and cliffs in the middle of Duskwood, and my adventurous spirit overcomes my logical thought proccess and I proceed up the walkway, eager to find out just what the heck is up here.  As I get closer to the top of the mountain, I realize that the forest is slowly transforming from the dark evil feel of Duskwood to a more enchanting, magical forest, similar to those ive heard in stories about the night elf enchanted forests of northern kalimdor.  At the top of the mountain, I come across a strange entryway, definately not something forged by man, dwarf, or gnome.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I set up camp outside, and dream of what tomorrow's adventure will yield.
