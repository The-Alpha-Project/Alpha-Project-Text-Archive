									  <br><center>Votes: 4 Average Rating: 5</center></b><br><br>Well, today was all about exploration for Mike the Mage.  First off, I traveled to the great city of Stormwind.  The place is absolutely huge!  I got lost once or twice, but not before finding the Mage Quarter.  I had an intriguing conversation with a high level wizard, and learned of the existence of all sorts of powerful magics.  One day I will use them as well!<br/>
<br/>
I then decided to go for a gryphon ride, and found the only destination available was the great dwarven stronghold of Ironforge.  I paid the modest fee of 50 copper and I was on my way.  I passed through Elwynn Forest eventually found myself flying over a horrid-looking place called the Burning Steppes.  I held on to my gryphon for dear life, and caught a glimpse of some strange creature down below: "Level ?? Humanoid."  By the Gods, what adventures await me!<br/>
<br/>
I landed in Ironforge and did some exploring in the industrial centers in the dwarven homelands.  It was very hot and dirty in there...much to dirty for a wizard.  I exited the city and found myself in the mountains of Dun Morogh.  I spoke with a few NPCs before meeting up with Jim and Tscully.  There is plenty of work here as well.  I spoke with a curious goblin in his forge, just outside of Kharanos.  It seems a local gnome clan has gone insane with disease, and he needs gnomish parts to fix his machine.  He claims his machine can cure them.  Strange.  Jim, Tscully, and I located the gnomes, slew them, and stole their parts.  We received a handsome experience as a reward.<br/>
<br/>
We then traveled to another nearby dwarven town, one plagued by troggs.  There were three separate quests just to slay these monsters.  After some searching, we found Gol'Bolar Quarry, a large mine infested with these monsters.  All sorts of adventurers were already there, engaged in fierce combat, and the ground was littered with the bodies of the unfortunate dead.<br/>
<br/>
We joined up with two more able-bodied warriors, and plunged ourselves into the heart of the mine.  The monsters were EVERYWHERE.  Several times we were pushed back by the trogg hordes, and I found myself twice surrounded, and killed.  After being restored to life, the great warrior StevenFett aided us in our quest, and we were finally able to escape.<br/>
<br/>
After vowing never to engage those brutal monsters in combat (at least until I know a few more spells), we traveled to the dwarven city of Loch Modan.  There, we encountered another gryphon merchant, and received the ability to fly directly here.  We spoke with several NPCs, but my fellow party members were anxious to travel to Westfall.  So we traveled back along the gryphon routes, and back towards our orginal town of Elwynn Forest.  We then traveled directly southwest, and soon found ourselves in dry farmland, Westfall.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed there was no shortage of work to be done there, either.  Goblins were attempting to frighten off the farmers with their threshing machines.  We were instructed to slay 20 of the constructs.  These monsters had the ability to resist my magics!  I found that only my fireballs were capable of reliably damaging the monsters, which makes since, considering they were largely made of straw.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I nearly forgot.  While I was in Stormwind, I encountered two friendly gentlemen on the banks of the canal which runs through the city.  They were quite eager to instruct me in the ways of fishing, at a modest fee, of course.  I purchaesed a fishing pole and some bait from them as well.  Next time, I shall try my hand, and see what I can pull from the rivers and lakes of the world!
