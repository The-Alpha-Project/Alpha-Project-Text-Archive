									  <br><center>Votes: 1 Average Rating: 8</center></b><br><br>Ah, sorry lads. I’m sure you were all waiting anxiously for my next journal entree. I’m afraid I’ve been so busy these past couple of days that I simply didn’t have the time to sit down and write something. Some of the adventures I’ve experienced are just out of this world.... Take this one, for instance:<br/>
<br/>
It all started when, after various adventures in the human region, I finally returned to Dun Morogh. I had many small adventures there and experienced whole new levels of being. As I grew, however, the quests that awaited me grew as well. Soon, I realized I could not continue on my own. I had to take back a step or two, or find some help.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040630235958im_/http://www.druidofthechicken.com/flayer/torch.jpg" align="left"><br/>
Not quite willing to take a step back, I went in search of some companions to aid me in my quest to slay Stonesplinters (who had taken over an excavation site) and recover some of the Carved Idols that were thought to be the cause of their anger. It only took me a few minutes to ask around and soon I found several adventurers who had the same idea, and we were on our way. Right before we started, I asked my companions to hold for a while so I could light up a torch to guide us in the dark paths of the excavation site. This torch also has a more subtle use: the light it provides heightens our spirit and so we regenerate our health and mana points faster.<br><br/>
<br/>
As we entered the site, we were spotted by several of the diggers and they charged us. One was attacking me, while another one tied up our Warlock, stopping him from casting some much-needed spells. Rojak, another dwarven rogue, quickly took steps to get the beasts' attention, and became one with the shadows. When he popped out, the beast was scared to death and tried to escape. However, Rojak had made a huge gaping hole in his skull, and he soon died from the bleeding. Now that the Warlock, named Nilvak, was freed up, the Stoneplitter that was fighting me was quickly finished off with a spell.<br/>
<br/>
A few seconds afterwards, however, we were attacked by a <b>huge</b> Berserker who obviously didn’t feel like letting us finish our meals.<br/>
<br/>

Quickly rising to our feet, we engaged the bastard. He was incredibly strong and really seemed to like attacking me for some reason, but we managed to drive him off, though we were pretty badly beaten up.<br><br><br><br><br/>
<br/>

As the filthy creature ran, however, he called for aid from his companions who seemed to be watching the battle from a distance, and soon we were swamped with a whole group of Stonesplinters.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br/>
<br/>
We fought for our very lives as more diggers appeared and Nilvak was, once again, under siege. Luckily (?!) I managed to hit one of the bastards good with a backstab, and he quickly focused his attention on me. Realizing that this was not exactly something I liked, I cried to our paladin to help me... It didn't take him too long to respond and he quickly cast a Holy Light spell on me. The three monsters that were still remaining, immediately focused all of their attention on him. He was quick to shield himself with a spell, and, when he did, the Stonesplinters focused on Rojak and myself.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040630235958/http://www.druidofthechicken.com/flayer/tyrkas_3_04.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040630235958im_/http://www.druidofthechicken.com/flayer/tyrkas_3_04s.jpg" align="left"></a><br/>
As the battle continued, we finally managed to destroy the Stonesplinters and started our recovery from the harsh battle. What we didn't realize was that from behind a crate, a Geomancer was preparing to cast a spell. Now, this would not be a problem if it was a spell like, say, fireball. But no. This Geomancer has the ability to cast tremendous flamestrikes, which deals significant damage to <b>multiple</b> people.<br/>
<br/>
He hit us pretty bad with his first strike and tied up our Paladin (who was trying to heal the Warlock) and Warlock (who was hurt pretty damn bad by the flamestrike). We rushed up and ran towards the Geomancer, in an effort to prevent him from casting another spell. Us dwarves have some experience with kicking people in the groin, and, luckily, people who cast spells often don't like being kicked there and stop their chanting their spells to make time for screaming in a rage of pain. This is exactly what I did to that Geomancer, and he was quickly taken down by Rolik and myself. While we were tied up with the first Geomancer, however, ANOTHER ONE appeared. My legs were still recovering from the first kick, and Rojak seemed to have missed, so he got off another flamestrike. Luckily this one did not hurt us so bad, as the Geomancer was fairly weak compared to the first one. Through a quick series of sinister strikes, we killed this last Geomancer and looted from it our very last Carved Idol.<br/>
