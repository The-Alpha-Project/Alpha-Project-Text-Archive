<br/>
Our subject for this tale will be an apprentice Paladin who goes by the name Tscully, we join her just as she has finished dealing with a couple of high-ranking Troggs.<br/>
As she searches through her rather full tome of quests, she rests upon one that will lead her to a land she has never seen before, the wetlands. Being the explorative woman that she is, she decides to see what this journey will entail, and so she seeks out the Dwarven mountaineer who will tell her all the details that she will need to know to undertake this task.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
After finding Mountaineer Rockgar rather quickly, she is set a task which she didn't bank on doing until she had improved her abilities to a higher standard. But she also wanted to finally face her natural enemies head to head, and so she decides to attempt this difficult quest. She must traverse Dun Algaz, a land which had been taken from the humans by the vile orc clan 'Dragonmaw' a long while ago.<br/>
A long Dwarven passageway leads her to the start of her journey through Dun Algaz.<br/>

<br/>
As she looks upon the withering Dun Algaz, she remembers her homeland Elwynn Forest, which is probably what <br/>
Dun Algaz would have looked like if it had not been tainted by the orcs. The stench of orcs is almost overwhelming,<br/>
but she has come far from Thelsamar, the nearest friendly town, and has no intention of turning back now. In a brief moment of awareness, Tscully thinks she sees a figure in the distance, it could be orcs or a simple wilderness creature, there was only one way to find out...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Her suspicions were true! A party of 3 orcish scouts were patrolling the path from Loch Modan where Tscully had been sent from. She manages to draw only a single orc away from the party, this will be hard, but not harder than taking on all 3 at the same time. Even though she sees that the orcs are all high above her in terms of combat proficiency, she still attacks, angered by the orcs unlawful presence <br/>
in a land which reminded her so of the fields and trees of the place she originated from.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Alas, as it seems Tscully will slay her opponent, he flees and calls for help from his comrades, who unleash a barrage of flaming arrows from a large distance, things do not look good as she is outnumbered three to one, and also has no ranged attack of her own to counter the burning arrows.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Suddenly remembering the quest at hand, to deliver an important message to the wetlands, Tscully makes a desperate attempt to flee from the orcs down a nearby Dwarven tunnel, which was clearly built before the orcs invaded, due to the worn stone and crumbling floor. Just as she thinks that<br/>
the orcs have given up on their persuit, Tscully is struck with a final flaming arrow through her back, leading to her passing out on the floor, left<br/>
for dead by the orcs.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As she awakens, she realises instantly that she is no longer in Dun Algaz, but back in Thelsamar in Loch Modan, friendly territory! Had she been found by a Dwarven patrol, or rescue party? As she searches in her pockets for her quest log, she finds it is not there, neither is her pocket, or her hand. She was an apparation, a ghost if you will. She suddenly realised that she had died along the passage in Dun Algaz, but is interrupted by a voice which she recognized as the local spirit healer, telling her to return to where she fell, and he would use his vast knowledge of the arcane  magiks to fuse her spirit and body together again, ressurecting her where she died. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703022930/http://www.taurentotem.com/tscullypics/WoW7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703022930im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/tscullypics/WoW7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With haste, she sets off, remembering the way vividly. She passes the place where Rockgar should be, and halts. Had she gone the wrong way? Where was he? It was then she realises that she cannot see anything living, no beasts, no Dwarves. Why should she? She is dead afterall, and with this thought, she again continues along the road to where she fell to the orcs. She passes the place where the battle took place, and presses on to the tunnel. And there, she could see her corpse, untouched. She wondered why the orcs hadn't dragged it away to make an example of it to the other Dwarves and Humans, but is thankful that it is still lying there. Suddenly she feels a great light rising in her, as she beings to become whole again, her hands, her quest log, everything is back, but she still feels weak and drained. A nice sheltered corner in the tunnel and some food and drink later, and Tscully was ready<br/>
to return to Thelsamar, accepting defeat, but vowing to return later when her abilities had increased to match the orcs.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703022930/http://www.taurentotem.com/tscullypics/WoW8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703022930im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/tscullypics/WoW8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
As she flees back to Thelsamar from the tunnel, she is spotted by the same member of the patrol that she was slain by before. With a mighty fist of justice and a swift blow from her mace, she forces the orc to run back to his comrades, buying her enough time to return to the friendly lands of Loch Modan.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703022930/http://www.taurentotem.com/tscullypics/WoW9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703022930im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/tscullypics/WoW9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
As she returns, she views Mountaineer Rockgar, and announces that one day she will return to purge Dun Algaz of the orcs, but that she is not ready yet. Rockgar simply nods, and Tscully makes haste back to Thelsamar, where she is promptly greeted by the Magistrate of the town who tells her about an Ogre problem they have been having.<br/>
<br/>
