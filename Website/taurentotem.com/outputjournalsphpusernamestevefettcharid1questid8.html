<br/>
She told me that the task was clear -- slay Stalvan once and for all, and return his ring to Madame Eva as proof of completion.  She knew of an old cottage in which Stalvan used to keep to himself many years ago and hinted that the house would be his most likely haunting ground, perched on a hill not more than  150 meters from this very spot. I inquired as to why no man had attempted to remove of him before given the fact that his location was so close, and she looked at me with a half-hearted smirk.  "Would you consider yourself a man above  fear?" she asked me.  I told her that the only fear contained within this beating chest was that of failure.  Her smirk dissipated, leaving the outlines of a scowl, as she told me "Within those woods lies beasts whose very SMELL can incite fear, the musky odour known to drive men screaming through the woods, howling like wolves.  Adventurers such as yourself reduced to babbling raving lunat... Ah, well, I'm sure you'll be fine." With that she promptly turned to greet one of her fellow Night Watchmen returning from patrol, leaving me with that thought rattling through my head.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured, "it wouldnt hurt to at least investigate."  I headed down the road towards Stalvan's cottage, and looked upon a rather frightful sight indeed.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image2.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image2.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The smell of their rotted flesh was indeed strong as she had warned me, but there was no more fear in my heart than I had before I took up sword and shield in defense of Darkshire.  I had witnessed things as eery, if not more so, than these bags of withered flesh and hollow bone.  I saw one lone fetid corpse off to the side from the others and figured I would try to cull the herd a bit, taking them on one at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
As I drew my sword and charged at the lone ghoul, aiming to quickly remove head from shoulders, his hands began to glow with a shadowy presence as if summoning some dark conjuration.  Suddenly, an overwhelming stench filled the air and within my brain the only thoughts were to run, scream, flee to the hillside.  Uncontrollably I lifted my arms above my head and began flailing around madly!  I could not control my arms, legs, or even voice!  Whatever this beast had done was driving my body mad with fear, yet leaving my mind unharmed!  Though I could think rationally, my legs simply wanted to run, run far away, as my throat bellowed the moans of a madman!  WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME!  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image3.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image3.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
When I finally regained control of myself, I was over 200 meters from the site of the house and the ghoul had broken off its chase.  Now I realized why Stalvan was able to rest in his cottage unassaulted  -- his pets out front really COULD drive any adventurer insane with fear, the body's only reaction to run as far away as humanly possible before the stench would dissipate enough to be able to regain control.<br/>
<br/>
As I walked back to the cottage, I figured I'd try a bit more of a stealthy approach this time.  I hugged the walls of the house, trying to avoid the undead servants out front.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image4.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image4.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
With my back to the wall, I crept towards the entry way and was finally able to sneak in.  The cottage  was empty!  I couldn't believe it, as I looked at the back wall searching for some sort of clue, perhaps a secret entryway to a tunnelsystem below or something.  As I was rummaging through the broken  furniture on the ground, suddenly I heard a voice from behind me mutter "Who dares disturb me?  DIE!" <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image5.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image5.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Stalvan Mistmantle!  Across his forehead he bore the marking of the Raised, undoubtedly ressurected via some sort of shadowy magiks.  I raised my sword to strike him, but before I could land my blow, he cursed me with a vexxing which made me feel incredibly weak -- my blow landed softly, my arm unable to sustain the strength with which the sword was raised.  I paniced -- I knew I wasn't going to be able to take him on alone.  I did the first thing that came to my mind -- I ran.<br/>
<br/>
As I fled out the door, one of the ghouls out front spotted me and released his stink upon me once again.  Though I sighed inside, all that came out my throat was the same rantings and howls as before --  "OH GOD GOD OH GOD AHHHHEHAHAHAHAH WOOOOOOOOOOOOO" as my hands flailed about in the air and I ran circles around the beast, and when I was able to finally regain control I was upside down in the fountain in Town Square, the entire city staring at me wondering what had driven this warrior to bathe himself in the Darkshire Plaza.  <br/>
<br/>
As I dried off in the tavern, I caught news that Tscully, my dear friend, would be joining me from the  North -- though she was too weak to be here alone, I figured that if she stayed by my side, she could assist me in slaying some of these foul beasts that haunt the lands.  Maybe with her holy magiks we could overcome the fear daemons, and if we could increase her combat acuity, we could face Stalvan together... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I went out to meet her down the road, she was being chased by a beast that resembled a wolf, yet ran on its hindlegs.  Curious, I thought... as it got closer, I realized that this beast, though animal in appearance, had humanoid attributes -- a lycanthrope!  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image6.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image6.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
We fought the beast, Tscully's healing and cleansing abilities a welcome depart from me having to rely on my own stamina to outsurvive the creature's blows.  She cast upon me a seal of might, and I felt a renewed vigor flow through me and struck down the beast with one Overpowering Strike.  <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image7.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image7.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
The beast fell forward onto the grass, and we exchanged belated greetings.  As we sat upon the hillside, eating some rye and enjoying spring water to rejuvinate our strength, I heard a rumbling in the woods below.  Suddenly, one of the same beasts appeared, but this one looked different -- its wounds deep, as though it had been through many fights before.  <br/>
<br/>
It lunged at Tscully first, and with its back to me, I unleashed a Power Strike, a blow so fierce that the beast has no choice but to turn and face me for six seconds regardless of any other actions around him.  I unleashed two savage blows to its head, but it bit into me with its teeth laced in a venom that made my wounds burn as though a fire was in my blood.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image8.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image8.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
However, with our combined might of the Light of Azeroth and the strength of my steel, the beast fell.  We resumed our breakfast that the creature had so rudely interrupted, and Tscully told me of her adventures -- fighting the Harvest Watchers in Westfall, dueling with Troggs in Loch Modan.  In the midst of her tale against the Ogres of the Loch, a trumpet sounded in the distance, near the fork in the road. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image9.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image9.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
A gathering!  But why would they be gathering here, in the middle of the road in Duskwood?  Swords drawn, torches lit, but a fear seemed to resonate throughout the group -- Ive seen this before.  But where?  In the distance, near the entrance to Darkshire, I could hear the faint howl of the Town Crier.  "The beast approaches!  A gift from the Embalmer!"  <br/>
<br/>
Stitches.  <br/>
<br/>
But how?  We had slain him before.  How was it possible that he had returned?  I approached one of the guards about this, and he told me that the lore about the Reanimated one was that though it bore the same name, it was not the same creature entirely, but a collection of decaying remains and magical enchantments.  <br/>
<br/>
I drew my blade, and for some unexplainable reason, Tscully was EXCITED to finally face the mythical Stitches.  Though any man would be soiling his armor at the thought of one ton of reanimated flesh barreling down at him, three arms flailing about weapons of unimaginable pain, she wanted to slay him HERSELF.  Crazy, crazy woman, I thought to myself, but then I realized this is the same lass that jumps off of sheer cliffs to bathe herself.  <br/>
<br/>
Women.  <br/>
<br/>
As we saw the gigantic, ominous shadow approach, we held our ground, waiting to strike it as one group.  The healers began their prayer chants blessing us with holy strength, and we prepared ourselves for the encounter -- sharpening stones, weighting stones rattled against sword and mace alike.  When the beast became visible, its gaping maw shaking the very earth with its deep belches and moans, something began moving in the corner of my eye.  Tscully was running ahead, sword and shield armed, to fight it head on! <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image10.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image10.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
I yelled at her to get back, back within the safety of the group!  But I was too late.  One mighty strike from the beast's cleaver, followed by a swing of its chain brought her down to her knees.  Before I could throw myself in front of the abomination's sickle, she was struck down, her soul released.  <br/>
<br/>
Fighting off the rage that her (temporary) demise had built up inside me, I ran back to the group and rallied them to charge!<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image11.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image11.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
We fought it head on, but as the battle commenced, many of the weak willed among us fled in the heat of combat!  Our numbers dwindling from those intimidated by its gaping wounds and massive arms fleeing to safety, we could no longer hold off the beast.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image12.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image12.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
We agreed to retreat closer to the town where we could gain more of a numerical advantage over the creature.  As we fled, the beast was unable to keep up with us, so we knew we would have time to regroup and try once again to hold it off. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image13.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image13.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
Our reformed group approached the beast again, and luckily enough those of us that reformed each had the willpower to see the beast to its doom -- no one fled, knowing that the healers would keep our stamina and vigor up long enough to allow our groupmates to draw the beast's ire so that they could fully recover and then attack again.  This equal distribution of blows kept us together, and our blades combined were enough to slay the abomination once again.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent the creature from reanimating further, someone came up with the idea of spreading the enchanted remains among the various graveyards of Duskwood.  Of course, they left me with this task.  Not wanting to see further harm come to Tscully knowing that she was not ready for the ghouls and demons that lurk along these lands, I bid her farewell, assuring her that our paths would cross once again.  I took the bloody satchel upon my shoulder and walked to the Raven Hill Cemetary to begin this foul job.  As I laid the sack down, I noticed two other people with shovels in hand, digging a grave site.  <br/>
<br/>
Strange, I thought.  Two women, alone in this haunted graveyard filled with the living remains of warriors long since passed, digging a grave in the middle of the night.  I watched them from a distance, curious, when I saw one of them jump into the hole... she re-emerged a few seconds later with a necklace in hand!  They weren't burying, they were stealing!<br/>
<br/>
I approached them to place them under "citizens arrest," if you will -- as I approached the one with the necklace in hand, I let the other slip out of my sight, which was quite costly.  As I asked what she was doing, the one that disappeared struck me across the helmet violently with her shovel, giving me quite the headache.  <br/>
<br/>
This pissed me off pretty handily.<br/>
<br/>
I initiated my Inner Rage, generating a massive amount of additional rage to draw upon, and attacked the two thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image14.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image14.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
One fell to the might of my blade rather quickly, while the other decided she'd make a run for it.  I gave chase deeper into the graveyard, and suddenly I was jumped from the side by a Skeletal Horror!  I decided it might be a wise move to turn my focus from the shovel-baring woman to the walking armor-clad skeleton weilding a sword, and parried his next blow.  I threw a couple of strong strikes to his midsection, trying to snap his spine in two.  Unexpectedly, the creature threw back its head and let out a mind-numbing howl that burned within my brain like searing needles.  Then, my legs began kicking and flailing about, my arms raised into the air... all I could think to myself was "no, not again.  NOT AGAIN, for the love of the King!"<br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image15.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image15.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
With both arms raised high above my head, my body once again began to buckle under the Fear Spell that these undead seem to love to unleash.  I ran around like a chicken with its head chopped off, screaming undecipherable phrases and laughing the laugh of a madman as the skeletal warrior gave chase.  Eventually it got bored of chasing and decided to just watch me run around frantically, uncontrollably... I eventually came to a stop as my body decided that it would ignore the tree in front of me, sending me head first into its mossy trunk.  <br/>
<br/>
When I finally came to, three men were huddled around me, trying to wake me up. <br/>
<br/>
<center><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image16.jpg" width="650"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040703015727im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/myownpics/journal6image16.jpg" width="650"></a></center><br/>
<br/>
 Mordyn, Loengard, and Maltrok introduced themselves to me as they handed me some spirits to help numb the pain.  They told me of a cave full of ogres that they were interested in exploring and were looking for another likeminded (read:  insane) person that would like to join them on their quest.<br/>
<br/>
I figured I'd join in, as I could use a rest from fighting these damned undead (no pun intended.)  We finished our food and drink and turned in at our camp outside the entryway to the cavern they were so interested in investigating, and I slept quite well -- the constant arm-flailing and running of today's activities tuckered me out, I suppose.
