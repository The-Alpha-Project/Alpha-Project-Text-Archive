									  <br><center>Votes: 5 Average Rating: 8.2</center></b><br><br><b>First Night-Elf Adventure</b><br/>
<p>My character Sharis, a Night-Elf Warrior, begins her adventure in the land of Shadowglen.  This default Night-Elf location is home to a small city-tree named, "Aldrassil."  The tree has a building at its base, allowing access to the various class-trainers and merchants within.  A stairwell spires up from the base of the tree, enveloping it and leading to more trainers and quest NPCs.  The leaves around this ancient glen are toned purple, as is most of the scenery.  The first thoughts in Sharis' head? "Holy Crap!"</p><br/>
<p>Sharis is your basic warrior.  Warriors, unlike casters are not built around the fear of drawing attention, but instead focus on the aspect of "killing the hell out of stuff."  The expression used by some of my college friends for this is "fight like bacon."  I don't ask.  Warriors use rage, a type of mana like rating built up by attacking things.  This rage is then used to power abilities. The basic ability allows her to deal a strike to an enemy for more damage than she would normally do.  Sharis suits up into her starting level gear and heads off to her first WoW adventure in the land of Shadowglen.</p><br/>

<p align="left">Ahead of Sharis lies her first NPC, a Night-Elf Conservator with an exclamation point over his head.  The conservator wants Sharis to slay some basic starting level monsters.  In exchange, I get some groovy gloves and copper pieces, "Sure."  Apparently he wants me to protect nature by slaughtering it whole-sale.  Works for me.</p><br/>
<p align="left">Copper is the fundamental unit of money.  With copper you can buy basic goods.  100 copper leads to one silver, which leads to one gold.  Around level five or six you'll get into silver, then around seventeen to twenty you get into gold.  Gold allows you to buy good items in the current beta level 30 cap economy.  Silver is decent as long as you are below level 17.  I also need armor. I'm a warrior and and that item would, at the time, double my armor rating so I can take more damage.  Good stuff.  This is one of several types of missions, but the kill missions are generally the quickest and best rewarding, so long as you are the right level for the job.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_203820.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_203820.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">The thing is boys and girls, I'm a greedy sonuvabitch.  I don't just want one quest, by damn I want two.  Why waste my energy getting one done when I could do two at the same time?  Nonsense.  So I go searching around for another person to give me a quest and lo', LO AND BEHOLD, I find one.  Literally a minute into looking, how great is that? Staghelm wants me to talk with a dryad, a standard exploration mission.</p><br/>
<p align="left">You see, not only do quests give you items, monies, and glittery things.  The best source of experience in World of Warcraft is most definitely questing.  Sure you can train your character in certain areas of the game to gain a particular level, but those opportunities don't occur too much.  WoW would be nothing without it's really good questing system.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_203917.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_203917.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">Sharis is a newbie warrior, so the first thing I should do is scout my newbie area.  I enter Aldrassil's village-house at its base to find my trainer.  Sharis locates her in the back of the Aldrassil building, a nicely armored and petite Night-Elf female.  Class trainers train you to learn certain abilities so you can go kill things dead.  Starting-level trainers only teach abilities up to level 10.  No staying in the same starting zone for you.  These abilities cost money to learn and are only available once you reach a certain level.  Starting trainers only offer rank 1 abilities.  Later, advanced trainers can upgrade your ability ranks to deal more damage, heal more, ect for a price (again, once you reach the right level).</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204054.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204054.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">So what do I do?  Naturally I go out to slaughter, maim, and kill poor animals who are minding their own damn business and certainly have no right to in a game called "Warcraft."  They must be punished for their pixelated stupidity.  Most of these creatures drop pelts, good for both selling (so I can buy better armor) and as craft-items.  As you<br/>
fight, proficiency statistics increase.  Sometimes when you get hit, your defense increases.  When you hit something, you skill with weaponry or special attacks will go up.  Though these stats aren't listed, they are important since they deal with accuracy.  </p><br/>
<p align="left">These animals are yellow, meaning they won't attack me until I attack them first.  The first quests of starting areas involve yellow text-color creatures so newbies won't be in fear during their first gaming experience.  Mmmm, slaughterific.  I likes to kill animals. </p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204159.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204159.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">A neat feature: when you kill a creature or obtain a quest item, it will flash how many you have and how many you need to complete the quest.  Good stuff.  Each starting creature takes a small chunk of my life while I kill it, making early combat pretty quick.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204303.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204303.jpg" width="650"></a> </p><br/>
<p align="left">So while I was questing, I gained a level.  It's easy to level early, the first 5 levels come almost immediately.  When you level up, you are allowed to increase your character's statistics through use of "talents."  Talents cannot be unlearned.  Sharis decides to split her talents between stamina and strength.  Each level I'll alternate the two.  Each point of stamina ups Sharis' hitpoints by 20.  Each point of strength allows you to deal more damage.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204416.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_204416.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">The Dryad asks you to collect Fel Moss from Grells.  Grells are goblin-like creatures who seem to prize their treasure.  The Fel Moss quest is your typical collection quest, kill monster to get items they drop.  The problem in later levels (7+) is that areas tend to be camped.  And, on top of that, items don't always drop, these are generally the longest missions spanning several hours.  Very unfun but "ok" since I'm at such a low level.</p><br/>
<p align="left">At this point I have the ten copper needed to purchase my first skill, Battle Shout.  Shout allows me to boost the damage of myself and party members for two minutes.  It costs more rage than my starting level ability, but is also more handy as it effects every monster I attack for the next two minutes.  For only ten copper, it is most definitely a worthy<br/>
purchase.</p><br/>
<p align="left">I found a chest guarded by Grell.  I thought that since they were yellow-text creatures I could just open it.  Is it ever that simple though?  The little bastards swarm me and I run away like a sissy-girl.  A cloaked rogue runs around stealing from the pockets of the Grell, which does not take away from the killing award.  Then he slaughters them within seconds.  Rogues are very overpowered at this phase of the test.</p><br/>
<p align="left">After making a meatfest out of the Grell and the passive animals, the Conservator gives another quest with slightly more advanced enemies.  Same thing basically, a newbie quest to acclimate the players to the Night Elf lands and the game.  This time he gives a choice between cloak or belt, I go belt.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_211850.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_211850.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">I sell 10 ruined pelts for 50 copper and buy some decent armor.  I can now at least absorb a decent amount of damage.  Though I wish I didn't have to sell my pelts since they could be handy later on, I sell them anyway, I need more armor points now.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_212858.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_212858.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">I find another NPC on the east side of Aldrassil looking to give away quests.  This one wants me to get spider venom sacs so he can dissect them, yum.  Sharis sets off yet again to kill the aggressive spiders who have no problem attacking and ganging up one poor newbies.  Luckily I'm now<br/>
equipped to slaughter them all.  </p><br/>
<p align="left">So I head north towards the entrance to the spider cavern and then proceed to do what I do best: smash things good.  The Webwood Spiders don't drop gold, meaning I'm going to be poor after this (unless I sell their limbs), but it's good experience and I need it to progress in my quests and gain much needed experience.  So I collect the sacs.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_213337.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_213337.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">So I bring the venom sacs back to the inquisitive Night-Elf, so how does he thank me (other than my reward)?  He gives me another quest!  This time I have to go into the spider cave and steal one of their eggs.  Most starting races have a "go into this cave" quest towards the beginning to say, "Welcome to dungeon-crawling."  </p><br/>
<p align="left">I can chose between a tunic or a shield.  I chose to take the shield since I'm using the default shield.  I'd be getting more armor out of the shield than by taking the tunic.  Always pay attention to this detail as a warrior since you have access to almost all items.  Into the cave Sharis goes.   </p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_213836.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_213836.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">The dank cave is filled with spiders, not well lit and a little creepy.  Sharis gave me I look, I pushed her on.  I'm the one with the cursor.  Had I not gained my levels up to four, I would have been slaughtered.  Progressing through the area, I pick off spiders one-by-one.  These ones have a poison that drains my health.  This poison can kill me, it does more than just reduce hit-points to one.  At one point I was double-teamed, I survived with very little life and was<br/>
poisoned, so I resorted to food.  Food is a type of consumable item that restores hit-points fairly quickly.  The only drawback is that you have to be sitting down and out of combat to use it.  Unless you're playing a healing class, food will be your very best friend.  So I have some ribs.</p><br/>
<p align="left">At the end of the cave lies two enemies a basic spider and a unique one, Githyiss the Vile.  Githyiss is a higher level than me, so I attempt to kill him first.  Sadly a rogue beats me to the punch and backstabs him before I have the opportunity to attack the unique spider.  I kill the generic one.  Luckily this dungeon (unlike some later ones) has<br/>
plenty of quest rewards for everyone.  I encourage the newbie-friendliness of the beginning quests, but I wish the later quests were equally friendly by providing items for all group members.   </p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_214606.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_214606.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">Now that I have attained level four, I can purchase new skills from my trainer, Charge and Rend.  Charge allows me to engage enemies quickly and build up my rage bar faster.  Rend allows me to deal additional damage.  I prefer Charge, but cannot afford either at the time.  So I go back to finish the quest by talking with the NPC.  I'd really like those<br/>
skills, but I don't regret getting items instead.  I can always just get more copper later but the armor saved me while I was in the cave, that's enough to convince me.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_215041.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_215041.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">I head back to the trainer.  He informs me that my exploits have become renowned and that the leader of the Aldrassil outpost, Tenaron Stormgrip, wishes to speak to me.  Sharis climbed up the stairwell. Halfway up is a house built into the tree, inside that house are the hunter and druid trainers, quite desolate.  Blizzard knows they're not in yet.  A<br/>
short ways more up the tree is another house which houses Tenaron Stormgrip.  Apparently the World Tree did not fair well at the end of Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos.  Looks like it's time for this Night-Elf help save her society.</p><br/>
<p align="center"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_215505.jpg" width="650"><img border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20040701132432im_/http://www.taurentotem.com/Jim/images/WoWScrnShot_032704_215505.jpg" width="650"></a></p><br/>
<p align="left">What next?  What does the future hold?  Will Sharis help to save her people?  Will Batman get it on with Catwoman?  Only time can tell.</p><br/>
