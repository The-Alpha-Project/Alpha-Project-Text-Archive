<p>When creating a character, after choosing a race, the next thing a player will choose is a class.  A character's class determines what skills and spells he or she will have.  There are a total of nine base classes available.  In addition to the base class, around level 60 or so each character will be able to choose a Hero class, which will provide further specialization. As Blizzard releases additional information regarding hero classes, this section will be updated.</p>

<p><b>Druid</b></p>
<p>Druids are the keepers of the world. Locked in slumber for generations, they awoke to meet the threat of the Burning Legion during its recent invasion. After Archimonde's defeat, the Druids chose to remain in the waking world and help to rebuild their shattered lands. The Legion's attack left a terrible scar on the natural order, and the Druids seek to heal it.</p>

<p><b>Hunter</b></p>
<p>Azeroth is home to a wide variety of beasts. From the new world of Lordaeron to the old world of Kalimdor, all manner of creatures can be found. Some are friendly, some are ferocious and aggressive - yet they all have one thing in common. Each creature shares a special connection with Hunters. Hunters track, tame, and slay all manner of animals and beasts found in the wild. Whether they rely on bows or firearms, Hunters consider their weapons and pets to be their only true friends.</p>

Wielding their mighty hammers and the strength of the Light, these holy warriors command forces in battle, all the while throwing themselves to where  the fighting is the thickest.</p>

<p><b>Priest</b></p>
<p>Priests lead the  many faiths spread throughout the disparate lands of the world of Azeroth. In  Kalimdor, Night Elf Priestesses revere the moon goddess Elune, while Dwarven  priests in Khaz Modan deliver the message of the Light to their people. In the  ruins of Lordaeron, the undead priests of the Forsaken, their faith twisted and  tainted by their tortured existences, spread a dark interpretation of the Holy  Light. Regardless of their faith, however, all Priests share in their ability to  manipulate the minds of those who turn to them for spiritual guidance.</p>

<p><b>Rogue</b></p>
<p>At home in the shadows and skilled at disappearing from sight, the Rogues of Azeroth are most comfortable when acting in the background. Twisting events to their favor,  striking only when advantage is greatest: this is where a Rogue excels. With  their cunning tricks, physical abilities, and mastery of concealment and disguise, Rogues have no trouble finding employment as thieves, cutthroats, spies, and assassins.</p>

<p><b>Shaman</b></p>
<p>Shamans are the spiritual leaders of their tribes and clans. They communicate with spirits, have visions of the future, and guide their people through the darkest of times. Many mistake their wisdom and serenity for a pacifist nature. When challenged, though, shamans have a range of powers available for dealing with threats to the natural order.</p>

<p>Warlocks were mages that delved too deeply into the roots of demonic power. Consumed by a lust for dark knowledge, they've tapped into chaotic magics from beyond the world. The Burning Legion now feeds them their powers, allowing them to channel destructive energies and call upon the powerful emissaries of their demon masters.</p>
