                        and the Undead, arguably the most fascinating race in 
                        World of Warcraft (with the Night Elves), and one of the 
                        most original class in the game.</font></p>

                        the Undead:</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                        If you haven't played Warcraft III, now is the right time 
                        to tell you a little more about the Undead. Two Undead 
                        factions are present in World of Warcraft. The Scourge, 
                        led by Prince Arthas, and the Forsaken, led by Sylvanas.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                        an Elf, Sylvanas was transformed into a Banshee by Arthas. 
                        After unwillingly serving Arthas for a while, Sylvanas 
                        gained her freedom from the Scourge and since that day, 
                        seeked revenge against the Scourge, and the Alliance who 
                        let her down.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                        Forsaken have signed a treaty with the Horde, composed 
                        of the Orcs, the Trolls, and the Tauren. This pact is 
                        however just a means of survival for the Forsaken, who 
                        ultimately want to create a new plague that will destroy 
                        whoever lies in their path. Nobody can clearly tell how 
                        the pact between the Forsaken and the Horde will last.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                        Forsaken reside in Lordaeron, once the proud Human capital. 
                        But what was once a prosperous kingdom is now only populated 
                        by demons, ghosts, and other creatures who only live to 
                        destroy each other. Amongst all enemies, two factions 
                        have for goal to obliterate the Forsaken: the Scourge, 
                        who cannot tolerate any dissidence within its ranks, and 
                        the Scarlet Crusade, a Human faction who wants to regain 
                        control of Lordaeron, and purge the world from any Undead 
                        presence, be it Scourge or Forsaken.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">About 
                        the Rogues:</font></b> Rogues are powerful fighters that 
                        can be characterized by their ability to inflict heavy 
                        damage and their capacity to hide, using their stealth. 
                        However, Rogues are restricted to cloth and leather armors, 
                        which means that they do not have a very proper defense, 
                        even if they are allowed to equip a basic shield. After 
                        proper training, Rogues can become almost invisible, and 
                        can also double-wield.</font></p>

                        had lasted a little longer, you would have been buried 
                        with those who didn't succeed in gaining their Undead 
                        status. As every &quot;soul&quot; counts, you are immediately 
                        prompted to serve the Dark Lady, and sent to your first

                        spirits that the Forsaken cannot control, getting some 
                        needed elements such as animal paws and wings, and eventually

                        Warriors who depend on rage, or casters who depend on 
                        mana to use their skills, Rogues have an &quot;energy&quot; 
                        bar, which allows them to use their own abilities. Rogues 
                        start with two skills: <b>Sinister Strike</b> and <b>Eviscerate</b>. 
                        For those familiar with Diablo II, Eviscerate is a finishing 
                        strike, which means that it can only be casted after another 
                        skill. The next available skill is Stealth, which can 
                        be acquired at level 2. </font></p>

                        Stealth is a lot of fun, especially when you crawl near 
                        people who don't expect you. As seen on the right picture, 
                        it is very difficult to see a Rogue using stealth. However, 
                        stealth does not provide total invisibility, especially 
                        if you are moving in front of a target. Stealth comes 
                        with its own skill bar and a few skills that can only 
                        be used under stealth mode. Stealth is the best way to 
                        use your Backstab skill.</font></p>

                        a letter in your bag that tells you where you can find

                        By selecting all possible quests, you will avoid having 
                        to run back and forth between the NPC and the quests area.

                        but also the Trolls, Orcs, and Tauren quests. This is 
                        important to know when you find out that quests are becoming

                        Forsaken outpost. There, several NPCs offer quests against 
                        the Scarlet Crusade or the Scourge. One even asks you 
                        to test a potion on a Human prisoner to transform him 
                        into an Undead. Brill offers an Inn, important for the 
                        rest system, class trainers (mostly in the Inn), and trade 
                        skills trainers. There, you will find a Herbalism trainer, 
                        an Alchemy trainer , and an Enchanting trainer. Both Alchemy 
                        and Enchanting require herbalism as a prerequisite. Other 
                        trade skills are available further away from town, such 
                        as tailoring. All trade skills require skill points that 
                        you acquire through combat experience (not from quest 
                        experience). </font></p>

                        Although most quests are found on NPCs, some are found 
                        on some signs. These signs usually offer a reward for 
                        killing a named mob. This kind of mobs usually have a 
                        &quot;+&quot; sign behind their name, which means that 
                        they are much harder to kill that their indicated level. 
                        The picture on the right describes one of these quests. 
                        Note that, unlike NPCs, signs do not give you any clue 
                        that they have a quest ready, either now or for higher 
                        levels. You will have to revisit the signs after you level 
                        up to see if it is linked to a quest.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">Quests 
                        around Brill are harder than those you found in the training 
                        area. The first reason is that now, most mobs (with red 
                        names) do not wait for you to attack them. Get close to 
                        them and they will directly attack you. Also, and contrary 
                        to what you could find in the training area, most mobs 
                        are now at least at the same level you are (you should 
                        leave the training area around level 4, after completing 
                        all quests there). Finally, while our Rogue can deal some 
                        good damage, he is still restricted in his choice of armor, 
                        which is his weakness in melee combat</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                        in other regions, you will need to either kill some mobs, 
                        or collect some items on them, then return to the NPC 
                        who gave you the quest, unless otherly specified. The 
                        easiest quests around Brill involve stealing pumpkins 
                        in a farm that is still defended by some Human farmers 
                        and Scarlet Warriors, or getting some paws from Undead 
                        faithful to the Scourge. After completing a couple of 
                        these quests, our Rogue will have enough skill points 
                        to select at least one trade skill. I suggest herbalism 
                        (10 skill points), which will lead you further on to either 
                        enchanting (creation of potions), or alchemy (enhances 
                        items). Another useful trade skill combination for a Rogue 
                        is skinning and leathercrafting.</font></p>

                        money (yes, if you didn't know it already, training requires 
                        some financing). In World of Warcraft, most skills have 
                        several levels, and it is important to update these levels, 
                        as they bring more power to the skill. A level-1 Sinister 
                        Strike might have worked fine against level-2 or level-3 
                        Zombies, but will not do too much damage against a level-10 
                        Scarlet Zealot, or not fast enough to keep you alive anyway.

                        Finishing Skills:</font></b> Understanding the concept 
                        of Finishing Skills is very important for the survival 
                        of a Rogue. If you have played Diablo II, these skills 
                        were introduced with the Assassin and the Druid. Basically, 
                        a finishing skill is a skill that requires another skill 
                        before it can be used. The more &quot;prerequisite&quot; 
                        skills (such as Sinister Strike or Gouge) you &quot;stack&quot;, 
                        the more powerful your Finishing skill will be. A good 
                        combination at level 8 is Sinister Strike, then Gouge, 
                        then Eviscerate. As you will have casted two prerequisite 
                        skills before Eviscerate, it will generate between 29 
                        and 39 damage points (only 17 to 27 if you had only used 
                        one skill before Eviscerate). You can also decide to repeat 
                        the Sinister Strike- Gouge combination another time before 
                        casting Eviscerate, which would then inflict between 53 
                        and 63 damage points.</font></p>

                        speed. Like other finishing moves, Slice and Dice's effectiveness 
                        depends on how many prerequesite skills you use before.

                        protection level is not high enough to effectively give 
                        a defense advantage to the Rogue.</font></p>

                        hope this &quot;Introduction to the Rogue will help you 
                        better understand a very good class to play. Although 
                        it requires a little more management than other classes, 
                        because of finishing moves, it certainly brings a lot 
                        of originality with the use of stealth and options such 
                        as pick-pocket. If you would like to learn about other
