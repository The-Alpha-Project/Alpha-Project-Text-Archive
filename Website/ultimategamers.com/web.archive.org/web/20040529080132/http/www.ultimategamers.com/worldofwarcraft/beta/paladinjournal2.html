                        part of this journal was a presentation of the different 
                        elements that every player who creates his or her first 
                        character will face, as well as some highlights of the 
                        new player zone. This time, my Paladin is ready to face 
                        the &quot;real&quot; world and interact with its dangers. 
                        This article will focus on the Kharanos region, and try 
                        to display it.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">With 
                        a few new levels under his belt <i>(the difference being 
                        displayed in the picture on the left, including a brand 
                        new guild affiliation)</i>, it is time for my Paladin 
                        to go back to Anvilmar, and try to get a few new skills 
                        through the Paladin Trainer, Bromos Grummner. . For the 
                        time being, I pick Divine Favor, a spell that will protect 
                        me from any attack or spell for 6 seconds. This seems 
                        like a perfect spell for someone who likes to solo. </font></p>

                        the way back to Anvilmar, I also pick a quest that will 
                        send me across the mountains to deliver a letter from 
                        Grelin, and take the opportunity to sell some of the junk 
                        items that I found while I was looting. Adlin Pridedrift, 
                        a merchant near the location where I picked the first 
                        quest accepts to buy them. It should be noted that, thankfully, 
                        you can go to any type of merchant to sell your loot.</font></p>

                        through a Tunnel guarded by Troggs, and deliver the letter 
                        I received, to Senir Whitebeard in Kharanos. The cave 
                        is filled with Rockjaw Raiders, Humanoids who look like 
                        they just escaped the cave age. Although I was warned 
                        of a tough fight, there are only a few Rockjaw Raiders 
                        in the cave and they are no match for my level. I guess 
                        that I will not be able to try Divine Favor yet. </font></p>

                        reach the other side of the cave without any problem, 
                        and find myself in another valley still covered with snow. 
                        After a short trip, I eventually find Kharanos, where 
                        I deliver the letter and take some time to inspect the 
                        area. Kharanos is a small village with only two buildings. 
                        Most of the creatures in this area are beasts (Wolves, 
                        Bears, Boars). Some Wendigos are also present, but they 
                        tend to stay in or near their caves.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                        first thing that I notice in Kharanosis a Gunsmith Trainer. 
                        I still have to find yet what class would be better-suited 
                        with this skill. I doubt that it would be a Paladin, though. 
                        In Kharanos Hall, I find a few Trainers and Merchants, 
                        including an Apprentice Cloth &amp; Leather, an Armorer, 
                        a Blacksmithing Supplier, and a Weaponsmith. No sight 
                        of any other Paladin trainer though, at least in this 
                        building.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050226090228/http://www.ultimategamers.com/worldofwarcraft/beta/images/physician.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050226090228im_/http://www.ultimategamers.com/worldofwarcraft/beta/images/physicianthumb.jpg" width="128" height="96" align="right" alt="Physician" border="0"></a>The 
                        other building offers more choices, including some class 
                        Trainers (Warrior, Priest), and a Physician. A Physician 
                        will teach you how to to create bandages to heal you. 
                        This might be an interesting training skill to learn, 
                        but I will pass for the time being, still having to discover 
                        more. While continuing my exploration of the building, 
                        I eventually find another Paladin Trainer. This one has 
                        a lot more skills to offer than the first one I met. Too 
                        bad my pockets are empty and I can't really afford anything 
                        fancy. I will settle then for Healing Aura, which can 
                        be handy for any group I decide to join. The only thing 
                        to remember is that a Paladin can only have one aura active 
                        at a time, so I will have to select either Healing or 
                        Devotion (armor). Of course, should I meet another Paladin 
                        in a group, both of us could pick a different aura, which 
                        would doubly-benefit the group.</font></p>

                          to bring back some Ribs as well as some beer from the 
                          Bartender. A total waste of a Paladin's time in my opinion, 
                          but with empty pockes, I do not have that much choice. 
                          While I'm in Kharanos, I decide to pick another quest, 
                          in case it brings me to the same area of my first quest. 
                          In World of Warcraft, there are no time limits for quests, 
                          and picking up a few at the same time always save you 
                          some trips. After all, Dwarf legs are not really set 
                          for long walks, so I will spare as much energy as I 
                          can.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00"><br>

                        working on my quests, I am met by Sennyo, another member 
                        of the Ultimate Gamers guild. Guilds are very well structured 
                        in World of Warcraft. They offer several ranks, with some 
                        privileges for the two top ranks, Officer and Leader. 
                        The Guild Leader and Guild Offers can promote everyone 
                        to levels under them, demote them, ban them from the guild, 
                        and of course recruit. Only the Guild Leader and Guild 
                        Officers can invite other players to a Guild. </font></p>

                        we learned from Sennyo's visit was that Sennyo (Night 
                        Elf) could nt understand other Dwarves, as she has not 
                        learned their language. However, she could understand 
                        me (Dwarf) through guild chat. </font></p>

                        to hunting. All the quests found in Kharanos proved as 
                        easy as I expected them to be, with the exception of the 
                        Wendigos. These tough creatures are well-organized and 
                        hang in groups. Beat one and it runs towards its family, 
                        and before you know it, you have 3 or 4 on your back. 
                        <i>I wish players that you meet in this cave were as organized 
                        as these creatures! Unfortunately, a majority of players 
                        do not seem to have any MMORPG experience, and people 
                        in a group will continue looting while you're fighting, 
                        or just disappear out of reach without warning. Hopefully, 
                        when the game goes gold, more mature players will be found.</i> 
                        The reward for all these quests was somewhat good moneywise, 
                        and helped me reach level 7 and a new talent. I picked 
                        another level of proficiency in 2-hand maces to inflict 
                        more damage.</font></p>

                        completing the above quests, my Paladin receives two new

                        towards a new area, Brenwall Village. These quests, and 
                        a presentation of this region, will be covered shortly
