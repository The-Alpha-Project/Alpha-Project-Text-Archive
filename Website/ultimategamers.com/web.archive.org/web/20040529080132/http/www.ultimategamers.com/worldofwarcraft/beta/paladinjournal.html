                        of a character, from its conception to its early levels. 
                        More than building a journal, I will also try to explain 
                        all the mechanisms that are necessary to make a better 
                        character, through experience, picking up trading crafts, 
                        finding a proper equipment, and selecting the right talents.

                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#00FF00"><b>Location:</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                        Dwarves start their journey at Coldridge Valley, a remote 
                        outpost in Dun Morogh. This starting location is also 
                        shared by the Gnomes.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">Equipment:</font></b> 
                        As can be expected, a new character starts with very limited 
                        equipment (pants, shirt, shoes, and a Hammer in the case 
                        of the Paladin).</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF"><b><font color="#00FF00">Skills 
                        and spells:</font></b> A Paladin starts with four skills 
                        or spells: Attack, Dodge, Defend, Holy Strike, and Holy 
                        Light. Dodge and Defend are both Passive skills, Attack 
                        is an active skill, Holy Strike is an offensive skill, 
                        and Holy Light is a healing spell (which requires mana).</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">All 
                        skills start at a minimum. For example, Dodge (which regulates 
                        your ability to avoid being hit) starts with a 0.00% chance 
                        of avoiding being hit. Through combat, each skill will 
                        automatically be raised, depending on the actions that 
                        you perform. </font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">Acquiring 
                        new skills will come through leveling, and finding the 
                        appropriate Trainer. Trainers can be found in cities and 
                        towns and will require you to pay for their services.</font></p>

                        Another essential element of improving your character 
                        is through the acquisition of talents. Talents do not 
                        require any Trainer or money, and will be granted to you 
                        when you level.</font></p>
                      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FFFFFF">Talents 
                        can improve your character either through an enhancement 
                        of its attributes (strength, dexterity, stamina, etc.). 
                        This will in turn sharpen your character's defensive skills, 
                        increase his magical attacks, or build up his proficiency 
                        in the use of a weapon. Talents will vary depending on 
                        your character class. </font></p>

                        of World of Warcraft is the ability to perform actions 
                        to improve your equipment, make potions, create food, 
                        etc. Called crafting in other games, these trading skills 
                        add a lot to the interactivity of the game. Whether you 
                        specialize in blacksmithing (to make better armor or weapons), 
                        tailoring (to make better cloths for classes who can't 
                        wear armor), fishing (to create food and speed up your 
                        recovery), enchantment (to create health or mana potions), 
                        or any of the numerous available trading skills, you will 
                        be rewarded by having a better character, socializing 
                        with other players, and making some money for selling 
                        the items you crafted, as they are usually cheaper than 
                        when bought through a merchant.</font></p>

                        Quests can be found through NPCs. The number of available 
                        quests is impressive (175 for each race). Not only can 
                        you do quests that are given by NPCs of your own race, 
                        but you can also do those offered by other races of your 
                        faction (Alliance or Horde). This is important to know 
                        as (if you like to play solo), you may find yourself out 
                        of quests in your level range. A travel to other races' 
                        locations will then offer you a brand new number of quests 
                        that you will accomplish until you feel confident enough 
                        to go back to your own race's quests. Unlike other games, 
                        quests can only be accomplished once. This said, you can 
                        drop a quest at any time, there is no time limit to accomplish 
                        them (so far), and even if you lose an item important 
                        for the quest, you can always abandon the quest, go back 
                        to the NPC who gave it, and reacquire the item. NPCs who 
                        deliver quests have an exclamation mark on top of them. 
                        A yellow exclamation mark means that your level is high-enough 
                        to do the quest (which may mean that you need a full party 
                        to do it), and a silver one means that your level is not 
                        high enough to do the quest. Finally, clicking on a NPC 
                        doesn't automatically give you a quest. You always have 
                        the option to accept or decline it.</font></p>

                        The looting system is quite complete. A party leader can 
                        decide to either have a first-come first-serve loot, a 
                        round-robin loot (each player is allowed to loot in turn), 
                        or a master looter (only person allowed to loot). Depending 
                        on the quests, each player will have to do his own loot 
                        to get the items required to finish the quest, or a boss 
                        will drop as many unique items as necessary. Loots will 
                        deliver weapons, armor, food, crafting items, money, or 
                        a combination of all. Quest-specific items can only be

                        means that they will not attack unless attacked first. 
                        To attack them, I just need to get in range, right-click 
                        on them, then select one of my skills or spells. It takes 
                        a few kills to gather all the meat, as some of the wolves 
                        do not give it away. Through the quest, my skills have 
                        improved and I also reached level 2, which means that 
                        I can now select a new talent. I pick Heroic Strength, 
                        which will raise my strength by 1. Time to return to Sten, 
                        get my reward and pick up a new quest.</font></p>

                        Balir Frosthammer offers a quest that is very similar 
                        to the first one I completed, and asks to kill 5 Rockjaw 
                        Troggs, and 5 Burly Rockjaw Troggs. This time though, 
                        I only have to kill them and each kill will count into 
                        the completion of the quest, as I do not have to pick

                        any shield. As I have to kill two kind of critters, I 
                        switch my view mode so that it now displays their name 
                        and health bar (but also make it more difficult to find 
                        players). The quest completion brings me to level 3, and 
                        I am about ready to explore the world. But I must find

                        we defeat the boss. As we are in the same party, we only 
                        need to kill him once and both retrieve the journal. Back 
                        to Grelin again.</font></p>

                        Through these quests, my Paladin has now reached level 
                        6, and has gained a few talents. I have now added 2H Mace 
                        Specialization, which helps my Paladin deliver more damage 
                        with two-hand maces, such as the Hammer that he wields. 
                        It is now time to take him outside this little enclave, 
                        and find him some Trading skills. </font></p>
