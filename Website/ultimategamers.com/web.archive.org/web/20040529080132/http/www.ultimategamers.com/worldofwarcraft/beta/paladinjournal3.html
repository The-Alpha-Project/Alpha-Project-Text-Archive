                        journal of our Paladin continues with the exploration 
                        of the area around Brenwall Village, where quests sent 
                        him after visiting Kharanos.</font></p>

                        he has now reached level 8, our Paladin has still not 
                        evolved a lot when it comes to spells acquisition. His 
                        healing is still basic, and his damage only improved a 
                        little, mainly thanks to the acquisition of a new mace 
                        found while looting. The only major improvements came 
                        through an encounter with Sennyo (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050303091406/http://www.ultimategamers.com/worldofwarcraft/beta/images/elric6to8.JPG">see

                        in most other games, trading with other players is very

                        reached level 8 and accepted the only two quests that 
                        were available for him in Kharanos, which both led to 
                        Brenwall. As mentioned in other parts of the journal, 
                        it is always a good idea to get as many quests as possible 
                        at the same time, to avoid running back and forth between 
                        places.</font></p>

                        listed as a village, Brenwall looks more like a camp where 
                        Dwarves gather. There are no solid structure, but only 
                        tents gathered around a fire. Wolves, Snow Leopards, Bears, 
                        and Trolls abound around the camp, and usually hunt in 
                        pack, which may mean the end of my solo adventures. The 
                        quests found in Brenwall, including the first two that 
                        are given outside this area are:</font></p>

                      Evershine was easy. It only required to travel from Kharanos 
                      to Brenwall, not a long walk. To go there, follow the road 
                      to the north until you find a bridge, then turn left and 
                      walk on the iced river until it turns into a lake. The camp 
                      is on the other side of the lake.</font></p>

                      this new area is also mainly inhabited by beasts, the main 
                      difference that I notice here is that some species here 
                      act and react in groups. Attack a Troll, and as soon as 
                      he finds himself in disarray, he retreats and calls for 
                      reinforcement. Before you know it, you can have up to four 
                      Trolls trying to get a piece of your skin. </font></p>

                      a few trials to complete the Frostmane Hold solo, I decide 
                      that I do not have other choices but to form a group, which 
                      proves quite frustrating. My Paladin brings armor and secondary 
                      healing to the group, and in return gets additional firepower 
                      to fight groups of Trolls. After getting my head count, 
                      I come back to Brenwall Village and complete &quot;A Favor 
                      for Evershine&quot;, a slay quest that is completable solo. 
                      Frostmane Hold will require me to go back to Kharanos to 
                      be completed. Before heading back, I pick up a few additional 
                      quests in this area.</font></p>

                      Perfect Stout quests proves too much for my Paladin. Although 
                      he doesn't die, thanks to his <b>Divine Intervention</b> 
                      skill that allows him to flee danger and stay unharmed for 
                      six seconds, it is clear that this quest is not soloable 
                      for a level 9 character (I leveled up while reaching the 
                      destination). Two solutions are now available: wait for 
                      some reinforcements or head back to Kharanos and complete 
                      the other quests, and visit the Paladin Trainer.</font></div>

                        decide to wait a little and, eventually, a Rogue, two 
                        Warriors, and another Paladin arrive. We group and slowly 
                        but surely, defeat the Trolls. Most of them are spellcasters 
                        that inflict about 50 damage for each spell they cast. 
                        Considering that they are never alone, and that a level 
                        9 character only has around 270 HP, it is clear that a 
                        little strategy is needed to defeat them. This time, the 
                        group works very well, the Warriors tanking while the 
                        two Paladins offer additional armor and also act as healers. 
                        We notice that some baskets are randomly place within 
                        the camps. It turns out that they also deliver the weeds 
                        that we are looking for.</font></p>

                        status. If you want to apply a spell on any member of 
                        the group, you can either click on the icon, or you can 
                        just hit one of the functions keys. F1 will apply a spell 
                        to you, and F2 to F5 will apply the spell to other players. 
                        Note that auras are automatically applied to everybody 
                        in your group. Note that you don't need to be close to 
                        a group to be invited. A player can just type /invite 
                        followed by your name, and even if you are on the other 
                        edge of the map, you will receive the invitation.</font></p>

                        quest that requires me to go to deliver another keg of 
                        beer to another region. As no other quests seem to be

                        buildings in Steelgrill's Depot. This trainer allows you

                        another trading skill, mining, which can be acquired through

                        transaction. Before that, I complete the quest that initially 
                        sent me to the village, and receive another one that will 
                        bring me to Ironforge.</font></p>

                        never look well enough: </font></b>While hunting around 
                        Brenwall village, I noticed some Leper Gnomes guarding 
                        what seemed to be two of their camps. These Gnomes can 
                        be found on your way to the Frostmane Hold quest. I initially 
                        thought that I would eventually get a quest in Brenwall 
                        village to kill them, but after completing all quests, 
                        I still didn't see any NPC with an exclamation mark above 
                        his head. Being stubborn, and not willing to leave the 
                        area without completing all the quests, I asked for help 
                        in general chat (which I usually avoid). I was told that 
                        the quest was given in Kharanos. So, as I was in Kharanos, 
                        I decided to look around. None of the obvious buildings 
                        had any quests for me. I eventually found the quest location 
                        with the help of a player , and I have to admit that without 
                        him, I would never have found the building. If you want 
                        to do the quest, you need to pinpoint a building northwest 
                        of Kharanos. This building is almost underground! The 
                        best way to locate it is to follow the road to the north 
                        (as if you were going to Brenwall Village). Right after 
                        you leave town, look for a narrow path to your left. This 
                        is where you will find the quest! The bottom line is that 
                        if you find a group of mobs in an area, there is certainly 
                        a quest associated with them. Don't hesitate to ask about 
                        it in general chat.</font></p>
