 Happy Holidays!
  The holidays are here and the citizens of Azeroth are celebrating the 
  occasion with festive decorations and winter time activities.  Keep an
  eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!


 New Dungeon - Maraudon
  In the vast gray of Desolace lies the earthen tomb of Zaetar, fallen 
  Keeper of the Grove and son of Cenarius.  Zaetar rejected his Keeper 
  heritage when he joined with the princess of the chaotic earth 
  elementals, Theradras. Their unholy union gave birth to the misshapen 
  and cursed centaur, who promptly slew their father for his part in 
  their misbegotten creation. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, the 
  grief-stricken Theradras sequestered her dead lover's body in her 
  secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of Therramok, where she watches 
  over him to this day. Travelers who come to Desolace have little 
  trouble spotting Zaetar's tomb, for the blessing of nature that 
  permeates his being transformed his resting place into a verdant 
  paradise of flora and tranquil pools. Today, this tomb is now trodden 
  by the hooves of Zaetar's children, who have claimed this great cavern 
  as their sacred stronghold Maraudon.

  Maraudon, a level 40-49 dungeon in Desolace, is now open and ready for
  business.


 Cloak & Helm Graphics
  There are now interface options that let you not display your helm 
  and/or cloak on your character. These options will allow a player to wear a 
  cloak or helm, but not have it show up in the game world. The check 
  boxes to control this functionality are in the Options menu under 
  "Interface Options."


 General
- Players will now receive credit for killing a monster even if 
  they die during battle.
- Players will now be able to purchase and train mounts from other 
  races in their faction.  However, you will first need to obtain 
  "exalted" reputation status with that race in order to do so.  
  Mounts of the opposing faction are not available for purchase.
- A "Looking for Group" channel has been added. Additional improvements 
  in looking for group functionality will be added in future patches.
- Daze chance has been reduced in degrees depending on the level of the 
  monster versus the level of the player.  Thus, a monster will have a 
  better chance to Daze a player equal in level than it would Dazing a 
  player five levels higher.
- If you die in Molten Core, you will now be able to retrieve your 
  corpse at the Blackrock Depths instance line.

  been fixed. This spell now correctly requires channeling.


 Player versus Player

  that free-for-all PvP will only take place on the floor of the arena, 
  and no longer in the stands or on the entrance ramp.  Please keep in

  attack you anywhere in the arena because Stranglethorn Vale is a 
  contested area.

  Onyxia encounter.  **During the beta testing there will be a 
  temporary placeholder vendor who sells keys to Onyxia’s lair for 
  testing purposes. 

  Discovered in the heart of Blackrock Mountain beyond the Depths, 
  lies the Molten Core.  Within the Molten Core lives a multitude of 
  ancient and powerful evil.  Adventurers be ware, for the dangers found 
  within the Molten Core are many and takes many forms.

  **Raid loot is being worked on and temporary loot has been placed in 
  raid encounters 


 New Kodo mounts!
  There is but one creature in all of Kalimdor that possesses the 
  strength and stamina to bear a tauren rider into battle: the 
  majestic kodo beast. Swifter and slightly smaller than their 
  wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same 
  resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits 
  that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. It 
  is said that only the most virtuous of tauren can win the affection 
  of a kodo war mount, for these mighty beasts only serve those that 
  approach them with honor and respect in 
  their hearts.

  Tauren players will no longer have the Plainsrunning ability, due 
  to the availability of Kodo mounts!  Tauren players can purchase the 
  Kodo mount at Bloodhoof village.

  **Currently there is an active bug that prevents players from 
  purchasing mounts from different races regarding of reputation, this 
  bug will be addressed in the next patch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 0.12.0 (2004-10-10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Durability

  Item durability is now in the game. Item durability is an important 
  aspect of World of Warcraft that will work to stabilize the economy, 
  decrease inflation specifically in the high end game, and in general 
  keep prices of player sold items lower than normally would occur without 
  such a feature.  Durability should also add additional depth to the game 
  since players will have more variety in their items and more abilities 
  will be added over time to interact with durability. Item durability is 
  different from item decay in that players will never lose items through 
  item durability.

  Durability key points
- All armor and weapons have durability, but not trinkets, cloaks, shirts, 
  guild tabards, necklaces and rings.
- Items remain at full effectiveness until they have no durability. Their 
  power does not degrade.
- Items cannot permanently break.
- All armor/weapon vendors can repair durability in exchange for cash.
- When an item reaches zero durability, it no longer gives the player any 
  benefit; it acts as though it does not exist until repaired.
- Professions cannot repair durability, but we will discuss ways for the 
  professions to interact with them in the future.


  Raid Groups

- Raid groups will no longer receive quest bounties and collections.  
  In the future, we plan to have raid-specific quests that will be 
  possible to complete in raid groups.

  back in.

  are now independent of stat attributes.
- The camera will now stay above or below water depending on which 
  side you are on.

  the game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 0.11.0 (2004-9-28)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  New Model & Animation System



- Extensive changes have been made to the model and animation system in

  order to increase performance when playing in densely populated areas

  such as cities and PvP encounters. Specifically, we have added hardware

  vertex shader support and a hardware cursor for those cards that support

  it. Because we are still transitioning to the new system, you will

  experience some incomplete animation features or graphical glitches

  while playing this patch. Please report any issues you may find using

  the /bug command from within the game. 

 

  Talent System

- Warlock talents have been partially implemented. Two talent trees, 
  Destruction and Affliction, are now in the game. Changes continue to be
  made to Warlock talents, and include modification of the present
  talents and the addition of a third talent tree to be announced later.
  Warlocks can now utilize the talent interface by pressing the “Talents”
  button next to the “Spellbook and Abilities” button, or by pressing the
  “N” default hotkey.




  New Looting Methods



  Group Loot 


- When an item equal to or above the threshold (details on threshold

  below) drops from a killed monster, everyone in the group will see a 
  pop-up box on their screen with the item, a pass or roll option, and 
  a timer. Anyone who rolls displays a number between 1 and 100. The 
  player who rolled the highest number automatically gets the item. Anyone
  who waits until the timer expires automatically passes. Items below 
  the threshold are taken care of by normal round robin rules.



  
  Need Before Greed


- Same as group loot, except players who cannot use the item automatically

  pass.

  
  Threshold

- This setting determines the level of items that are affected by the new

  loot options outlined above.ÊIf a party sets the threshold to blue items

  and is in group loot mode, then all items of green quality and lower

  will be handled with the normal round robin rules. If a party sets the

  threshold to green items, then white and grey items will be handled by

  normal rules.





  General

  except when everyone in the party has completed the questline, at which
  point the princess will be gone and the High Priestess will be in her
  place.

- More quests added to both Eastern and Western Plaguelands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  High End Locations added

- Two new high-level instance dungeons - Stratholme and Blackrock Spire – 
  and three exterior zones – Winterspring, Western Plaguelands, and
  Eastern Plaguelands – have been introduced to Azeroth.

- Stratholme is geared toward level 55-60 players and is located in the 
  northern part of Eastern Plaguelands.
- Blackrock Spire is a 53-60 dungeon located within Blackrock Mountain
  that lies between Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes. Roughly 80% of the
  dungeon is tuned for a single group of level 55-60 players. The top
  20% of the dungeon is tuned for a very "uber" group of five, or more
  likely 10, level 60 players.
- Winterspring is exterior level 55-60 zone to the East/Northeast of
  Felwood through Timbermaw Hold. The goblin city of Everlook is located

  Plaguelands.  Eastern Plaguelands is still undergoing further work.

  to fight together in instance dungeons and work together to 
  accomplish tasks too difficult for five member groups.  Once a group
  reaches five members, it can be converted into a raid group.  Raid
  groups can support up to 40 members and can be accessed by opening the
  Raid group tab in the Social window. Not all raid group functionality
  is complete. However, we encourage our players to try it out and give 
  us feedback on the new feature through the /suggest function.

- The Deeprun Tram opens!

  to connect the great cities of Ironforge and Stormwind City. Final
  work on this new mass transit system was completed recently, allowing
  us to announce the Grand Opening of the Deeprun Tram! Two trains make
  round trip runs between Stormwind City and Ironforge regularly,
  allowing quick and easy access to all your shopping and training needs.
  If you happen to miss a train, you only need to wait a few minutes 
  for a new one to appear. We only ask that you be careful during 
  your trip as the run out of the tunnel can be long and uneventful 
  should you happen to fall off the tram during transit.


  Trades Skills become Professions

- Most trade skills are being renamed to "professions," and the way in 
  which players acquire and learn them is changing. You will no longer
  learn different professions by paying for them with skill points. 
  You'll still learn them by speaking to the appropriate profession 
  trainer.  However, players will now be restricted to learning two 
  professions.  We decided to change the skill system to make it simpler,
  balanced, and more intuitive. The new system should allow everyone to
  participate in one to two professions, and create a much more vibrant
  market for goods generated from professions.  

- The professions are: alchemy, blacksmithing, enchanting, engineering, 
  herbalism, mining, leatherworking, skinning, and tailoring.

- Several old trade skills are being turned into secondary skills. 
  These do not count toward your two-profession limit, so players can 
  learn all three secondary skills, in addition to their two 
  professions, without restriction. The survival skill is being removed
  and campfires have been folded into the cooking profession.

- The secondary skills are: cooking, fishing, and first aid.


  No More Skill Points

- With the changes to trade skills, skill points (SP) will be removed 
  from the game,and currency will be used instead to train skills 
  formerly based on SP.

- Mount trainers will now require you to have a certain level of 
  reputation with their respective city in order to acquire a mount. 

- Characters that had trained in more than two professions have had 
  excess 
  professions randomly removed to meet the two profession restriction.


  Level Cap Raised

- The level cap has been increased to 60. Some new zones, quests,
  items, and content have been added to accommodate the level increase.


  Talent System
 
- Druid and Shaman talents are now available.  Druids and Shamans can
  now utilize the talent interface by pressing the “Talents” button next
  to the “Spellbook and Abilities” button, or by pressing the “N” 
  default hotkey.  Talents become available (to classes that currently
  have talents) to players starting at level 10.
- Certain talents have had their potency increased or decreased.
- Locations of talents in the talent trees have changed.

- New talents have been added to some of the existing talent trees.


  Professions

- The level requirements for the Gnome and Goblin engineering quests 
   have been adjusted downward.
- Blacksmithing recipes added up to skill 300.  There are no recipe
  s on the trainer past skill 250. You need to do quests or find drops
  to get those recipes.   
- Additional blacksmithing specializations added.  Weaponsmiths can
  become Swordsmiths, Axesmiths, or Hammersmiths.
- Players who already have either blacksmithing specialization, 
  weaponsmith or armorsmith, will continue to be able to make those 
  recipes that they already know.  However, to learn further recipes
  in those specializations, they will need to complete the weaponsmith
  or armorsmith quest, respectively.
- Time required to make high-end profession items significantly
  reduced.
- Essences, dusts and shards have had their vendor sell price set to 
  zero.
- Bandaging operates differently than it used to.  Bandages now are 
  channel cast and heal over time.  If the player bandaging or the
  player being bandaged is struck in combat, the bandaging effect ends. 
  Either way the target still gets the "recently bandaged" debuff. 
- Enchanters can now enchant leather and thorium (needed for some 
  high-end blacksmithing recipes and soon other high-end recipes in 
  other professions).
- Alchemists can now transmute thorium and arcane crystals into
  arcanite.  This is the only way to acquire this rare material.
- Stats on a number of tailored items have been improved.

  type set and are now bind on equip or bind on acquire.

  Spike (more powerful crafted item) added.

  and in a new way as well.

  someday).


  Factions and Reputation

- The Horde and Alliance are each comprised of four races, 
  and each is considered its own faction. They are displayed
  under the appropriate Horde or Alliance header.
- Factions are now displayed with appropriate headers in the 
  Reputation UI.
- Factions that do not fall into a larger group are labeled
  under the "Other" header.

  reputation level of Hated, and are always locked in the “At War”
  state.

  that Hunters can start out in.

  started on it.
- Cenarion Circle Caches no longer give a coin award.
- Evergreen Pouches, not Packets of Tharlendris Seeds, are now
  the device used to make Morrowgrain.  Using a pouch creates an
  Evergreen Herb Casing, which when opened reveals what herb is
  made.
- Evergreen Pouches now require that you have a Packet of 
  Tharlendris Seeds and two Un'Goro Soil samples to use.
- Evergreen Pouches have a cooldown time of 10 minutes on
  usage.
- The potential herbs drawn from a Sealed Evergreen Pouch have
  been modified to include a broader range of herbs.  As a result,
  players will not be getting high-end herbs as often on pouch 
  usages.
- Scalding Mornbrew is now removed from the inventory five minutes 
  after receiving it.
- Two new Warlock class quest series added for players in their
  mid 30s ending with two very nice items. 


  Zones

- The Barrens has had more rework done on their quests to make the
  area more player-friendly and to elaborate on the story behind 
  the area.
- Thousand Needles has had more quests and zone rework done. Horde 
  players should find this a much healthier alternative to Hillsbrad
  Foothills to explore and do more quests.
- Desolace has also had a facelift and should be getting more quests
  soon.
- Two new crypts have been added to Ravenhill Cemetary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 0.9.0 (2004-08-15)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hunters

- The Hunter Class is now available to test!  Hunters track, tame, and slay all
  manner of animals and beasts found in the wild. Whether they rely on bows or 
  firearms, Hunters consider their weapons and pets to be their only true 
  friends.  Races allowed to become Hunters are the Night Elf, Dwarf, Orc, 
  Tauren, and Troll races.


- Hunters are great for pulling monsters as they are able to set traps that
  hinder monsters that the Hunters pull to attack.  Hunters are also able 
  to use various beast-related special abilities, take on bestial traits 
  that allow them to do things that they could not do normally, use a wide 
  variety of ranged attacks complimented by a few melee abilities, and the 
  ability to control and tame beasts.  

- Hunters are closely related to their pets and must remember to always keep
  their pet’s happiness in mind.  When using a pet, Hunters will notice an 
  icon in the top left corner of their screen that depicts their pet’s level
  of happiness.  The more Hunters use their pets, the lower their pet’s level
  of happiness will become.  Hunters should always remember to feed their pets
  to raise their pet’s level of happiness or worry about their pet abandoning 
  them or even attacking the Hunter!  Hunters are also the only class able to 
  name their pets.

- The Hunter can use the following weapons: Axes, Daggers, Guns or Bows, 
  Crossbows (with training), Fist Weapons (with training), Spears 
  (with training), Staves (with training), Swords (with training), Thrown 
  (with training), Two-Handed Axes (with training), Two-Handed Swords 
  (with training).  The Hunter can use the following: armor: Cloth, Leather,
  Shields, and Mail (at level 40, with training).  

- Boats and Zeppelins Our first pass at Boats and Zeppelins have been added to 
  the world in two locations. A boat has been added between Booty Bay and 
  Ratchet, and a Zeppelin has been added between Orgrimmar and Tirisfal.  
  A second zeppelin has also been added between Grom'gol and Orgrimmar. 
  The round trip on all three of these new transports is around five minutes,
  with a pause at each destination of one minute each. If you do miss a 
  transport, you will have a very short wait before it returns. If you log 
  out or crash during your journey, you will log back in on the same transport
  as you logged out on, though you will likely be at a different location along
  its path. Because this was the original intention for our world travel, the
  instant teleport NPC's have been removed. Please do not jump off of Boats
  and/or Zeppelins when riding them. Keep in mind that the Goblin Transit 
  Authority is not responsible for accidents of this nature and you may land
  in a place where you cannot reach your corpse.

 
 Talent System

- Talents are now available for the Priest and Rogue classes! Priest and Rogue
  players can now utilize the talent interface by using the "Talents" button
  which resides next to the "Spellbook and Abilities" button, or by pressing
  the "N" default hotkey. 

- Talents for other classes will continue to be added as the beta progresses. 
  Please note that all Mages and Warriors have had their talent points refunded.
  You will now start earning talent points at level 10.  

- Finally, for the duration of the beta, you will be able to find an NPC in each 
  city that will allow you to reset your talent points and experiment with 
  different talent paths.  (Note: this option is ONLY available in the beta).


 Level Cap Raised

- The level cap has been increased to 55. New zones, quests, items and content 
  have been added to accommodate the level increase.


 Item Stats Changed

- Items have had a major overhaul. Armor values, damage, stats and resists have
  been modified to reflect current play balance. Some items have also had their
  level requirements changed.  Items that were subjected to this change and
  that were equipped on a character prior to the Patch have been placed in the 
  character's bag. If a character did not have space in the its bags, please make
  room for that characters bags and relog in.

    hand for dual-wielding purposes.

 Sharing Quests

- You can now share your quests with your entire party.  In order to utilize 
  this option, you need to open your quest log, select a quest and press the
  “Share Quest” button. All members of your party will now be presented with
  the quest like you were the quest giver NPC.


 Some restrictions 

  * You can only share with party members
  * Party members must be nearby when you share
  * Party members must meet the pre-requisites of the quest itself. For 
    example, if you are on step 2 of a quest and your friend is still on 
    step 1, you could not give him a “short-cut” to step 2.
  * Quests generated from items cannot be shared.

 
 New Micro-Dungeon Designs

- The Level Designers have gone in to the game and redesigned some of the
  Goldmine and Mushroom Cave Micro-Dungeons.  Players can now find these 
  redesigned Micro-Dungeons in both Alliance and Horde lands.  

- Goldmines in Hillsbrad, Mulgore, and Blasted Lands have been redesigned. 

- Mushroom Caves in Searing Gorge, Wetlands, Western Plaguelands, Felwood, 
  Hinterlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Arathi Highlands, Ungoro Crater, 
  Deadwind Pass, Stranglethorn and Redridge have been redesigned.


 Be sure to visit all of these areas to see exactly which Micro-Dungeons 
 have been redesigned!

    all the same situations melee is prevented.

    will effect in the others.

    reputation will result eventually in becoming Unfriendly with the local
    populace; names and target reticules will appear in orange to indicate 
    this status.  While reputation remains at Unfriendly, players cannot 
    interact with vendors, trainers, etc. that are the faction in question.

    Both of these are indicated by red names and target reticules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 0.8.0 (2004-07-07)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auction Houses

Auctioneer NPCs have been placed in each major city (Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimmar, Thunder
Bluff and The Undercity). The Auctioneer’s are faction specific, allowing Alliance characters to trade
with other Alliance characters and Horde characters to trade with other Horde characters. Each city’s
Auction House is run independently; all Auctioneers that exist in the same city are all a part of the
same Auction House. One non-faction based Auction House is located in Booty Bay. The Booty Bay Auctioneer
NPCs have the same functionality as the aforementioned faction based Auction Houses, with the additional
capability of allowing trade between Horde and Alliance characters. Sellers are able to place items up
for auction, set a starting price, set the auction duration and include a buyout price by speaking with
an Auctioneer. All auctions will be initially charged a deposit fee; the deposit fee is refunded upon the
successful sale of the item. All successful sales are charged an auction consignment fee which is
extracted directly from the final sale price. Sellers are able to cancel an auction at any time, however;
their deposit fee will be lost if a player elects to exercise this option. All fees are higher in Booty
Bay. Buyers are able to search through items up for auction, place bids and purchase items that include
buyout prices by speaking with the Auctioneer. Players are not able to place bids on items being sold by
a character on their own account. All items won at an Auction House will be delivered through the in-game
mail system.
  

Talent System

Talents are now available for the Warrior and Mage classes! Players can open the talent interface by
using the "Talents" button which resides next to the "Spellbook and Abilities" button, or by pressing the
"N" default hotkey. Talents will eventually be available for all classes.
 

PvP Changes

Players that die in PvP, either versus another player or versus a PvP-Flagged NPC must now wait 2 minutes
before resurrecting at their corpse. This delay does not apply to players that are resurrected by other
players or by using resurrection items. Control types of spells such as Charm, Fear and Stun will now be
subject to diminishing returns. This means that if a second spell of the same type is used against the
same player within 15 seconds of the first effect wearing off, the second spell’s duration will be
reduced by 50%, the third’s duration will be reduced by 75% and the player will be immune to the fourth
casting.


Rest State Changes

The Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now two tiers of rest states: Rested = 200%
experience and Normal = 100% experience. At level one, players will all start in the normal tier.  When a
player rests be it in a city or at an inn they will gain rest bonus at a very slow rate.  Eight hours of
rest will be needed for a player to gain one "bubble" of rest bonus.  At any given time, players will be
able to accumulate a maximum of 30 "bubbles" worth of rest bonus which translates into approximately 1.5
levels worth of rested play (before your character returns to normal rest state). The changes to the Rest
State have been made with the understanding that most players will be in the Normal experience tier most
of the time. The Rested tier is primarily intended for players that take a day or more off from playing
or are very casual with their play schedules. This has enabled us to greatly reduce the experience
necessary for all players to level regardless of which rest state tier they play under.


New Guard System

A new guard system has been added. This new system will enable NPCs to call for guards when they see an
enemy as well as when they are attacked. The guards will chase players and then return to the NPC that
called for help once they lose track of, or kill the player. If a guard is killed, another guard will be
called to take its place. There is a limit to how many guards each town can have which will recharge over
time. The cities that currently have the new Guard System in place are: Astranaar, Auberdine, Bloodhoof
Village, Brill, Crossroads, Goldshire, Razor Hill, Sen’jin Village, Sentinel Hill, Sepulcher and
Thelsamar. The Guard System will be implemented in other cities in future patches.
