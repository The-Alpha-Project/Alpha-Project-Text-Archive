Patch 0.6 was a beta patch for World of Warcraft that was released on April 13, 2004.

We've finally made all of the races available for simultaneous testing in this Alliance & Horde Phase of our Beta Test. Once the client is downloaded, you will have the option to play all eight races: Human, Undead, Dwarf, Tauren, Gnome, Orc, Night Elf and Troll. Eight classes will also be available, as applicable to each race: Druid, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock and Warrior. You read that right, Druids are available!

We've also added many new features, fixed some broken ones and changed a few things here and there. So, sit back, start the download and take a moment to scan these lengthy patch notes.
Major Changes
Windows 98/ME Loading Bug

There are three common crash errors affecting the World of Warcraft Beta running on Windows 98/ME systems.

These are known issues and fixes are currently under development:

If you start the game and your computer locks up immediately.

Solution:

    Make a shortcut to wow.exe.
    Right click on the shortcut and go to properties.
    In the shortcut tab, go to the target line and add the following two switches after the quotes so that it reads something similar to: "/patchnotes/path to game/wow.exe" -windowed -opengl
    Start the game by using this shortcut.
    You can select a character at the selection screen and then try to enter the world.

If after rebooting or when running the game for the first time you crash out with the (FLT_INVALID_OPERATION) error.

Solution:

    Make a shortcut to wow.exe.
    Right click on the shortcut and go to properties.
    In the shortcut tab, go to the target line and add the following two switches after the quotes so that it reads something similar to: "/patchnotes/path to game/wow.exe" -windowed -opengl
    Re-start the game with the shortcut and you should be able to enter the world.

If you are able to select your character but your computer locks 1/4 of the way through loading.

Solution:

    Start the game and get to the character selection screen.
    When you are at the character selection screen, Alt-Tab out of the game.
    You will get a crash
    Re-start the game.
    Select a character and you should be able to get into the game at this point.

Patching

Due to heavy changes in the way we store the games data, this push will be of nearly the same size as your last download. Unfortunately, this means we wont be able to patch this time around, and instead will ask everyone to download the client again.

If you haven't already done so, please check your email as we are re-sending you your Authentication Key, so you can have it ready for use with the downloader.
Character Hold

All current characters have been placed on hold at this time. This is due in part to all of the changes in our low level areas, the new combat system and the addition of the rest state. We feel that its important to test world advancement from the ground up and we want to take this opportunity to do so.

Secondly, with the new skill system in place, we want to find a way to convert older characters to the new system without having to do a character wipe.
Rest State, Inns & Hearthstones

To broaden and balance some of the gameplay elements, we've incorporated a few new features. One of them is the Rest State modifier, which gives players a time-limited bonus to combat (PvE) experience. This frees up time for exploring other aspects of the game without penalty, such as tradeskilling and social activities, and helps players avoid level-grinding. We've also added Inns, which serve as a good place to hang up your sword or staff for the night because they confer special bonuses. Inns also act as home locations, which our third new feature, Hearthstones, take advantage of. Hearthstones provide a speedy way to travel back to an Inn when you need to take care of business in town or when you're ready to check in and call it a night. The basics of these new features are covered below.

    Rest State

        The Rest state modifier only affects experience earned from killing monsters. It does not affect experience earned from quest rewards or other experience rewards in the game (such as future PvP experience rewards).
        As players kill monsters and gain experience points, they become increasingly tired. Their rest level reflects this tiredness in five tiers: well rested, rested, normal, fatigued and exhausted.
        Well-rested players receive bonus experience points for killing monsters. Rested players receive a smaller bonus. At the normal rest level, players receive no bonus experience points for killing monsters. Fatigued players receive half of the normal experience points from their kills, and when exhausted they will receive a quarter of normal experience from a kill.
        To become well rested and start earning bonus experience from killing monsters again, players must either log out or rest online at an Inn (see below) for several hours.
        Thanks to the comforts of a warm bed and a hearty meal, players who rest or log out at an Inn can regain energy up to the maximum level: well rested (it takes 8 hours to go from exhausted back to well rested). Players who log out anywhere else in the world will only regain energy up to the normal level.
        Note that while your character is resting at an Inn, you can play other characters on your account. The rest state is per character only.

    Inns

        Players can rest or log out at any Inn in the world.
        Inns will be located in all major cities and some towns.
        Whenever players enter an Inn or log out at an Inn, they will effectively be "resting," which is indicated by their portrait flashing yellow.
        Players can leave an Inn at any time and continue fighting monsters; the experience they gain will be based on the Rest level that they have rested up to.
        If players log out in an Inn, they will be able to instantly exit the game as opposed to having to wait 20 seconds before exiting.
        When players log in to play the next day, their well-rested characters will have slept off the ill effects of any nasty debuffs from the day before.

    Hearthstones

        Players use Hearthstones (an inventory item) to cast a spell that teleports them back to their "home locations." Casting the spell will take a reasonable amount of time, to prevent it from being used as an escape mechanism from combat.
        "Checking in" with an Innkeeper will make that Inn the player's current home location, and the player's Hearthstone will then take the player back to that Inn (as opposed to any previous home locations). If the player doesn't have a Hearthstone, the Innkeeper will provide one at no cost.
        Because Hearthstones let players quickly return to town, players can easily log off from within an Inn when they're done playing for the night (or day). If they so choose, players can also use Hearthstones just to return to town to sell items, trade, or train. However, Hearthstones can only be used once per hour.
        Having home locations in the game will let us incorporate other spells that teleport players to these locations, such as how Astral Recall worked when we had bind stones.

Combat Changes

    Characters have a new combat stat called "Attack Power." Attack Power helps determine melee damage dealt. The new Attack Power value is displayed in your character sheet as Power. This value is based on class, level and ability scores. Most classes use strength, but rogues and hunters use a combination of strength and agility. The main purpose of Attack Power is to provide a more consistent effect from buffs, regardless of weapon speed. Slow weapons will receive a larger bonus from your Attack Power than faster weapons which will ultimately balance slow and fast weapons. It is important to note that most attack bonuses in the game now add to your Attack Power.
    The amount of melee damage directly attributed from your weapon has been reduced. Damage is now more closely connected with class, strength and buffs than before. Your weapons are still very meaningful but the combat effect you get from using a higher (or lower) level weapon has been reduced.
    Block values have been added to shields. Blocking an attack no longer avoids all of the damage of an attack. Blocked attacks avoid an amount of damage based on your shield and your character's strength.
    Players will now find it more difficult to fight monsters that are a good deal higher in level than they are. Player chance to hit and damage ("glancing blows") are reduced while the monster's chance to hit and damage ("crushing blows") are increased.
    Miss, Parry, Block, Dodge, Critical Hit, and "Stun from Behind" all have new formulae for determining their percentage chance of occurrence.
    The effect Spirit has on mana and hit point regeneration has been improved. Spirit affects all characters' mana and hit point regeneration rates in and out of combat.
    Your chance to hit with each weapon when fighting with two weapons has gone down, but the total hits from both weapons has gone up. Your total damage output when fighting with two weapons should be higher than fighting with one weapon and a shield, but roughly equal to fighting with a two-handed weapon.
    Off-hand attacks deal of the weapon's designated damage.

New Skill System

The new skill system is in place! Players now earn skill points based on experience points gained from killing monsters. Earned skill points can be spent on tradeskills, weapon proficiencies or to increase attributes.

The new skill UI is in place. You will be able to increase your attributes by spending skill points. Attributes will cost different amounts to increase depending on your class. Attributes with a green bar are your characters primary attributes and will cost the least, while attributes displayed with a red bar are less necessary attributes and will be the most expensive.

New Weapon skills will now be purchased with skill points allowing a wider variety of weapons being available to any given class. Different weapons will have different skill point costs associated with them.

Finally, tradeskills will still be purchased with skill points. You will still need to buy the tradeskills at the tradeskill trainer.
Talents Disabled

Some of the talent functionality, like increasing attributes, has been moved to our new skill system. The rest of the Talent system is being reworked and therefore disabled. Don't worry, you will get talents back, and they will be even cooler than before!
Monster Claiming

Now the first player or group to damage a monster will "tap" them. When the tapped monster dies, that player or group will get the experience and loot from the kill. Other players will be able to tell if a monster is tapped because it's portrait will turn grey. Players are free to help kill the tapped monster, but they will receive no experience or loot from the kill. Even with help, the player or group who initially tapped the monster will gain full experience from the kill. In situations where a much higher level player helped with the kill, some of the experience reward will be reduced.
Experience Distribution Changes

As players become higher level, they will be able to receive experience from a large range of monsters. At low levels, you may get experience from monsters 5 levels lower than you, while at level 60 you will gain experience from monsters 12 levels lower. In the future we will add a user interface to monster portraits so you will always know which monsters give experience for your level.
Quest Rewards

Quest rewards are now labeled as Bind on Acquire. Quest rewards can still be equipped or sold to a merchant, but you will no longer be able to sell or give them to other players. This has been implemented to deter these items from flooding the game economy.
World

Many objects in the world such as buildings, dungeons and cities have undergone a significant data format change to reduce memory usage, increase render performance and minimize future patch sizes.
Cloaks

Due to popular demand, cloaks have been made visible. This will help players customize their characters even more than before.
Other Changes
Death System

    Bodies will decompose after a player is resurrected or revived. We are working on some better art to represent this process.
    The corpse retrieval area has increased to 40 yards.
    Players that revive will now have 50% health and mana.
    Spirit healers are now ghosts and can only be seen by players in ghost form.
    Players can no longer use ghost form as a means to travel to far off locations. Having a spirit healer resurrect you in a graveyard other than the one you appeared at when you died, will always teleport you back to that initial graveyard.
    Players can now use all of the UI in ghost form (i.e. move things around in your backpack, read your quest log, interact with your spellbook etc.)

Cities/Zones

    Darnassus, Stormwind, Orgrimmar and Undercity have all undergone layout changes.
