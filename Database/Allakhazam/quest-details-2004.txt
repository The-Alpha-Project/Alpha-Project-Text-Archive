Argos Nightwhisper in Stormwind City wants 10 Corrupt Brain stems.
Game Description:
Foolish blood elves toil with demonic magic. Have they not witnessed what happened with the naga and with the satyrs of Kalimdor?I fear that the blood elves will meet a similar deformation. Azeroth cannot afford to give birth to another vile race of monsters.I wish to study the brain stems of the satyr and naga so that I might deduce what fate the elves are headed toward. In northern Darkshore, in the thorny caverns of Blackfathom Deeps you will find both satyr and naga.'Tis a long journey, <Name>.End Text:Once I have enough samples to study, my true work can begin. With the corrupted brain stems of both the satyr and naga of Blackfathom Deeps I can try to draw correlation between the mutations.

Perhaps with that gained knowledge we can prevent the blood elves from delving deeper into deformity and evil.

Required items: 10 Corrupted Brain Stems

But knowing that I can contribute to your adventures in my own significant way does bring me some joy.End Text:Here it is, <Name>. A weapon worthy of a champion of the Light such as yourself. I've named it after a great dwarven paladin who was a friend of mine. His name was Verigan... Bosch Verigan. Please take it on behalf of myself and my wife.
