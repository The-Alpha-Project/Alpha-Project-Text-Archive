Elwynn Forest 	

[Click to enlarge]
	Description

Elwynn Forest is a vast woodland that cradles the Human civilization of Azeroth. Several farms stretch across the fertile fields, and the Garrison Guard Towers stand vigilant every few miles, helping to keep the forest safe from evil forces. The tranquil forest is also inhabited by wild bears, wolves and giant tarantulas that hunt throughout the woodlands in hope of finding easy prey. Scraggly Gnolls and grimy Kobolds wander the forest's outlying regions, but seldom do these timorous creatures attack property in Elwynn or Stormwind directly. For the most part, Elwynn exudes a feeling of comfort and serenity, its road well patrolled by the Stormwind Guard

The snow capped highland is teeming with life, bears and snow leopards hunger for weary traveller's flesh. Home to the dwarves and the gnomes after the Fall, it is well guarded with the city of Ironforge looking over its realm.
