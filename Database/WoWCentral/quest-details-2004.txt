From what I've seen, the trolls aren't well situated here in Coldridge Valley--mostly the southern cave. I'd say that the army will not be necessary. A few strong arms should be more than enough.

Quest Description: You must be the new warlock everyone's been whispering about. Must be someone's taken a liking to you if they've asked me to take time away from my resear to start your training.

Don't worry, I won't hold it against you.

Bring me three feather charms from the frostmane novices from the cave to the southwest.

Objectives: Bring 3 Feather Charms to Gozwin Vilesprocket in Anvilmar.

Completion Description: Very good, very good! You've done well. Perhaps the interest that is being shown in you is deserved, after all.

That'll be for the others to decide--assuming your imp doesn't over power you and nip your career in the bud. For now, I'm satisfied that you'll probably survive your first few months as a warlock.

A word about the imp. Don't let it's size foo you, its magic can be very dangerous.

Quest Description: The trogg's in the tunnes are extremely hostile, and haven't shown any hesitation in attacking travelers through the tunnel. You seem tough enough, though, so you should probably be safe.

Directions? If you're going to speak with Senir, you'll find him in Kharanos.

Make your way through the tunnel, and after you come out on the other side, just keep following the road, it'll run right into kharanos.

Objectives: Deliver Grelin's report to Senir Whitebeard in Kharanos.

Completion Description: What's this? Ah, my brother's report.
Hmm...

I told him to be sparing with the use of the King's name, but he didn't listen, No harm, I suppose, though it's sure to ruffle some feathers in the Senate. Not that those weren't some feathers that needed ruffling! Hah!

Nonetheless, I guess that means that I should send my report on to Ironforge as well, but I must admit I'm a bit behind.
Bloody cold.

I should have some work for you later, if you're interested.

Objectives: Kill 6 Ice Claw Bears, 8 Elder Crag Boars, and 8 Snow Leopords, and then return to Rejold Barleybrew in Brewnall Village

Completion Description: Thank you. It'll be nice to work our crafts without hearing so many growls an dsnorts outside the village.
