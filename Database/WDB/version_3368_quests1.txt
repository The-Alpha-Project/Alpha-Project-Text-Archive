QuestDescription: My duties include tending to our wounded warriors, tailoring armor and clothes, and assisting Shadow Priest Sarvis with whatever else he might need.$b$bFrom the look of it, you'll be enlisted in his service also... hunting the Mindless Ones, if I know his mind. Well, if you'd like to stay in one piece--and I've no doubt you do--perhaps I can help. I'm running out of paws and wings, and if you bring me some, I'll find some armor for you. You'll find a good number of wolves and bats to the northwest.

LogDescription: Executor Arren wants you to kill 8 Young Night Web Spiders and 6 Night Web Spiders.
QuestDescription: One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive. Gold was scarce even in the height of the Alliance's power.$b$bThere is a gold mine to the northwest that has been overrun with spiders. We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there. I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little. Get out there and see what you can do.
