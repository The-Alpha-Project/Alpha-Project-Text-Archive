Witchwing Harpys

Einst gaben sie sich damit zufrieden, sich auf ihrem Stammsitz in den Stonetalon Mountains zurück zu ziehen, aber mittlerweile haben die wilden und teuflischen Harpyien ihren Einfluss über die gesamte Länge und Breite des Kontinents ausgedehnt. Die bösen, geflügelten Frauen sind dazu übergegangen, ahnungslose Karawanen und jeden sonst anzufallen, der es wagt, in ihr Territorium einzudringen. So sind ihre Nester, in denen die grausigen Überreste ihrer Opfer verstreut liegen, von den ausgetrockneten Tafelbergen Durotars bis zu den üppigen Wäldern von Kalidar kein seltener Anblick mehr.

basilisks

These powerful, enchanted creatures are an anomaly throughout the world of Azeroth. Not typically known for their capricious tempers, if provoked, the hulking creatures will defend themselves and their nesting sites with ferocious ferocity. Always fond of Stranglethorn's "singing crystals," basilisks discovered that consuming these crystals gave them untold powers, allowing them to put their prey to sleep and even turn them to stone. As a side effect of consuming crystals, basilisks have mutated, the mystical crystals glowing on their scaly hides, granting them even greater powers against their enemies.
