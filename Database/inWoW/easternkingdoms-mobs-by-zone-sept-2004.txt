goblins

These slovenly creatures have a penchant for digging and are known for their underground digs.

gnoll

The cunning gnolls of the Redrige Mountains were a notorious nuisance to both the human and dwarven kingdoms. More recently, however, the Riverpaw Gnolls have been seen to pose a rather serious threat with their raids on human farms and villages across Elwynn. Many speculate that the notoriously goofy gnolls have bonded with another power, endowing them with weapons (crossbows, maces, flails) and sometimes armor (usually gauntlets). They also have tactical combat skills and possess some magic. While it's not clear what the gnolls are after, the Stormwind Marshals now recognize that these creatures pose a clear threat to the kingdom and must be stopped.

Recently, the goblins have found themselves in the role of prey for the merciless gnoll riverpaw pack.
