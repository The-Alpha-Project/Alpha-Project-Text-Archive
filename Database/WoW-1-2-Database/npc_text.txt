1080,"The Earthen are a synthesized race engineered by the Creators, functioning as one of the seed races in the initial population of the world designated as Azeroth.  The Earthen were created to aid the Creators' efforts in shaping the deep regions of this world.$B$BThey are a modification of the standard subterranean being matrix used on other worlds that the Creators have seeded.  The construction of this prototype race created various anomalies that were observed after initial synthesis.","","","","","",""
1081,"It is one of the synthesis matrices the Creators use when seeding a world.  Each synthesis matrix is used to achieve the Creators' goals.  For Azeroth, a subterranean being matrix was modified to create a being with increased durability with an affinity for deep region shaping; the Earthen are the product of this modification.$B$BAfter the Earthen had been put into service for the Creators, unforeseen anomalies were discovered that affected their synthesis matrix due to high-stress environments.","","","","","",""

The Earthen represent the Creators' attempt at improving the survivability paradigm of the standard subterranean being matrix.  This was done by incorporating a resilient foundation of construction inherent to the world into said matrix.","","","","","",""
1083,"It is the baseline material used in race synthesis.  A cross-section of Azeroth's crust was used as the foundation for the Earthen's synthesis rather than the typical biomass construction foundation used by the Creators.$B$BResearch on the world's composition led the Creators to theorize that an enhanced being could be synthesized that would epitomize the resiliency of this world's essence.  This was accomplished by choosing to use a blend of Azeroth's various stone core compounds as the foundation.","","","","","",""
1084,"Simply stated, this is correct.$B$BThe Earthen's physical features are that of a smaller stature humanoid, though their composition is that of Azeroth's various stone core compounds.

Their skin and musculature are nearly impervious to physical damage, and with very minor modifications the Earthen display a remarkable resiliency to unwanted magical forces.","","","","","",""
